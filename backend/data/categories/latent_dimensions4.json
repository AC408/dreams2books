                "review/text": "I had never heard of Ephedra before reading this book.What is Ephedra? It's a Chinese Herb (ma huang), an adrenaline-like stimulant, which has been used for thousands of years. Though in the case of this book, 'ephedra' specifically refers to the synthetic alkaloids ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine (also used in widely available and legal over-the-counter cold remedies). The chemical cocktails referenced by the book were herb weight loss pills that combined Ephedra and caffeine, as sold by the Metabolife corporation and several other companies in the 1990's and early 2000's.If you google 'Ephedra' and look at the Wikipedia article, you'll read the inflated claims this book successfully debunks.The book asserts (with over 10 pages of bibliography articles in respected medical journals) that less people died from using Ephedra than from using Aspirin. That Steve Belcher died from heatstroke and pushing himself too hard (autopsy report cited), and that Korey's Stringer locker contained no Ephedra products when his family emptied it after his death (newspaper article cited). The book includes the passages of the deliberately misinterpreted RAND report (p102-9) and specifically shows how lies were told.Further, the book explains exactly what AER or Adverse Effect Reports are. The 15,000 *unscreened* reports turned over by Metabolife in the hearings included things like consumer complaints about pricing, gunshot deaths, and cases which only mentioned the word 'ephedra' without establishing causation.This book cites (p98) a prospective, two arm, six month, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical safety trial conducted at two sites which appeared in the 2002 edition of the Journal of Obesity. It involved about 200 people. One of the co-authors was once a professor at Harvard Medical School. The conclusion was Ephedra was safe and helped weight loss at 3 additional pounds per month when taken properly with exercise and a fat controlled diet. As a medical journalist the author calls this an unbiased study with 'a scientific gold standard'. He later states bigger studies like this are needed to conclusively show Ephedra is not dangerous (they have never been funded).While the supplements industry did spend $4 million lobbying for their product, the big-pharma industry spent over seven times that, $30 million, getting the product banned (charts p158-161). Why? It is cheaper and perhaps better than (their) weight loss drugs also on the market. The supplement industry makes low billions of dollars, and pharma (worth hundred of billions) wants a piece of it. Chapter six explores industry PR techniques and chapter seven is about how pharma develops drugs at taxpayer expense. While interesting, they had little to do with Ephedra, other than highlight how powerful industry opposition is. Chapter eight shows how much of a farce the congressional hearing were, but is on the boring side.Supplements Under Siege: Inside the Conspiracy to Take Away Your Vitamins, Minerals, and Herbsby this same author examines Pharma's influence in detail.Five stars because the premise of the book is spot on, and the arguments are well documented, well supported, and make sense. This book has convinced me Ephedra is not a dangerous product and was only banned because of industry lobbying. The reason for this lobbying was that Ephedra's results were equal to or surpassed more expensive diet drugs owned by big pharma. I currently have no desire to take Ephedra or other weight loss remedies.",

        "description": "Americans today are working harder, working longer and yet for most of us, in this time of ruthless downsizing and political cronyism, job security, a decent standard of living and a comfortable retirement are becoming harder and harder to find. In this brilliantly funny and right-on-target diatribe, irreverent everyman Michael Moore gives his own bold views on who's behind the fading of the American dream. Whether issuing Corporate Crook trading cards, organizing a Rodney King Commemorative Riot, sending a donation to Pat Buchanan from the John Wayne Gacy fan club (which was accepted) or trying to commit former right-wing congressman Bob Dornan to a mental hospital, the in-your-face host of TV Nation and director/star of Roger & Me combines an expansive wit with biting social commentary to make you think and laugh at the same time. In hardcover, Downsize This! stormed the bestseller lists of the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle and others. Given Michael Moore's enormous -- and growing -- constituency, this trade paperback edition brings his unique perspective on the nation to an even greater audience.",

This book is a bit dated by now, but most of it still applies, unfortunately. His writing on corporate welfare and the way our government gives out 'payoffs for layoffs' to rich corporations is on point. Nothing has changed.Moore sticks it to democrats and republicans in this book, (he opts for the term \"republicrats\") but his brand of humor and truth really seems to get on conservatives' last nerve. ...which is all the better.You can see some of their silly reactionary replies here. Like Ryan Setliff from Lynchburg, VA who titles his review \"For those who think a Job is a Right.\" He says: \"They hold to a Marxist view that a job and economic security is an inherent right.\" Well, what's so humorous about this is not only the idea that Ryan would seemingly rather live in a country where the people can't get jobs and are economically insecure, but that it turns out that a job and economic security *ARE* actually basic and fundamental human rights.Under the leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt, The \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\" was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 and ratified by the United States. This document is basically the standard on which basic human rights are measured throughout the world, and it declares what we as individuals, and our governments, shall strive for in the modern world. Let's take a look at Article 23 of the UDHR shall we?:(1) Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.(2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.(3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.(4) Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.Well, it seems that \"Everyone has the right to work\". :-DRyan is obviously full of [it]. The right to a job and economic security *ARE* in fact basic human rights, as is the right to organize in unions.Now, let's look at Article 25...:(1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.(2) Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection.Man, Ryan's probably boiling while reading this. ...but I bet he'd kill or mame to protect this one:Article 17:(1) Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others.Yep, those others are all [garbage], but this one is right on. Nobody better touch my stuff!...I read the book I laughed. I read these spastic sputtering reviews, I laughed again. Do the same!Josh",

I was doing just fine with the book, laughing a lot, being provoked here and there and mildly offended now and then until I read Chapter 10. This is the chapter where Moore puts Hitler's anti-semitic views to shame by declaring that Germany is a nation that has not paid for it's sins and that all of it's citizens, regardless of age or lack of complicity, deserve being gunned down in the streets. He calls German retirees and tourists in Florida \"Nazis\" and thinks it would be humorous to arm South Floridians and have them \"REALLY\" end WWIIsaying \"Run for your life Klaus!\"Sorry Michael...you crossed the line.Buy the book and keep it on your shelf as an example of how at some point the Left can stretch so far that it touches fingers with the Right.",

A die-hard supporter of Nader and the Green party, Moore is most well known for TV Nation and the indie movie \"Roger and Me.\"In \"Downsize This,\" Moore takes on the both Democrats and Republicans in hilarious essays that will make you laugh while you growing angry. He also takes on that bane of Democracy: Large, rich corporations.The best essay in the book is \"Would Pat Buchanan Take a Check From Satan?\" In it, Moore takes an old political trick from Buchanan's days with Nixon and uses it against Mr. Buchanan. According to Moore, Buchanan cashed checks from \"The John Wayne Gacy Fan Club,\" (famous serial killer) and \"Abortionists for Buchanan.\" Pat still hasn't cashed the Satan one yet.Look for Moore's new book - \"Stupid White Men....\" It was nearly banned and destroyed because he dared criticize the President.",

Michael Moore is a brilliant satirist. This book owns a place on my classroom desk, and I often cite passages from DOWNSIZE THIS! to support my ramblings about the current state of the American political ecomony. I especially enjoy using his chapter on corporate criminals where I get a chance to point directly at students (who are wise enough by then to know they are supposed to agree with their instrcutor's positions which are routinely in sympathy with Mr. Moore's) who are using products produced by these &quot;criminals.&quot; Mr. Moore's ravings about NAFTA may be growing old in some parts of this nation, but not at my school--rural and Latino--that is less than a mile from one of the &quot;NAFTA HIGHWAYS.&quot; I treasure the memory of the day when a state senator came to speak to my class and found himself peppered with questions drawn from material in this book. I recommend DOWNSIZE THIS! highly, as I do Michael Moore's films ROGER AND ME, CANADIAN BACON, and THE BIG ONE as well as the video sets of episodes originally produced for his two television shows. I only wish he'd collect more of TV NATION onto video. I would love to use his Canada episode, his segment on Avon sales in Latin America, and the Coke/Pepsi rivalry in a Mexican village piece in my classroom. Great works all!",

But I have to say, this man can communicate his point. His antics and his rants are all well read and educated when it comes to the issues in which he speaks. There is nothing this man won't do to make his point.Michael Moore, the man who brought us \"Roger and Me,\" brings to this book a passion for the American Citizen and the American worker that is second to none. His ideas are a bit extreme, but he really hits home with the points. From calling Nelson Mandela to end the \"American Apartheid\" brought forth by the fact that racism is still a major problem here, to sending campaign contribution checks to Pat Buchanan from the \"Abortionists for Buchanan\" PAC to prove that no matter who gives money to politicians, and no matter how much a politician says that they are against what the PAC stands for, they will take the money (Pictures of the checks and the endorsements are all pictured in the book)Overall this book is about the general abuse the American worker has endured as a result of Corporate America, and its never-ending pursuit of the dollar. He makes constant reference to a multitude of American companies that announce enormous profits and then layoff considerable numbers of workers. He denounces the concept of corporate welfare as it amounts to three times the value of all social welfare programs combined.I guess what I didn't like about the book was the extreme stances. The book definitely had some socialist overtones. I don't have a problem with the concepts but I do not always like how much the means will cost for the ends. . . .Overall, this is a good book. If you do not have a left-swinging bone in your body, do not bother with this book unless you are checking up on what the opposition thinks. You will be offended.

Moore exposes the corporate crimes and hypocrisy that take place in this country, but is by no means against Corporations in general or the virtues of making a profit. He just feels that corporations have gotten completely unreasonable by firing thousands of employees while profits are at a peak and leaving cities after receiving tax breaks as an incentive for staying.The picture of the Federal building bombed in Oklahoma City is placed next to the picture of a condemned factory in Flint, Michigan after GM pulled out. The pictures are nearly identical and the imagery is extremely powerful. What exactly is terrorism, Moore asks?Many will disagree with Moore's opinions and some will be offended by certain things in this book, especially the chapter dealing with the L.A. Riots and the O.J. Simpson case. However, I do think it's worth a read, even if you disagree, if only to reinforce your views.",

In the political spectrum, he is a liberal, but he is not quick to judge like other documents written by liberals and conservatives alike. Instead, he obviously does a ton of research and observes the patterns of politics and big business. He manages to pojnt out the shocking similarities between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, and denounces both of them as alike, and givespretty good reasons on why half the population doesn't take part in presidential elections. His views on abortion, though comical in some sense, surprisingly make a lot of senseAlong with a satirical sense of honesty, Moore also throws in some very humorous commentary, like new and improved ways to vote for the President, and several jabs at certain politicians and corporations, especially a certain corporation he attacked in his documentary Roger and Me.To read this book, an open mind is recommended. Moore's sharp wit and sense of being accurate, in most cases, may be too much for some to handle.

He connects corporate greed to racism and corrupt politicians. His piece on congressman Robert Dornan is just superb! For me as a European this open corruption and greed in politicians in the USA is strange. Of course our politicians also lie and are corrupt, but they are a bit more discrete about it.

He starts out by giving a list of guidelines to use, that he compiled from different memos, when downsizing a company. He did a great job at putting the list together, it's funny, but at the same time, you know that what he is saying is true. His ability to write about serious issues goes throughout the whole book. Moore has this in-your-face attitude that makes him everybody's hero. He talks about the issues that really matter to the majority of Americans, and tells the side of the story that we never hear about. Like when he talks about terrorism. He first states what we all know and pretty much agree on, that when people purposely do something to destroy other people's lives, like blow up a building, that's terrorism. But then he brings up a point that is never talked about, or heard on the news. Like, why isn't it that when a company closes a plant, and thousands of people lose their jobs, and are barely able to survive, why isn't that called terrorism? A lot of people who do have that happen to them turn to alcohol and/or drugs, which will kill them too. Crime rates go up, and so does the murder rate. So people's lives are still be destroyed, but just by large corporations instead of a group a people. This is just one example of how Moore can totally mix things up, and give a whole different perspective on all sorts of issues.

Moore the documentarian goes to work explaining how corporate welfare works, how what the average multimillionare celebrity spends his day, and in the most amazing chapter how political bigwig Bob Dornan is absolutely freakin' nuts (yes, Dornan is the guy who rallied against abortion but took his own wife to get one - and that isn't even the tip of the iceburg on this guy's irrationality and egotism and, well, nuttiness.) 5.

He is both pro-culture and pro-heritage, but he stands against the idea that cultural identity means a seperation of the American People. Taking on a myriad of topics, Schlesinger explains with great simplicity, straight-forwardness, and honesty how multi-culturalism can be taken too far, taken to absurd conclusions. Essentially, Schlesinger is letting us know that not everything is best when it is presented through the eyes of multi-culturalism.I read the book in a single sitting. Once I started to read, I was drawn in more and more. Even if you don't agree with his premise, Schlesinger writes in such a way that there is no ambiguity to what he is saying. Knowing Schlesinger's politics for some may make this all the more shocking, but I have to ask those who oppose the message of this book whether they are upset that he is saying these things in general, or if they are upset because a &quot;liberal&quot; is saying these things.In my opinion this book is of critical importance to understand the second half of the 20th century in America.",

Even lynching of Blacks was not illegal until Truman made it so in 1948 and images of fire hose and German Shepard attacks on peaceful Black protestors or their White supporters remains a stark memory. His book, however, is an alert to those of reason regardless of affiliation that the movement has run off its tracks. But that hasn't stopped its wreckage from continuing to plow a path of ruin through its original intent. As Schlesinger puts it, \"A culture of ethnicity has arisen to denounce the idea of a melting pot, to protect and perpetuate separate ethnic and racial communities.\" Its underlying philosophy is that America is not a nation of individuals but a nation of groups, he says; ethnicity is the defining experience; division into ethnic communities establishes the structure of American society and the fundamental meaning of American history. \"Multiethnic dogma abandons historic purposes, replacing assimilation by fragmentation, integration by separation.\" Our modern movements succeed where the Klan failed.Referencing multiculturalism he asks if it is the school's function to teach racial pride? When does obsession with difference threaten identity? Since this 1993 book this obsession has become an educational standard. Our calendar is split into months for one race pride or another (except white and European). It starts early - believing the purpose of history is therapeutic. He notes, \"Once ethnic pride and self-esteem become the criterion for teaching history then certain things cannot be taught.\" Schlesinger asks the question, \"Why does anyone suppose that pride and inspiration are available only from people of the same ethnicity?\" One wonders.Schlesinger's core warning is the same as that of the Founders, that \"the virus of tribalism lies dormant, flaring up to destroy entire nations.\" But that has not stopped the derailment of Civil Rights. As Schlesinger notes, Black America's valid leaders - like so much from the Left that began for the right reasons - have been hijacked for the benefits of opposition, not unification.",

Arguably, the most important aspect of the melting pot vision is the governmental and legal system of the United States. Modern liberals and various interest groups are trying to change this presently (which is their right, of course), but disturbingly trying to also rewrite its history. For instance, as Schlesinger writes, the New York State curriculum has mandated that study of the American Founding include reference to the &quot;Haudenosaunee political system&quot; -- in effect, the Iroquois Confederation. Schlesinger correctly notes that this &quot;influence&quot; on the Constitution's Framers was &quot;marginal,&quot; and on European intellectuals it was non-existent. (After all, wasn't it virtually only Ben Franklin's quote, after visiting the Iroquois, that said essentially, &quot;If they can do [create a confederation], why can't we?&quot;) But, no other state has as effective an Iroquois lobby as New York.",

Common to both is the author's persistent ideological clinging to the quaint notion that the United States is something Special, a blessed land suspended above the hue and cry of foreign nations with their ethnic wars and endless conflicts, still Cotton Mather's shining city on a hill, and not just another place where flawed human beings happen to live, with as much to learn from others as Americans may have to teach, and just as entitled to self-defense and self-preservation as any other people.It is shocking, if pleasant, to hear an unrepentant Kennedy liberal who was the official historian of John F. Kennedy's administration, finally come to grips with facts that more clear-sighted observers had noticed years earlier, and publicly embrace the formerly universally scorned \"right-wing racist\" opinion that unlimited multiculturalism with its illogical presumption that the more ethnic diversity in any society the more stable it will be, may not be wise or justified by the experience of millennia of history. Gee, do ya really think so, Arthur? Three and a half centuries after the first blacks were imported into the U.S., Los Angeles had a full-blown race riot--a city without the slightest hint of racism, or history of slavery, ground zero for social liberalism in the U.S. Forty years after the \"strictly temporary\" solution of affirmative action for blacks, the system of official preferences has become not only permanent for blacks, but has spread to virtually every other conceivable ethnic group, even billionaire Saudis, and has no sign of weakening or retreating. If only other liberals had similarly corrected their spectacles before the Disaster of 9/11 struck, condemning a generation of Americans to perpetual war, grinding taxes to pay for it, and economic turmoil, and inducing the powers-that-be to throw what little remained of the Constitution after Justices Brennan and Black trampled it in the dust during the Era of Liberalism, into the trash can.Schlesinger, however, did not jettison his starry-eyed obsession with American uniqueness entirely, a flaw that admittedly afflicts the Right as well as the Left in this country, always ready to launch into yet another ill-thought overseas crusade. While recognizing the silliness of Ethnic Studies with its fanciful insistence that the Egyptian pharaohs were \"black\" in the sense that people of Zaire or Zimbabwe are \"black,\" he entirely fails to recognize that the political phenomenon of Gender Studies relies on precisely the same absurdities and power-plays and is equally responsible for the abysmal decline in the quality and international reputation of academic social sciences in America, but, what's worse, he strangely refuses to face the implication of his own analysis: that if fragmented ethnicity per se is a potential time-bomb for the stability of a society if given insufficient time to absorb the newcomers, then the political beliefs and alien cultures of incoming masses of immigrants may prove utterly incompatible with the most cherished values of native Americans who may, after all, have more than a passing interest in preserving such values as the ballot-box, the peaceful transfer of political power, and separation of church and state.The legal struggle over the implementation of Sharia law, with its amputations and death by stoning and rigorous segregation of the sexes in public areas, has joined battle in America's courts as the number of traditionalist Muslims has reached critical mass sufficient to demand legal recognition of their values. Mexicans fly the Mexican flag at Cinco de Mayo parades, scorn the border, and refer to the American Southwest as Mexico Occupado. Indian-Americans (from India), even those born and bred in the U.S., publish calls for affirmative action on the basis of their ethnicity in college newspapers. Shiites build $50 million shrines and community centers and openly declare their readiness to strike the U.S. with thousands of suicide bombers from within its borders in the event of conflict with Iran. Indians (from domestic tribes) demand compensation and apologies after 400 years of co-existence with the U.S., instead of gratitude for learning the arts of civilization, or offering their own apologies for centuries of torture and massacres of innocents, inflicted on both settlers and other Indian tribes.In the past twenty-five years, 100 million people immigrated to the United States. The next 15-20 years will see another 100 million arrive; and another decade or so will likely witness yet another 100 million. With over a billion people in each country, China and India could each send 200 million people to the U.S. overnight without even noticing the difference. Of this enormous influx, virtually all come from societies that differ profoundly from the U.S., and a great majority from countries that have no experience whatsoever with democracy or human rights as Americans know them. This immigration will not only crush the environment in this country and deplete what remains of its resources, but, given the corrupt gridlock in Washington, has the potential of paralyzing the body politic and preventing a majority from emerging on any conceivable topic, including perhaps the preference of ballots over bullets. On the day of 9/11, Washington temporarily suspended the Constitution. If the political conflicts implicit in unrestricted immigration and infinite ethnic diversity become endemic, you can perhaps kiss the Constitution, and the ballot-box, goodbye. Schlesinger petulantly addressed only the disintegration of America's colleges and the rise of incivility among professors and students, as if that's news to anyone who's been in a social science classroom since 1970. Had he bothered to look beyond his books, he would long ago have seen coming in the distance droves of domestically-produced car-bombs and suicide-bombers.",

                "review/text": "I'll admit upfront...I haven't reread this in several years. But I remember the text 's main arguments as if it were last month. Nothing in the ensuing years has undercut Mr Sclesinger's main argument, and much has substantiated it. In fact...one has only to look at the recent riots in France to see that it isn't even a distinctly American phenomenon.Immigrants now, no matter where they come from, and where they end up, seem not to leave their country of origin with any real desire to assimilate...only to live better with the least amount of cultural conciliation possible.The main flaw in this book, looking backwards, is that he doesn't delve deeply enough into the real economic drivers of immigration today in his search for the reason why. As I remember, Schlesinger places the blame, if that's the correct term, upon a shift in immigration policies by the U.S. that favors family reunification (as well as a prevailing atmosphere of political correctness) The PC argument is the weakest line of argument., in my mind.The real culprit in this very true depiction of balkinization within American (and Wester European) society, is the capitalist need for ever more sources of fresh, unskilled, undemanding, easily exploited labor, which will work for substantially less than the going rate and not ask for more, nor question the terms or conditions under which it is employed. By definition, this is an immigrant workforce.That it is slow to \"assimilate\" is not hard to comprehend. It doesn't have to. Today's economic structure make's sure that such a transistion is both smooth and many years off into the future, More to the point, the economic forces which benefit from this class of immigrants have shown themselves very adept at passing along the costs of their captive workforce to society at large...in terms of prolonged bilingual education, public education in general for non-citizens, taxpayer subsidized health care for uninsured, undocumented workers, and lower prevailing wages,I'm a died in the wool liberal...and many liberals took issue with this book. Too bad, really...but as the saying goes...the truth hurts. Read this book. Think about the bilingual education political fracus which shook California a decade and a half ago. This book speaks to that.I was a Peace Corps Volunteer, not that anyone cares...but just to buttress my liberal credentials. I left the U.S. with one college semester of Spanish, and within three months I was conversant. How many of you know of someone who has lived here in the U.S. for more than a decade and can still hardly communicate in English?That's what this book is about, on one level. The level in which prevailing economic forces prefer it that way is less explored, unfortunately. We no longer ask that you subscribe to the American dream...only that you accept a job at the Tyson chicken processing plant, and not make a fuss over either the wages nor the unsafe working conditions. If you can do that, plave your hand on this Bible and recite the oathe of allegiance the the United States of America....and be prepared for two political parties vying tooth and nail for your vote in the upcoming election.",

The author debunks much of the hyper-multicultural political correctness that plagued our universities for much of the early 1990's (It has since subsided since its initial outbreak, but remains a constant problem), but makes his point without sounding reactionary or afraid of change. Instead, he assiduously disseminates the separtist anti-American sentiments of radical multiculturalism while reminding americans of the value of a cultural pluralistic society that honors the traditions and cultures of our ancestors while not forgetting the common bonds of Americanism that unite us all. To that point, he reminds the reader what Americanism truley is; it is not a homogenenous white monoculture that looks and acts like a bad 1950's sitcom. Rather, Americanism is expressed in the democratic values that have allowed all groups to participate in civic life.His book is a seminal work, important for all, especially whites, such as myself, whose culture has defined the dominant culture in America for 200 years. Change and inclusion are good things. The road to a united America falls on both the natives to accept newcomers and the newcomers to accept the democratic American principles and not form antagonistic enclaves separate from the whole.",

                "review/text": "While this book was not as compelling as I expected it to be, I completely agree with the general premise. That being that multi-culturalism taken too far is both harmful and counter-productive. Not to mention that it is completely antithetical to what our founders envisioned for this country. Mr. Schlesinger has nothing against the teaching of cultures other than European-American, but he insists that an over-emphasis on ethnicity, ultimately promotes division and an 'us vs. them' mentality. Multi-culturalists argue that it is important for students to be taught about their own respective ethnicity in order to have self-esteem and pride. Mr. Schlesinger argues, and I firmly agree, that as Americans, we no longer belong to the ethnicities of our grandfathers. Our founding fathers were clear about this, Americans are a \"new race of men\" who must \"cast off the European skin, never to resume it.\" Indeed, America was meant to be a melting pot. Schlesinger acknowledges that throughout much of our history, many minorities were forcibly excluded from fully assimilating. This is no longer the case though, and I think it is important to point out that just because a man (or a nation) fails to live up to it's ideals, does not mean that the ideals are wrong. Included in the book are quotes from various Americans about this issue, and I was somewhat surprised by some of them. For instance, the great Frederick Douglas said, \"No one idea has given rise to more opression and persecution toward the colored people of this country, than that which makes Africa, not America, their home. It is that wolfish idea that elbows us off the sidewalk, and denies us the rights of citizenship.\"I firmly believe that this tribalist mentality is one of the foremost issues facing America today. We will not survive as a nation if we continue to separate ourselves along lines of race, ethnicity, or religion. As long as we view ourselves as Irish-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, or African-Americans, we will never be true Americans. And we will not view each other as fellow Americans, but as separate tribes that need to be guarded against. Is this the America that our founding fathers would have wanted?As I stated earlier, I didn't find the book as compelling as I expected. Not that it's not good, but I felt the author could have gone further. All in all, it is a decent starting point for anyone interested in the subject of multi-culturalism.",

                "review/text": "The fact that this book is out of print should be seen as a black mark against the conscience -- or lack thereof -- of American society. It indicates that we Americans are again suffering from a sense of collective amnesia; that we have willfully chosen to forget a shameful event in our history: the prison uprising at Attica prison in upstate New York that ended with the undeserved deaths of more than two dozen inmates in 1971.Wicker, a fine journalist who was at the time of the revolt an editorial writer with the New York Times, was one of a group of outsiders summoned to the prison by inmate spokesmen to observe negotiations between the inmates and prison authorities. &quot;A Time to Die&quot; is a detailed account of what he saw during the several-day standoff as he and his colleagues struggled to piece together a settlement that would avoid shedding the blood of the revolting inmates and of the prison guards the inmates had taken hostage during the insurrection.Wicker's analysis lays bare the conditions at Attica that led to the uprising. Dietary and sanitary conditions were far less than adequate; guards were poorly trained and particularly ill-equipped to deal with large numbers of African-American and Latino prisoners; attempts to rehabilitate prisoners or to prepare them for productive life outside the walls of the prison were woefully inadequate; and the labor of the prisoners was exploited for the benefit of the small town in which the institution resided.The blueprint for a tragic ending was mapped early in the violent revolt that sent hundreds of inmates into the prison's D Yard, where they set up an informal society. One of the prison guards was badly injured and died shortly thereafter. From that point on, the inmates' demand for amnesty and for redress of their many grievances met a wall of resistance from prison authorities and ultimately from the governor of New York, Nelson Rockefeller.A measure of Wicker's sympathy clearly lies with the inmates, but he is fair in illuminating the problems facing authorities as well. They were under enormous -- and understandable -- pressure from the families of hostages and from society at large, which demanded a get-tough stance against criminals whose demands for rights outraged a weary post-'60s society ready for a return to &quot;law and order,&quot; as the president of the day, Richard Nixon, had called for.In the end, after many desperate efforts by Wicker and the other observers at compromise, Rockefeller gave into those demands and ordered a full-scale assault on the captured prison yard. Although the inmates were armed with nothing more than crude weapons, 29 were killed and dozens more were seriously injured. Although the State claimed initially that wounds suffered by the hostages were inflicted by the prisoners, subsequent investigations proved otherwise.Most shameful was the post-pacification treatment of the prisoners who survived the attack. They were stripped, made to run a gauntlet of officers who took turns striking them, and several of the uprising's leaders were beaten and tortured in reprisal for their role in the revolt.The book's title comes from the sorrowful observation of one of Wicker's colleagues. After the carnage, Wicker heard the man lament, &quot;I don't know what the hurry was. There is always time to die.&quot;&quot;A Time to Die&quot; is required reading for students of American social history. If it had gone out of print because the abuses that led to Attica were no more, then we as a society should have no complaint. This, of course, is untrue. The conditions that led to the Attica revolt and the abuse of power that settled it should be considered soberly with an eye toward redress. Reading this book is a good place to start that process.",

                "review/text": "I looked forward to reading this book because it was cited in so many of my Justice Administration courses in college. Unfortunately, I found the author more concerned with stroking his own ego than simply relating the story. Unlike other reporter/authors, such as Robert Fisk in \"Pity the Nation,\" Wicker does not stick to the reporter role and just tell the story. Instead, he forces you to read his nutshell autobiography as well. This would perhaps be more tolerable if he had written the book from the first person perspective, but instead he always refers to himself in the third person. Tom Wicker thought this, Wicker did that.I don't know if he thought this style would add more weight and the atmosphere of impartiality, but it comes across as arrogant and condescending, much like a royal \"We.\" At first I thought perhaps he did it so as he would not be the central character in his own book, but as you progress it is evident that he is very much front and center in the story. Wicker laments his lack of acclaim as an author and his inability to produce a popular novel seems to have found an outlet in this book. By interweaving his own biography, he is able to force people, who would otherwise have never read it, to learn of the glory that is Tom Wicker.The story of the prison riot itself, and the characters involved, is just as interesting as I'd hoped it would be. The portrayals of the people involved seem honest and balanced. Seeing things from Wicker's point of view, as opposed to the omniscient historian looking back in time, also makes this book worth reading. Wicker's reporting remains top notch, providing all the relevant detail in an easy and concise format.In short, if Wicker had stuck to reporting, which he does very well, and not used this as an outlet for this desire to be a popular author, the book would have been both significantly shorter and significantly better.",

                "review/text": "A Time to Die by Tom Wicker is one of the most important accounts and, perhaps, the most comprehensive account available on the inmate uprising and takeover of the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York in 1971. Wicker was asked by the protesting inmates in control of the prison's D-yard to be one of the outside observers who would visit the prisoners, check on the condition and treatment of the hostages held in D-yard as well as inmates in other parts of the facility not controlled by the prisoners, and help negotiate terms of prison reform between the prisoners and prison authorities. Wicker was a New York Times columnist who often wrote on the subject of prisoner's rights and wrote several sympathetic articles on George Jackson, a San Quentin inmate who many non-white prisoners regarded as a freedom fighter, after he was killed by prison guards for allegedly hiding a weapon in his Afro earlier that year. The Attica inmates saw Wicker as a respected journalist on their side and invited him among others to visit the prison.Wicker is a self-professed \"limousine liberal\" and definitely wrote this book with a pro-prisoner perspective. The ideals of the Civil Rights Movement were still very fresh and many of the inmate's 15 \"practical proposals\" (more African American and Puerto Rican prison guards to reflect the racial make-up among the prison population, religious freedom, improved meals with less pork which many inmates did not wish to eat for religious reasons, better medical care, etc) seemed very reasonable. Wicker, however, is no radical. He was concerned when potential firebrands like lawyer William Kunstler (who defended the Chicago 7), Muslim activist Jaybarr Kenyatta, and Black Panther Bobby Seale joined the observers, although he later criticized Seale for showing a lack of interest and abandoning the cause. As a journalist, Wicker also showed a realistic understanding of what the authorities and society would accept. Minimum wages for all state institutions he knew was probably not a realistic goal. The inmates five \"demands\" also, according to Wicker, posed a problem to a peaceful settlement; especially the first 2. The inmates were uncompromising in their demands for complete amnesty from \"physical, mental and legal reprisals\" and for transportation \"to a non-imperialist country.\" Wicker knew these demands could never be met, especially after a prison guard died from head trauma suffered during the initial takeover. Wicker described his experience in the prison and the different people he met at D-yard, both leaders and non-leaders of the rebellion, as well as prisoners in C-block who were not able to take part in the uprising and a few of whom did not support it. He was most concerned, however, about the ample supply of weapons for the state troopers surrounding the prison. With all the weapons in hand, Wicker concluded that the ultimate question was \"Why not use them?\": this observation proved to be prophetic.At some points in the book, the story switches to a biography. Wicker is white and grew up in North Carolina. He often interrupts his observations of Attica to reflect on his background in race relations. Some of these flash backs are appropriate for understanding the context of race relations at Attica (i.e. black inmate v. white prison guard); however, sometimes Wicker relates too much on his own insecurities as a writer and his unfulfilled ambitions to succeed in great literature. Such personal information is distracting and not relevant to the subject matter except insofar as he may have taken his role as observer very seriously because he wanted to participate in something very important in human relations. Still, some of this self criticism seems more therapeutic to the author than useful to the reader's understanding of Attica and probably should have been edited out of the book. Wicker also refers to himself in the third person, which is rather odd.Wicker follows the story of Attica to the violent end as well as the false reports of inmate abuse and mutilation of hostages in the aftermath. The violence only makes up the final chapter is not described in as much detail as Wicker did not observe the event. There is also some information on what happened to the prison and some of the central players in the negotiations after the stand-off. New York governor Nelson Rockefeller, who Wicker is critical of for choosing not to visit the prison during the negotiations, will, of course, become Vice President under Gerald Ford (the only U.S. President and VP not voted in by the American people). The book includes appendixes of the 5 prisoner demands, 15 practical proposals, list of observers, and the 28 reform points by State Correction Commissioner Russell Oswald (not supported by the observers or inmates). Two sets of b&w; write photos are included. Because the book was released only a few years after the event, there is no long term perspective, although the reader is left with the impression that not too much has changed at Attica.",

All of the gory details of the lynchings are given including why the victim was lynched, how the victim was tortured before the lynching and the method used for execution.Here are some examples of a few headlines to give you an idea of the content:&quot;First Negro at West Point Knifed by Fellow Cadets&quot; &quot;Texans Lynch Wrong Negro&quot; &quot;Lynched for Being Black&quot; &quot;Wrong Man Lynched as Rapist&quot; &quot;Negro Youth Mutilated for Kissing White Girl&quot; &quot;Negro Shot Dead for Kissing his White Girlfriend&quot; The redeeming value in a book like this is that it's a study of human behavior. It shows how far people can and will go in the name of hate and what kinds of things people are capable of.",

Ginzburg's book makes the job easier by providing the instructor with primary documents with which to examine the phenomenon. In particular, Ginzburg's collection is useful because it draws upon newspaper articles intended for a number of constituencies. Some, directed at racist whites, cheer the lynchings. Meanwhile, black newspapers and those directed at more progressive whites decry the practice. As such, the collection is a perfect tool for examing the place of lynching within various US communities in the latter 19th and early 20th century. Even more excellent when combined with the visual record of _No Sanctuary_.",

Shame, embarrassment and denial have kept this common practice (estimates range from 6,000 to 100,000 Black victims) swept under America's rug, and left out of America's classrooms. So ashamed are White Americans, that any mention of other reference materials on this subject, usually result in censorship (even by Amazon). I used this book, along with several others that I won't bother mentioning (because Amazon won't print the titles, even though they'll sell them), to write my book White Men Can't Hump (As Good As Black Men), also available on Amazon. The detailed info in 100 Years of Lynching helped me address the Racial and Sexual stereotypes that have long plagued our society. These stereotypes have a profound impact on how Whites and Blacks perceive, and therefore, treat each other. Lynching, castration, Jim Crow laws, and anti-Miscegenation laws, all emanated from White Male fear of the Black Pen*s. How else can you explain such heinous behavior, and heinous legislation. This behavior had nothing to do with Race-Mixing, because Race-Mixing has always been quite alright in America (as long as it's a White Pen*s doing the mixing, a la Stromm Thurmond). This book is one of the cornerstones of my book's basic premise, so therefore, I obviously cherish it, and highly recommend it. It reminds me of Jack Nicholson's comment in the movie \"A Few Good Men\": You want the truth! You want the truth! You CAN'T handle the truth! America says that it wants the truth to our Racial divide, but by sweeping the practice of Lynching under the rug, America obviously CAN'T handle the truth.Peace",

He criticizes Americans for criticizing America and Americans for being sympathetic to our enemies. Maybe someone should have tapped his shoulder and told him that he was doing exactly the same thing--criticizing Americans.Goldberg makes it clear that his list is his opinions. This is an important caveat because if challenged he needs offer no evidence or proof to confirm his judgment. Often, he projects and assumes recklessly e.g. liberals are more interested in the rights of terrorists than Americans. This is shrewd strategy though. It is impossible to respond to such a \"broad brush\" attack without sounding like a moron.He adds incredible names to his list e.g. Bill Moyers whose name is legendary in journalism, having garnered thirty journalistic awards in as many years. This smacks of a Pee Wee player criticizing a major league Hall-of-Famer. It has a hollow ring. But Moyers can hold his own. Goldberg's real low point was adding Courtney Love to the list and describing her in one word, Ho. It's difficult for me to look at this \"author\" as a gentleman or even as a man when he publicly calls a woman a whore.

This would be bad enough however Mr. Singer says that you can kill a baby up to a month old that shows signs of weakness or frailty he equates this to returning a car that turned out to be a lemon.On behalf of disabled people everywhere Mr. Singer thanks very much its always good to feel loved and cared for which I always thought was the true mark of an enlightened society.Now I have issues with the book four of them actually Rodney King, Jesse Jackson and Michel Moore way too predictable.

He knew he needed to lose weight fast, but he had run out of diets - all had failed. After doing some reading on evolution (why weren't our forebears fat?), David cut sugar - specifically fructose - from his diet. He immediately started to lose weight, and kept it off. Slim, trim and fired up, David set out to look at the connection between sugar, our soaring obesity rates and some of the more worrying diseases of the twenty-first century, and discovered some startling facts in the process. Sugar was once such a rare resource that nature decided we didn't need an off-switch - in other words, we can keep eating sugar without feeling full. In the space of 150 years, we have gone from eating no added sugar to more than a kilogram a week. You would need to run 7km every day of your life just to not put on weight as a result of eating that much sugar. Two decades ago 1 in 14 adult Australians were obese; that figure is now 1 in 5. The 'natural' sugar in one glass of unsweetened fruit juice per day for a year is enough to add just over 2.5kg your waistline. The more sugar we eat, the more we want. Food manufacturers exploit our sugar addiction by lacing it through 'non-sweet' products, such as bread, sauces, soups and cereals. Sweet Poison exposes one of the great health scourges of our time and offers a wealth of practical and accessible information on how to avoid fructose, increase your enjoyment of food and lose weight.",

The author's case study of how she traced her case of Graves' disease to aspartame toxicity makes for interesting reading. However, her description of the biochemistry and neuroscience involved in the effects of aspartame is full of inaccuracies. For instance, she states that the &quot;methanol component&quot; of aspartame binds the two amino acids (phenylalanine and aspartic acid) together. This is simply false; in fact, aspartame is composed of a phenylalanine residue bonded to an aspartic acid residue via a peptide bond identical to what you find in proteins; the phenylalanine residue is modified by the addition of a methyl group on its C-terminus (so COOH becomes COOCH3). Methanol is not a &quot;part&quot; of aspartame, but is formed when aspartame is digested. The author's description of the blood-brain barrier &quot;squeezing out toxins&quot; is particularly absurd. I wish she had asked a biochemist to proofread the book, because the mistakes weaken her credibility substantially.

Barlett and James B. Steele .Another \"thing that makes you go hmmm\" is the fact that the company that developed and sells aspartame as a sweetener once had Donald Rumsfeld as it's president.That's right - that Donald Rumsfeld.Ties to government and corporate revolving doors need not be explained here.HOWEVER...After reading the first half of this book, I can't follow her logic.In one paragraph she writes about a little girl who's \"left side was totally paralyzed.\" Two paragraphs later the same little girl \"sat up in her bed, arms extended\". Does not compute...First she disputes a doctor's diagnosis of Graves disease because she only has 13 of the 14 symptoms. The one symptom that she doesn't have is weight loss. Indeed, as is pointed out over and over again - she's gained weight, so she disputes the diagnosis of Grave's disease.The next thing she writes about is how she's trying to find the cause of her Grave's disease - why all of a sudden does she believe the doctor's diagnosis?Then she proceeds to convince herself that the cause of her illness (Grave's disease or not) is aspartame.The author then claims that it's her duty to \"warn (the public) of the dangers of aspartame.\" While looking for advice on how to start a lecturing/speaking career, she just so happens to stumble upon a publicist who \"coincidently\" and apparently in her spare time has founded the Aspartame Consumer Safety Network.When you're a hammer - everything looks like a nail.Why do I need to know the color of her doctor's goatee? Why do I need to know what she wears when she's doing her \"research\"? What about all of the cheesy dialogue? This reads like a bad screenplay. She pats herself on the back for standing up to these evil ignorant doctors. This is an obvious play to the fans of Erin Brokovich - or is it the fans of Julia Roberts?This woman sees a need to deal \"with the disenchantment of my marriage.\" However, as she writes - \"I'll worry about it later. For now, I want to concentrate on doing something about aspartame.\"SAY WHA?Sorry, but this thing reads like either 1) The bad diary of a slightly depressed hypocondriac, or 2) a book by a woman who has been used by others (who have their own agendas to push).It's probably both.",

What is important, is that she is right. I know. I've been there.About four years ago, my mother told me that she saw a segment on the news about the adverse effects of aspartame (weight gain, headaches, hair loss, etc.) and told me because she knew that I drank diet drinks. At that point, I was drinking one can of Diet Coke, Monday through Friday, in the afternoon at work because that was what was available. At home, I was drinking Diet Rite which uses Splenda. I was not using any other diet products and still don't. So, I thought it was no big deal to just drink the regular Coke with sugar for a week to see if I noticed any difference.At that point, my feet were in such increasing pain from \"arthritis,\" I felt I was fast on my way to using a wheelchair. The condition had gotten increasing worse for more than ten years. I came home one Friday night and was not even sure I could walk the few feet to the bathroom. I had spent a fortune on extremely expensive doctors, shoes, inserts, etc.Within four days of not drinking aspartame, I was able to walk up and down stairs for the first time in many years. About 90 percent of the pain was gone. The balance of the pain went away over a period of months, and today (even though I am four years older), I am in no pain at all, and take a great deal of delight in buying really cheap shoes.My brother-in-law gets migranes from aspartame (obviously, he is not genetically-related to me). My mother has had two cans of diet drinks in her life; the first sent her to bed with a severe headache, and the second one made her feel like she was high on drugs. None of the three of us ever talked about it until after my dramatic experience. That's not coincidence.Mind you I was drinking five cans a week. People that are drinking a lot more and not making the connection (as I didn't) are being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, lupus, etc. This is not a small cost to what we laughingly call our \"health care system.\" We are all paying big time for this in cold hard cash not to mention the loss of productive workers.Aspartame is a neuro-toxin. In retrospect, it makes absolute sense that I had such pain in my feet because there are so many nerve endings in the feet. It was developed by G. D. Searle in Skokie, Illinois (which was bought out by Monsanto). The CEO of G.D. Searle who pushed aspartame through the FDA was Donald Rumsfeld after Reagan became President. He was adamant about getting this approved despite the fact that the animal studies that Searle did killed some of the monkeys. This is a fact, not as one reviewer stated, in the same category as belief in UFO's.Given the recent revelelations about the FDA, can anyone seriously think that they are protecting us? They are bought and sold by the drug companies. Period. As individuals, we cannot take anything that they say seriously. We have to do as much homework as we can and keep ourselves as healthy as we can.There is no excuse for this product being in our food supply in any way, shape, or form. It is completely unnecessary (we're talking about diet products). It is presently in more than 8000 products, no-sugar candy, no-sugar gum, no-sugar yogurt, Crystal Lite, sugar-free Kool-Aid, etc. Please read the labels! And, please, please, don't give these products to children! This is also especially cruel to diabetics who have no idea that other health issues are being caused by the very products that they are using to control their sugar intake.I presently drink Diet Rite which uses Splenda, and Coke and Pepsi are both introducing drinks with Splenda this year after pooh-poohing decades of complaints, although apparently being on a slow-learning curve, Coke is introducing a drink using aspartame and Splenda. Duh. Diet Rite, by the way, until this month was owned by a British company (not American) Cadbury Schwepps.Don't believe me, and don't believe the skeptics. Do what I did, go without aspartame for a week and see if you see any difference and believe your own reactions. I had no idea in the world that the excruciating pain in my feet had any connection at all to diet drinks and was stunned and thrilled by the dramatic difference. By the way, I think my hair is a little thicker, and I am much less prone to depression. Don't try aspartame, you'll like it.You go, Janet!",

Rather than suffering from Graves' Disease, a deadly thyroid disease, Hull had been poisoned by the food and soft drinks she had consumed.A working mother with little time, Hull relied on prepared foods. She counted on diet drinks to help control her weight. She didn't realize how much aspartame (Nutrasweet) she was consuming, and she didn't know until almost too late that it was toxic to her system. After her recovery, she devoted her spare time to researching the history of aspartame in food products. Her book is the result of those years of research.She &quot;uncovered hundreds of documents contradicting the NutraSweet Company's claim of product safety.&quot; She quotes statistics from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) indicating that &quot;aspartame accounts for over 85% of the adverse reactions to food additives reported to the FDA.&quot; Those reactions include headaches, depression, dizziness, seizures, and weight gain. Several deaths have been reported. There is also evidence that aspartame contributes to birth defects.Her book details how the FDA first determined that aspartame was unsafe for humans, then later reversed itself. She obtained documents revealing the chemicals that constitute aspartame and how those chemicals behave in the human body.Sweet Poison is a must-read for anyone consuming food or drinks containing aspartame. At the least, it will open your eyes to what you're putting in your body. It might even save your life.",

Headaches, neurological symptoms such as losing feeling in my arm and face, and the scariest of all, I was having trouble thinking straight. I really was beginning to feel like a different person and there were times that I felt like I was going insane.Am I exaggerating?? I really wish I was, but sadly that was not the case. After speaking with my primary care doctor several times and having had tests done, I noticed that my symptoms improved at times, but nothing significant. I tried to put my finger on what the problem was, and one day while doing a search online, I found that some people who chewed Orbit gum were complaining of symptoms similar to mine. I had been chewing sugarless gum for years, and I never thought twice that what I was chewing could be hurting my body, potentially for the long term. After reading more, I immediately stopped using all products with aspartame/Nutrasweet/Equal and within a few short weeks I started feeling better.During my initial research regarding the link between aspartame and the symptoms I was experiencing, I stumbled upon the book \"Sweet Poison\" by Janet Starr Hull, the story of how she found out that aspartame was the cause of her very own health problems and her research behind how this original ulcer drug got into nearly every type of food we eat every day.Hull's story is very interesting, and anyone that wants to find out more about the story of how aspartame got into the United States food supply would be able to probably pick some bit of relevant information from this text, but I would be remiss if I didn't point out how sloppy the writing is. It's really a shame, because you get the point that the author really does care about educating the masses, but she would have been so better off if she had more people edit this book before it was published.My favorite parts of this book relate to the story of the shady way in which aspartame got on the shelves of supermarkets around the country and how it probably should have been stopped long, long ago. It's just a sad realization that the corporations control America and it's not a new trend. The original fights to get aspartame FDA approved date back to the 1970s, and through loopholes and political tricks that is exactly what happened in the 1980s.If you want to learn more about the history of aspartame and the story of an individual that had an adverse reaction to this drug, this is a nice read but it's very sloppy. Sometimes you will get done reading a paragraph and just say to yourself that the writing is outright POOR.Some people will read this book and just say it's a bunch of hogwash and they have never had a bad reaction to a diet soda, but I can tell you from personal experience that this chemical CAN cause major problems so buyer beware.In the battle between calories and chemicals, I'll take the calories, at least I can pronounce sugar more easily than many of the chemicals you see when you turn the label over of far too many foods that are purchased every single day.*** RECOMMENDED",

        "description": "Are we now, or have we ever been, a nation? As this century comes to a close, debates over immigration policy, racial preferences, and multiculturalism challenge the consensus that formerly grounded our national culture. The question of our national identity is as urgent as it has ever been in our history. Is our society disintegrating into a collection of separate ethnic enclaves, or is there a way that we can forge a coherent, unified identity as we enter the 21st century? In this \"marvelously written, wide-ranging and thought-provoking\"* book, Michael Lind provides a comprehensive revisionist view of the American past and offers a concrete proposal for nation-building reforms to strengthen the American future. He shows that the forces of nationalism and the ideal of a trans-racial melting pot need not be in conflict with each other, and he provides a practical agenda for a liberal nationalist revolution that would combine a new color-blind liberalism in civil rights with practical measures for reducing class-based barriers to racial integration. A stimulating critique of every kind of orthodox opinion as well as a vision of a new \"Trans-American\" majority, The Next American Nation may forever change the way we think and talk about American identity. *New York Newsday",

                "review/text": "It is impossible to do justice to such a wide-ranging book in only a few paragraphs. Fundamentally, Lind provides a three-phase interpretation of American history. As he sees it, the U.S. has experienced three genuine \"revolutions\": the American Revolution which led to the era of \"Anglo America\" (1789-1860), the Civil War/Reconstruction which led to \"Euro-America\" (1876-1954) and the Civil Rights Revolution which led to \"Multicultural America\" (1970-present).The book's middle chapters are a devastating critique of today's status quo. Lind finds fault across the political spectrum. \"Since the 1970s ... racial preference policies, associated with the political left, have been extended into one area of American life after another ... [Meanwhile] government policies unfavorable to labor, of the kind one thinks of as conservative, have been pursued under both Republican and Democratic administrations.\" However, \"In reality there is no contradiction between left-wing civil rights policy and right-wing economics.\"Instead of threatening the system, multiculturalism is corporate America's secret weapon. In the early 1970s it was President Nixon who instituted the first great wave of affirmative action and school busing, with the intent of driving a wedge between the labor and civil rights movements. (The strategy worked.) After the 1990 census, the first Bush administration collaborated with the civil rights establishment to reapportion and create as many black and Hispanic congressional districts as possible, thereby pulling the rug out from under white Democrats in surrounding districts and making it easier for the GOP to win control of Congress in 1994. As Lind notes: \"Tokenism provides suitably 'progressive' camoflauge for a system of divide-and-rule politics ... Without the political division of wage-earning white, black and Hispanic Americans along racial lines, it is doubtful that the white overclass would have been able to carry out its agenda of destroying unions, reducing wages, cutting employee benefits, replacing full-time workers with temps, and shifting the burden of taxation from the rich to the middle class, with so little effective opposition.\"Today there is no two-party system in the U.S. Rather, we have a one and a half party system -- a socially conservative corporate party (the Republicans) and a socially liberal corporate party (the Democrats). The \"conservative\" elites on Wall Street and the \"liberal\" elites in Hollywood both support outrageously high rates of immigration, affirmative action, and a dogmatic commitment to free trade.Lind puts forward a series of policy proposals that are an iconoclastic blend of conservatism and liberalism. Lind favors a system of \"proportional voting\" that would blow up the two-party duopoly and open the door to new parties and policy options. He would break the grip of special interests by banning all paid political advertising and replacing it with free and equal media time and mandatory debates. He would raise wages by banning unskilled immigrants (and potential terrorists) from entering the country and by repealing laws that encourage the use of temp labor. He similarly favors a \"social tariff\" on Third World imports. (Lind is not a knee-jerk protectionist; he opposes tariff barriers between First World countries.) He supports the repeal of affirmative action, not only for women and nonwhites but especially for wealthy white kids who secretly benefit from \"legacy preference\" in college admissions. He favors a \"war on oligarchy\" that would drastically reform the legal and medical professions too.This is an amazingly original and bracing book. Don't hold your breath waiting for Lind's ideas to be implemented any time soon. But he brilliantly spells them out, and that's the essential first step.",

                "review/text": "Every so often, I come across one of those books that really makes me think. Michael Lind's penetrating look at modern America, \"The Next American Nation: The New Nationalism and the Fourth American Revolution,\" is one of those books. I should elaborate a bit on that statement: books that REALLY make me think are ones that I will ponder at odd times during the day, or think about as I am falling asleep at night. I usually don't do that with a mass-market paperback or the latest popular novel. No, certain books on history, society, or philosophy sometimes find me puzzling out their theses while I engage in the mundane activities of daily life. Not every book has such an effect on me, but Lind's effort did. Written nearly ten years ago, \"The Next American Nation\" asks questions and puts forth conclusions imbued with intelligent insight and forceful conviction. It's iconoclastic, attacking the dogmas that presently govern every facet of our society. Despite the book's age, the issues Lind addresses continue to have relevance in the here and now. The author was once an editor at Harper's and The New Republic, as well as a contributor to The New York Times and The Washington Post.\"The Next American Nation\" probably falls under the category of American Studies, a once vaunted field of scholarship that fell on hard times once the multiculturalists took over academia. Lind's explorations borrow liberally from history, politics, sociology, and philosophy in a quest to put forth an overarching argument about where America should go in the future. According to the author, the United States has experienced three revolutions during its history, and it must experience a fourth one if it is to survive. Lind claims these revolutions birthed three distinct republics: Anglo-America (1789-1861), Euro-America (1875-1957), and Multicultural America (1972-present). Each republic put forth a national formula unique to its time. Anglo-America associated itself with Protestant Christianity flowing from a dominant Anglo-Saxon population. Euro-America embraced all white Europeans as authentic citizens while supporting a broader Judeo-Christian ethic. Multicultural America, which Lind despises for reasons he explains in minute detail, rejects the emphasis on Americans of European descent by elevating minorities to the status of autonomous nations within the larger society. Multiculturalists reject Christianity, replacing it with secular humanism as the new civic religion. Wars and other social turmoil led to the rise of these republics.Each republic survived due to grand compromises, extraconstitutional bargains that allowed the upper classes to thrive. Anglo-America's implicit agreement between the northern upper class and the southern planters allowed slavery to thrive until the Civil War. In Euro-America, the agreement was between white industrialists and poor white laborers to keep non-whites out of the work force. Multicultural America thrives on the repudiation of white supremacy while elevating five socially constructed race categories, which then compete for special favors from the government. Social classes, whether real or artificial, play a central role in Lind's analysis of American society. The author argues that a white overclass exists today, a class that thrives through credentials earned from top schools and nepotism at the highest levels of business and government. This overclass has taken control of both political parties, and uses multiculturalism to defuse resistance from minorities. Lind claims a black overclass, created through race-based handouts like affirmative action, relies on the white elites for power even as they condemn the white power structure. Meanwhile, the majority of the minority population languishes in slums across the country. In other words, multiculturalism is a tool of the elite designed to pit racial groups against one another while the upper classes rob the country blind.Michael Lind offers a solution to our problems. Scrap multiculturalism, the author avers, or else America will end up looking like a third world country (high crime rates and slums with the upper classes living in gated, privately protected communities). Liberal nationalism should become the Fourth American republic, nationalism based on a common language and shared social and psychological traits called Trans-America. Intermarriage will play a large role in this new nation, with the melting pot once again reasserting itself. Trans-America will abolish the nearly unchecked immigration of low skilled immigrants (they drive down wages for poor citizens), replace the current plurality election process with one of proportional representation, and ban political fundraising. Lind even offers a canon of Trans-American heroes from the past, from Alexander Hamilton to Frederick Douglass.Whew, is that a lot of material! I'm not even touching on key parts of his argument, but you get the idea. His solutions, however, do have many problems. Replacing the current way we elect officials, for instance, sounds like a solid plan. I would love to get rid of big money in politics. Proportional representation may not be the way to go since this form of government must rely on forming coalitions to elect leaders. Look at the difficulties in Israel and India, where the government is always collapsing as multiple parties duke it out for control. That's not the biggest problem in this book, though. Lind's ideas about class in America are solid, but how will he get people to think about class in a non-Marxist way? Class and Marxism go together like shoes and socks. Most people cannot even envision one without the other. Any effort to overcome the divides between social classes will have an uphill battle in a country that spent fifty years battling Marxism, to say the least. Still, Michael Lind's book is an effort to come up with some solutions to our current problems, one that goes outside the current dogmas in the process. The author is intelligent, a good writer, and truly seems to care about his country. A stellar read.",

                "review/text": "Michael Lind works hard in this book to create a &quot;liberial nationalism&quot; which is a possible argument against Multi-Culturalism. However, his &quot;understanding&quot; of the &quot;religious nativism of the right&quot; shows a smaller, perhaps naive or just perhaps just intentional loss of the big picture.Contains plenty of facts to show what America looks like, but the way the solutions he presents are unfocused, with seemingly unconnected pro-worker bits thrown in, hopefully to offset the loss of (in his words) &quot;Racial Spoils System.&quot; At points it sounds like a logical argument, but in the end it is missing some teeth.However, Lind writes with a sometimes refreshing dose of realism.Sometimes it feels that he is saying &quot;here I reveal how things really work, now here is how to fix them&quot; which often takes the wind out of his &quot;real people, real problems&quot; approach. The reader is going to think he'll go into some sort of &quot;pre-populist&quot; rhetoric, but then suddenly his solutions morph into undeveloped policy suggestions.Its interesting, also, that you get the sense of Lind's hope for strong federal government power, is more of an base to build on, assuming that it ends the &quot;racial spoils system.&quot;Lind puts lots of arguments out in front of the reader, to get them a good idea about the options, but often quickly dismisses them without first establishing or contrasting them in an unbiased way with his own &quot;liberial nationalism.&quot;Its unique reading, and it presents usually well-balanced arguments, but in the end, it doesn't show why liberial nationalism is needed or why the &quot;elite&quot; of the US would ever attempt to follow it.It is the first real step into &quot;Lind's Liberial Nationalism&quot; but it needs to be fleshed out quite a bit more, (as it seems undeveloped at this point) before it can be presented as a rational alternative to present systems.",

                "review/text": "Michael Lind provides a fantastic reinterpretation of American history while asserting a unique and contrarian vision for the future. He divides American history into three eras -- the first from before the Revolution through the Civil War, the Second from the Civil War to the early 60s, and the final one from the 60s to the current. He says the epochs differed from each other in that each one had its own informal (but very real) set of criteria that would determine whether a particular individual qualified as a &quot;true&quot; American citizen. To qualify for that title in the first era, one had to be white, Anglo-saxon, and Protestant. In the next era, a de facto American was considered to be anyone who was white and Christian. He describes the current era in overwhelmingly negative terms. First, he points out that affirmative-action programs have served to divide, rather than unite, the people of this nation by making individuals conceive of themselves as members of some artificial bureaucratically-invented ethnic group, rather than as members of an ethnically diverse America. Everyone except white males gets preferences these days, and Lind calls for the abolition of affirmative action by quoting the noble Martin Luther King, Jr. Despite taking a conservative stance on that one particular issue, (and, arguably, a few of his other stances are fairly conservative) Lind is no right-wing ideologue. In fact, he argues that the Republican and Democratic Parties (he used to be a Republican before changing his tune) are both dominated by the rich and influential through our campaign-finance system, which he likens to bribery. Lind writes extensively on the concentration of wealth in this country that has occurred over the last 25 years, and he blames conservatives who shifted the tax burden from the rich onto the poor. He proposes free college education for everyone, and a return to a progressive tax system based on one's ability to pay. Lind takes issue with the theory of free trade, whi! ch he asserts has worked only to the benefit of the rich and upper-middle class in this country. He also argues for a more restrictive immigration policy that is based on the admission of technically skilled foreigners into the country, asserting that such a policy would improve equality and efficiency in the economy. Lind addresses so many issues with such intelligence and insight that it is difficult to detail them all here. Lets just say he offers a brilliant and onorthodox view of history, and advances a comprehensive plan to get American past our current quagmire, and into our &quot;fourth era.&quot; His policy prescriptions and social perspective are developed by taking the very best ideas from the right and left, and melding them together. (on the balance, he is slightly left of the center, but certainly unique even among people in that grouping) While I didn't agree with everything he said (i'm somewhat more to the left), I was very impressed with this book, and agreed overwhelmingly with the basic themes expressed therein. This book's advice will probably not be implemented into policy by our ruling elites, but that's a shame. Lind has alot to offer in this book, which is one of the very best (and most unusual) analyses of American politics and history to be written in quite some time.",

Whereas certain other intellectuals and pundits sell-out to the conventional wisdom, Lind scrutinizes it, debunks it, defies it. That alone merits respect. There is so much to praise in this ambitious book, where to start? Lind presents a three-phase analysis of American history. Each phase has its own &quot;extra-constitutional bargain&quot; defining relationships between classes and who is or is not an authentic &quot;American&quot;. His presentation of the misbegotten evolution of affirmative action in the the third and current phase will open the eyes of liberal and conservative readers alike. Good stuff. Lind pokes fun at how much ink has been wasted over the years debating and studying the underclass to death, while no one says a peep about the havoc wrought by the overclass. In his account, the &quot;white overclass&quot; is no more than twenty percent of America's population and consists of overpaid attorneys, CEOs and others with post-graduate degrees who are animating both political parties with a free-market, largely libertarian worldview at odds with the populist &quot;wage-earning majority&quot; of all races and ethnic groups.

                "review/text": "In a new book, William B. Parsons Jr., MD tells why niacin, a drug whose use for cholesterol control he pioneered more than 40 years ago, is really a &quot;designer drug&quot; for this purpose. Niacin, unlike other drugs in this field, does everything right. It reduces bad cholesterol, increases good cholesterol, lowers triglycerides, and has favorable effects on several recently discovered components of blood cholesterol. No other drug does all these things, or even the first two. Best of all, niacin does all this in the presence of an ordinary American diet. Dr. Parsons calls his book, CHOLESTEROL CONTROL WITHOUT DIET! THE NIACIN SOLUTION, a wake-up call to the public and the media. When most people hear &quot;choelsterol,&quot; they think &quot;diet&quot; because advocates of diet have brainwashed the media, which in turn has brainwashed the public, including the medical profession, he contends. This book shares the author's long experience in research and use of niacin in medical practice. &quot;Although available without prescription, niacin is not a do-it-yourself drug; it requires knowledgeable medical supervision,&quot; the book repeatedly emphasizes. Parsons says that if every doctor were good at using niacin, more than 90% of patients with cholesterol problems could have the drug's distinctive advantages at a cost one-sixth to one-tenth the cost of the expensive &quot;statins,&quot; the best-selling cholesterol control drugs. Dr. Parsons has studied niacin since 1955, his final year of internal medicine training at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Following up on preliminary findings of Canadian doctors, he conducted the firstg systematic study of niacin's effects, which showed that it lowered bad cholesterol and raised good cholesterol without diet. His later work in Madison, Wisconsin led to the Coronary Drug Project, an 8-year study which showed that niacin decreased heart attacks, strokes, cardiovascular surgery, and deaths in men who had already had heart attacks. He advocatess starting prevention of heart attacks by using niacin in young adults as well as middle-aged persons with abnormal cholesterol patterns, then continuing in elderly patients who have no overriding medical problems. While practicing medicine since graduating from University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1948, Parsons has written many medical articles and chapters in several books. In this new book, he outlines for the general public and for physicians his vast experience in the safe and effective use of niacin. For the past 20 years he has practiced internal medicine in Scottsdale, Arizona. This is a very readable book for the general public. It teaches readers how to be sure their doctors are good at using niacin. &quot;The definition of a doctor good at using niacin? One who has read this book.&quot; The knowledge in CHOLESTEROL CONTROL WITHOUT DIET! THE NIACIN SOLUTION can very well reduce heart attacks and strokes, cardiovascular surgery, and deaths, as niacin did in the Coronary Drug Project. From the back cover: WHO NEEDS THIS BOOK? Everyone, really. !The 29 million Americans adults who have cholesterol patterns that should be treated. ! Anyone who has had a heart attack, coronary artery surgery, angioplasty, or other artery procedure, stroke, or surgery on neck or leg arteries. ! Close relatives of persons who have had a heart attack, stroke, or other problem just listed. ! Every adult who does not know his/her bad and good cholesterol fractions. ! Every doctor who does not know how important it is to be good at using niacin. ! Every pharmacist who may be asked to advise patients. ! Persons with excellent cholesterol patterns who are dieting when they don't need to be. ! Persons dieting for cholesterol problems but not tested to be sure their goals are being reached. ! Every persons with relatives or friends in any of these categories. YES--EVERYONE, REALLY!",

                "review/text": "This book contains a wealth of information about preventing heart attack and stroke, not limited to cholesterol control--although that is its main thrust. As in the first edition, it teaches that diet has so little to do with your cholesterol level that we might as well say it has nothing to do with it. The problem is that you inherited a body factory that produces too much bad (LDL) cholesterol, not enough good (HDL) cholesterol, or to much triglyceride. Total cholesterol is essentially irrelevant; you and your doctor need to know and manage all of those fractions.To change the body factory requires medication. The best medication is niacin, which does everything right (lowers LDLC, triglycerides, and Lp(a)--&quot;the heart attack cholesterol&quot;--while raising HDLC. The widely advertised, expensive statin drugs do only one thing well--reduce LDLC. Statin drugs had, until 2001 (no later figures available) caused 112 deaths in the US and resulted in withdrawal of one such drug (Baycol) from the market. Statins do this by causing rhabdomyolysis (&quot;dissolving of muscles&quot;), with circulating myoglobin then blocking the kidneys, causing kidney failure. The muscle pains that often accompany statin use are warning signs to stop those drugs. Read the fine print ot listen closely to the fast talk at the end of commercials, then decide whether the statin manufacturers are trying to sweep these hazards udner the rug.Some experts think statins may, in time, prove to cause cancer, based on the fact that they all cause cancer in animals.Niacin has a safety record dating to the 1950's, when the author pioneered its use at the Mayo Clinic. A landmark study, sponsored by NIH (not by drug companies) showed (in men who had already had one or more heart attacks) that niacin reduced both heart attacks and strokes by 25%, while also reducing cardiovascular surgery, hospitalization, and deaths--as compared to other drugs or to placebo.Why, then, haven't we heard more of niacin? Because it's not patentable; thus no one company benefits from its exclusive sale. Reliable, inexpensive niacin products are available. This is not a fad supplement; niacin has been approved by FDA for cholesterol control since the early 1960's.Although available without prescription, &quot;niacin is not a do-it-yourself drug,&quot; the autrhor points out repeatedly. It require knowledgeable medical supervision to monitor cholesterol results and be sure there are no untoward side effects. The nuisance effect of skin flushing at the onset of treatment is easily avoided by using time-release products and a daily aspirin for the first week or two. The book dispels rumors and myths that niacin is hard to take or that time-release products should be avoided.Worried about prescription drug costs and statin hazards? Niacin costs $10-14 a month for usual doses (less than the co-pay of most prescription drug plans), while statin prices vary from $42 to $142 a month, depending on drug and dosage.This book emphasizes what Laura Bush recently learned: that in women, heart attacks cause more deaths each year than all cancers combined. The book takes the position that heart attacks and strokes are largely preventable. A second copy for your doctor is a good idea. And since obesity has been upgraded to a major risk factor for heart attack (as well as diabetes and worn-out weight-bearing joints), you might also do well to consult the author's newest book, Tough Talk About Fat! How to Reach and Maintain Your Ideal Weight. (It doesn't scold a person for being overweight; it tells him to GET TOUGH with that excess weight and get rid of it--all of it!)",

Dr. Abram Hoffer discovered its cholesterol lowering effects in the early 50's and Dr. Parson's picked up where Dr. Hoffer left off and has more good information on niacin in this book than I've seen anywhere else. If you have elevated cholesterol, this is a must read.The information on niacin could not be more complete, but the limitations of the book are when it comes to cholesterol discussion. Dr. Parson's says diet doesn't matter, meat is okay, and vegetarians are not healthier, which flies in the face of all medical studies. I agree a low fat diet is not good, but avoiding meat helps prevent the cholesterol from oxidizing, which is when the trouble starts. Also, he doesn't really even mention anti-oxidants.If you want good info on niacin, buy this book!

Statin ads hide this warning in the small print or the fast talk at the end of expensive TV ads.* Niacin has a safety record dating to 1956.

I do not yet have my HDL level to the preferred minimum of 45, but am confident I will get there. Low HDL runs in my family and, fortunately, my total cholesterol and LDL are so low now, I don't believe I am in a high risk category anymore.The vast majority of Americans could prevent heart disease if they would become their \"own doctor\" and aggressively pursue a course of cholesterol treatment with a physician.It is odd that Niacin is still in the category of \"generally unknown\" given that it was the first drug used in treating cholesterol and still is one of the most effective and has the lowest cost.",

                "review/text": "The one big reason why we use statins in daily clinical practice is not for the cholesterol lowering ability, but for the dramatic reductions shown in cardiovascular morbidity (disease occurence) and mortality (death). The Coronary Drug Project (1966-1975) was a randomized controlled trial that enrolled men between the ages of 30 and 65 who had already had one or more heartattacks, and randomized them to receive either niacin or placebo. Despite the impressive numbers that Dr. Parsons cites in his book, there were some significant drawbacks. The study did not enroll women or men of non-caucasian backgrounds, nor did it show impressive mortality benefit until about 6 or 7 years AFTER starting the drug. Statins have shown a role in both prevention of the first MI and prevention of recurrence, and separates from placebo at a much faster rate than Niacin did in its study.To be fair to niacin, it does remarkable things for the HDL which is the good cholesterol. I have not had success with it in the past because I was probably dosing people wrong (too little, and all at once. His book suggests using higher doses and splitting the dose with meals), but I do have a fair share of patients who are quite leery of statins due to the press they have received with things such as memory loss, muscle aches, liver failure, etc. A recent study shows that niacin in addition to statins reduces risk further than a statin alone, but I have not seen head to head studies with niacin and statins. Although I do not do inpatient medicine, I know that people who are discharged with an MI from the hospital are put on statins. There is strong evidence to back up use of statins in patients with a prior MI, much more so than niacin. I believe that if you are relatively young, have a bad family history, and have other risk factors for heart disease (obesity, smoking) then niacin may be a good alternative. However, for people who are diabetic or who have already had an MI or a stroke, the rapid onset of protection with statins is much preferred. As always, talk with your doctor to see if niacin is right for you (ha ha, sounded like a commercial there).",

                "review/text": "Dr. Parsons has written a book that is valuable to consumers and healthcare providers for many reasons. One of the main strengths of the book is a debunking of the myth, perpetuated by \"Big Pharma\", that statins are the best agents to reduce cholesterol, when niacin clearly wins the cholesterol-control battle for the entire lipid profile, hands down. Parsons does a good job pointing out flaws in the statin studies and also exposing the huge financial role Big Pharma plays in pushing statins. The main problem with statins, which many MDs as well as the general public still do not understand, is they don't do much for several important lipid parameters faced by a huge majority of the population these days, which are elevated triglycerides and low HDL (\"good\") cholesterol, along with small-particle LDL. Fact is, statins do not tackle these parameters well- they are only moderately successful lowering high triglycerides, and are almost worthless raising HDL. Niacin, on the other hand, tackles these lipid factors head-on, and remarkably well. Of course, you'll never learn this from your statin companies, because niacin is a common vitamin and cannot be patented for huge profits like statin drugs can. Hence, the relative obscurity of promoting niacin's clinical superiority in the popular medical ads...But never count out Big Pharma. Aware that niacin is clinically superior as an HDL-raising (and all-around lipid improvement) agent, they have been very busy exploring ways to make money off of niacin. One way, obviously, is to pair niacin with one of the patented statins, which boosts profits. And indeed this is what happened with Advicor(tm) and other niacin-statin combinations. So now, to get around the inferiority of statins doing the job right, statins are paired with niacin and drug companies can claim much better results. Another strategy for drug companies to boost profits is to add something else to niacin that CAN be patented. Niacin manufacturers have long wanted an agent that reduces the so-called \"niacin flush\", and research has gone into possible anti-flushing compounds that could be added to the niacin and thus become a proprietary combination that could- you guessed it- once again be patented for mega bucks. For example, look for Merck's new \"Cordaptive\"(tm), a niacin/laropiprant combination, to be available soon. But once again, there are common supplements, at a much lower price, that could be used instead. For anti-flushing, check out recent research on flavonoids such as quercetin and luteolin.So, why only my 3-star rating (actually, I give it 3.5 stars)? For one thing, Dr. Parsons seems to share the \"old-school\" medical view that cholesterol itself is the main target for heart health, whereas recent research implicates more fundamental root problems, which concern one's endothelial health in general. In short, there is a growing recognition that low-grade inflammation, often linked with high-processed-carb diets/sedentary lifestyle and resulting insulin resistance, produces free radicals that cause a lot of damaging effects throughout the body. Cholesterol production is not a villain; in fact, cholesterol is vital to many bodily functions. When cholesterol goes haywire, such as LDL fractions shooting upward, it is indicative of a more basic problem, and cholesterol, far from being the bad guy, is actually the body's attempt to RESPOND to the problem. Parsons' breakdown into \"good\" vs. \"bad\" cholesterol, and his niacin solution to both these parameters, is vastly simplistic. Researchers moving in the direction of inflammation control, reduction of excess free radicals, improvement of general endothelial and hormonal health (never underestimate those hormones), optimizing nitric oxide production, etc., are focusing on a much larger, more fundamental, picture than Dr. Parsons is. Niacin is great, but the public should be learning that bad cholesterol is just a marker of more fundamental inflammatory conditions. Heck, tell your doctors too, because they generally don't know that either...after all, physicians tend to rely on their drug reps (who are highly-coached salespeople, not researchers), and \"cholesterol\" seems to be a convenient singled-out target that drug companies can greatly profit from. And physicians tend to be too busy/too lazy to question the drug-company sales-talk.There is speculation now that the reason why statins can be effective is not because of their cholesterol action per se, but rather a reduction of inflammation. But hey- a lot of actions impact on inflammation, and most of these cannot be patented, because they are a result of one's diet and activity patterns. And we can't use the excuse of \"bad genetics\" as a reason for drugs, since low-grade inflammation doesn't come from your genetics (which only reveals propensities), but rather is perpetuated by lifestyle habits and environment. The problem in trying to attack health conditions with just a \"pill\" strategy (drugs OR niacin), is that systemic inflammation can't be tamed by just focusing on symptoms- at some point the root problem needs to be addressed. Want to raise your HDL cholesterol? Niacin certainly can be useful tool, but so is cutting the refined junk out of your diet, making sure you are getting good nutrition (such as adequate Vitamin D), and getting proper exercise, which is what your body is designed to do. Voila! Watch how your HDL/triglyceride ratio improves. Dr. Parsons has already given up on food or exercise to help you, and dismisses your desire to make those changes...for you see, he takes a dim view of lifestyle changes in his book. But don't you follow him here. One should recognize that \"old school\" physicians like Dr. Parsons seem happy to concentrate only on improving cholesterol markers via a \"pill\" approach. Sadly, this is merely a \"band-aid\" approach to cardiovascular health.",

Yet this book's distinguishing feature is Governor Janos' (Jesse Ventura's) clear discussion of his political beliefs. You might not agree with Governor Janos' program, but his views should make you think about American politics and our times.Governor Janos bears watching. One day he might run for President.",

When Jesse Ventura came upon the political scene, I have to admit that his candor, honesty and his underdog victory awed me. In a way I truly believe that Jesse does represent all of us. Not just within the Democrat and Republican ranks, but every single American who is disenfranchised by the truth that is self-evident in the corruption in our Congress, our White House and our Supreme Court/Judiciary System. &quot;I Ain't Got Time to Bleed&quot; is the story of every average American youth to a certain degree, for I could take this complete book and with a few changes in story lines, places and overall path in life, fill in the blanks to tell my life's history also. As could many of us out here in America. That is the special quality Jesse Ventura has, he is a normal human being and American.I lost a little of the mystic when he (I believe) unfairly attacked Pat Buchanan who was doing nothing more than Jesse himself did, which was speak his mind. Then there was the truly ignorance attack on Religion.I was afraid Jesse had already been corrupted. And I believe he has been, to a certain extent, for backing someone like Donald Trump and ignoring the popularity of Buchanan cannot be called an intelligent move. He could work with Pat to make the Reform Party a true, unstopable force for good. That definitely makes me question Jesse's ability to stay true to his convictions.But after reading the book, pondering the man, and the many between the lines aspects of Mr. Ventura, I have come to realize Jesse just makes some dumb choices and says some dumb things, just like the rest of us. Which just makes him all that more real and vital to reforming the system. And a few old Marine Corps saying, explain the mistakes...&quot;open mouth insert foot&quot; or &quot;he engaged his mouth before his brain housing group&quot;.And his book clearly points out the subtle destructive manipulation of our system of government. Which has resulted after decades of moving away from what was an America of &quot;We the People&quot;...giving power to the government. Who then made laws, on our behalf, which were then to be carried out and supported by the Supreme Courts and lesser bodies without manipulation, changes or biased socialist views. It was changed into something totally different, deviant and illegitimate.Instead we have the courts usurping the peoples vote, the governments laws, common sense and then directing actions, misinterpreting the Constitution or declaring the peoples will unconstitutional so that they become the supreme leaders of America. In effect putting nine people who have never been elected into a position of absolute power.Which gives rise to the mentality that all people look to the courts, though idiotic law suits and appealing everything the voters desire, instead of the representatives they elect for redress of their grievances. Totally un-American and in direct contradiction to our Constitution. These nine people rather than enforce the peoples will are dictating what their will should and will be. That is worse than socialism, it is communisim by the Judiciary.On top of that add a corrupted system of lifelong politicians and the American people do need to wake up as Jesse says and get involved once again to save our Republic and their personl vote and influence.Jesse Ventura in his down home subtle ways, voices these deep seated concerns of all Americans, and very eloquently makes his book an easy and quick read for anyone, interested in finding out what real Americans are thinking. After reading the &quot;Politics of Bad Faith&quot; by David Horowitz which was very good. Jesses style in his book was a breath of fresh air for easy reading.The establishment, which includes politicians, the courts, the education system, and the media, as Jesse so readily points out are completely out of touch with reality and mainstream America.They have fallen victim like many others into believing that grassroots America is actually what the producers in Hollywood depict it as being. Such simple mindedness in those who think they are so wise is scary to say the least. And what Jesse clearly tells us is &quot;Professing themselves to be...wise they became fools.&quot; That is not just a Bible quote, it is a fact.I hope Jesse can endure and fight the temptation to become just another politician. He says he will not likely run for President. I think it would be a great mistake for him to do so. Oh, not because he couldn't win, I have no doubt he could. But it would turn him into the very thing he has taught us not to be, or not to try to be, a career politician.No, the best thing Jesse could do for the Reform Party, is to get reelected and do a fabulous job as Governor, go home and do all kinds of interviews and speaking engagements, about keeping his legacy alive in other cities and other states around the country. The freedom of this would make him a true force to be reckoned with.This is a book for all Americans to read, re-read, consider and respect.",

        "Title": "three weeks in october the manhunt for the serial sniper",
        "description": "In this New York Times bestselling book, the police chief who led one of the most suspenseful manhunts in American history takes readers behind the headlines into the notorious \"D.C. sniper\" case that held the nation spellbound. In October 2002, ordinary Americans feared for their lives, too frightened to pump gas at the local station or let their children play outside. For twenty-three nightmarish days, a series of random sniper killings terrorized the Washington, D.C. area and launched the largest manhunt in American history-under the harsh glare of a media frenzy. Three Weeks in October follows Charles Moose's efforts to crack a seemingly unsolvable case. As a stunned nation watched, Chief Moose stood tall in the face of horrific events-a courageous presence whose tenacity brought snipers John Allen Muhammed and Lee Boyd Malvo to justice. But this is also the inspirational story of Moose's rise from a young African American cop battling prejudice to a respected chief of police-who couldn't stop until he captured two of the most bizarre killers America has ever known. \"Compelling . . . A very candid story . . . Well worth reading.\"-The Washington Post \"Fascinating.\"-The Daily Oklahoman \"Gutsy, endearing, no-nonsense . . . [cuts] through all the hubbub to show that behind the provocative headlines was little more than a simple, heartfelt man just trying to do the best job he could.\"-Publishers Weekly",

                "review/text": "I remember those weeks in October very clearly: the news reports, the anxiety, the anticipation, the hopefulness that the perpetrators would be caught or taken down. The fact that Maryland has some of the most stringent gun control laws in the nation was ironic, as well.In this reader's opinion, Charles Moose did nothing but hurt the investigation. He initially ignored early eyewitness testimony and gave a 'look out' only for white males in a white delivery box van of varying descriptions. Thanks to this initial denial of evidence, Malvo and Muhammed slipped through checkpoints at least once, despite the suspicious cutouts in the trunk of their blue sedan.The cracking of case, despite Moose's claims, did not come at his hands, but at the hands of a courageous citizen (a truck driver) who had listened to the late-breaking media leak that the suspects were black males driving a blue, older-model sedan. A whopping two hours later, the shooters were caught.An Army vet, Steve Cribbin, was a witness to the first Beltway sniper shooting: \"I told a cop I was in my car waiting to go to work [outside Papa John's Pizza in Aspen Hill, Md], just resting, and I heard a gunshot, and being I was in the military, I knew it was a rifle. It didn't sound like a backfire,\" said Cribbin during an interview. \"And I looked around and said, 'Man, where in the hell did that come from?' The next thing I know I see a car driving out, and it was, like, a dark blue Thunderbird or an old cop car, with a couple of black guys giving high-fives and driving away.\"The detective that took his statement was Montgomery County Detective Chris Homrock. Finally, days later (and several killings later), the multi-agency sniper task force, headed by Moose, sent out a homicide detective to field-interrogate Cribbin about his prior statements. The detective, according to Cribbin, was suspicious of his testimony and tried to talk him out of his statements, asking, \"How do you know it's black people?\" Cribbin, while uncertain of the car make, was certain of the driver & passenger as it was still light out when he saw them.As later reported, Moose refused to give out physical descriptions of the suspects until very late in the investigation because he said he didn't want to \"paint some group.\" One Montgomery County PD detective said Moose was worried about patrol officers \"stopping every black in Montgomery County. Of course, it was OK to stop every white in a white box truck.\"Moose has a race-obsessed past, taking advantage of innocent situations and screeching \"racism\" or \"discrimination\" at the slightest question or inconvenience, then attempting to settle the proceeding suit for large sums of money. One known \"successful\" case was with the Marriott Corporation (for $200k). He fought furiously against the Montgomery County PD to get them to allow him to write and sell this book, despite longstanding ethics regulations preventing him from profiting from his job as police chief. In fact, because of the timing of the release (the start of the trial), the prosecution's case could have been jeopardized. Despite the Montgomery County ethics board's unanimous ruling against its release, Moose ignored them and released it anyway, and (he and his wife) then hurled reckless charges of racism at county employees.He says in his book that \"We must all be social engineers\" and admits to having \"complicated\" feelings about Muhammad and Malvo because they are black. His greed and racial-blinders may have cost some people their lives. Thankfully this book did not jeopardize the trial.Do not give this man any more money. ...",

                "review/text": "As someone who was directly affected by the sniper shootings (I live in Hanover County, Virginia, where the Ashland shooting took place) I found this book pathetic and Chief Moose even more so. Moose fails to admit fault for just about anything and blames race for everything. Further, it is extremely obvious this book was rushed to print as there were glaring errors in it which a little research would have corrected. First, I had a good laugh when Moose discussed the white, good old boy, southern police here in the Richmond area and how they were prejudiced against a black northern police chief. The Richmond city police department is led by Chief Andre Parker, a black man who was hired from Illinois. In fact, the last 3 police chiefs in Richmond have been black and a white person has not held the position in about 20 years. Sheriff Stewart Cook of Hanover County was the voice of the combined law enforcement effort here in the area, but he worked very closely with Chief Parker as well as the other chiefs in our area to protect the citizenry.Also, Moose says Ashland is south of Richmond. Ashland is about 20 miles north of the city of Richmond.This book is like Moose's handling of the sniper incident. Full of mistakes, ineptitude and a rewriting of history. Moose bungled the investigation so badly that the police, ATF, and FBI in Virginia had no choice but to try and tackle the task on their own. Moose's abuse of the media to get his name and face on TV caused deaths rather than prevented them.The worst thing about the book is when anything negative happens to Moose, he constantly screams racism rather than accepting responsibility for his own shortcomings and moving on. Even the back of the book jacket starts off with how he was born a black boy in the segregated South. This from a man with a checkered past of his own on race relations.Chief Moose, get over it and move on. The best thing you did was leave your position so that competent leadership could hopefully prevail.",

That happens to also be one of the nicest things I can say about the book. This review is really the tail of two books, the first book is the one I was interested in reading, which covered the Washington DC area sniper case. The second book is a history of the author, which I honestly did not care about. I will give the editor credit, he did keep the two sections in separate chapters, which made it easy as I got into the book to pass by the personal history parts. So on the section I wanted to read, well to say the writing was wooden would unfairly give trees a bad name. I have no idea how these two guys, the police chief and the ghost writer, managed to reduce an exciting and interesting story into a cure for insomnia, but they did it. Pfizer needs to bottle this and call it Sleep Fast because it was brutal to get through. To top off the dullness overload they provided less info then I could get from a single newspaper report of the incident. I bought this book to get all the good inside info, not white washed info that was already provided to the public.The sections of the book that dealt with the personal history of the author actually were written with a bit more spunk then the rest of the book. The only problem was that this guy is the most race aware public figure this side of Al Sharpton. Everything in the world is seen through a white black lens for this guy. It got so old reading about every slight or problem he ever had in his life that he could somehow link to racism. I have no doubt there have been events that he has been disadvantaged due to race, but it got to be too much. I really got the feeling that he was mad at every white man in the country and that he felt there was no way that a white man and black man could come together on any issue. His views on the subject were overbearing and rude. It was so much that he even went out of his way to identify every black person he writes about yet not the race of any of the other people. I have no idea why.So here is a book that I felt was about 50% bait and switch, I dare you to find on the cover or dust jacket any mention that over half of the book is this guys life story. What disappointed me even more about the content is that the authors could have given us so much more detail of the investigation. No pictures, no reprints of any of the messages, no transcripts of the recorded calls, the lack of detail was very disappointing. Overall I am very disappointed by this book. The author did detail out the case, but in almost a cliff notes fashion. The section of the book that details his life are written with such a chip on his shoulder that it makes this half of the book tiresome and distasteful. Overall I would not recommend this book other then the author says part of the proceeds are sent to a fund for the victims.",

When I saw Chief Moose on television during the investigation I had the same initial reaction pretty much everyone else did. While he lacked the smooth slickness of a man accustomed to being in the limelight, he came across as a strong leader and a truly dedicated public servant. Boy, did this guy have me fooled, and would I eventually feel like a sucker for it.It's pretty clear now that inside this brave and dedicated exterior lies a man full of anger and personal demons. Right up to the very final minutes of the investigation, he either knowingly and deliberately misled the public as to the true nature of the assailants, or he was so blinded by his own personal prejudices that he simply could not face up to the evidence that was plainly in front of his face. In either case, such a man isn't fit to run Mayberry's police department, much less one of a large suburban county. Some cursory research into his past will show a long history of problems, caused in no small part by a giant racial chip on his shoulder. And in the end, his inability to abide by the rules set by his bosses led this dedicated public servant to dump his entire career in order to make a quick buck, which led to the book you're reading about here.Don't let this con-artist dupe you yet another time. If you absolutely must read it then check it out of the library, but don't reward this guy financially after what he did.",

It doesn't take much research to realize that this is a person with a permanent chip on his shoulder and perhaps someone to be ignored at all costs. A better representation of what these three weeks entailed for people in that region of the country, will probably come from one of the several OTHER books about to be released on this subject.

Chief Moose had NOTHING to do with the capture of the snipers. The incompetence of his team and the misinformation that he spewed out on a daily basis, did nothing to apprehend the snipers. If anything, it allowed them to continue terrorizing the area for that much longer.I did respect Chief Moose at one time, but after I heard about him giving up his job, morals and ethics for the almighty dollar, I was--and remain--disgusted by him. It is inconceivable to me that any human with half an ounce of dignity would stoop as low as he has. I don't know how many millions he was paid to put out this garbage, but if he was truly the role model he purports himself to be, he should donate every penny of his proceeds to the families of all of the victims.If I can take any comfort at all, it is the fact that this book is obviously selling very poorly.

        "description": "Going Postal examines the phenomenon of rage murder that took America by storm in the early 1980's and has since grown yearly in body counts and symbolic value. By looking at massacres in schools and offices as post-industrial rebellions, Mark Ames is able to juxtapose the historical place of rage in America with the social climate after Reaganomics began to effect worker's paychecks. But why high schools? Why post offices? Mark Ames examines the most fascinating and unexpected cases, crafting a convincing argument for workplace massacres as modern day slave rebellions. Like slave rebellions, rage massacres are doomed, gory, sometimes inadvertently comic, and grossly misunderstood. Going Postal seeks to contextualize this violence in a world where working isn't-and doesn't pay-what it used to. Part social critique and part true crime page-turner, Going Postal answers the questions asked by commentators on the nightly news and films such as Bowling for Columbine.",

It's devastating. I felt a little dirty bringing my copy into work. My boss asked me what I was reading, I told him about it, and then said, \"You'd better watch out,\" because I'm something of a loose cannon. He told me to shut up, and that was that.Anyway, the book. What Mr Ames lacks in writing ability (not much, but his language is thick with judgmental adjectives that make the reading more arduous- maybe this was his intention?) he makes up for in original thought, and this book is a complex and original work. Revolutionary would not be too strong a word. He compares post office, workplace and school shootings to slave uprisings, and goes far into his comparisons by quoting the language surrounding both rebellions. Where Columbine's murderers were motivated by base evil and video games, Nat Turner's slave army seemed to be motivated by base evil and the ingratitude and treachery of the negroes, in the media accounts of the time. Ames doesn't think these accounts cover for the hostile environments that precipitated the attacks, rather he believes that the problem was that slavery was ingrained in the value systems of Nat Turner's time, so much so that they couldn't see anything anyone would find objectional about it, in much the same way that we can't admit now that our culture has something to do with the recent epidemic of rage massacres. Can you believe?- 45 school shootings in the 2003-04 academic year alone.It's an unwieldy topic, but Ames does a terrific job with it. One thing I would have liked to see would be a handling of the original march to unionization.

                "review/text": "When you crack open a book entitled \"Going Postal,\" you don't expect to start reading about the antebellum South. But Ames starts by transporting us back in time in service of his provocative theme - that today's rage murders in workplaces and schools are contemporary forms of slave rebellion, indeed the only possible form of rebellion in a society as decollectivized and militarized as the modern corporate United States.In this highly original and intriguing analysis, Ames ridicules \"copycat\" pundits who myopically search everywhere but right in front of their faces to explain the wave of workplace and schoolyard shootings that has swept through the United States over the last couple of decades. Hollywood movies, video games, the National Rifle Association, mental illness, bad parenting - the list of potential culprits is endless. But never the \"toxic culture\" of the institutions that breed these doomed revolts.Whereas initial news accounts often vilify shooters as almost cartoon cutouts - mentally imbalanced, trench-coated racists or kooks - Ames offers in-depth portrayals, so we come to know them as ordinary human beings oppressed and stressed to the breaking point by a ruthless corporate or school environment. Attempts to profile individual offenders fall flat, Ames argues, because the offenders are potentially anyone. As evidence, he catalogs the widespread sympathy for many of the shooters among their former coworkers and classmates. One would never see such sympathy among victims of serial sex murderers, he points out.Instead of profiling the individual rebels, Ames profiles the institutions. Shootings, he argues, happen in corporate environments rife with alienation, surveillance, mandatory unpaid overtime, and humiliating and degrading layoff rituals, where managers consciously harness fear to increase worker stress and insecurity. Sites of school shootings, meanwhile, are brutal environments where students undergo horrific torment only exacerbated by Zero Tolerance crackdowns.This book is meticulously researched and brilliantly argued. It's too bad that Ames couldn't find a better publisher, because the technical quality is extremely poor and the copy editor must have been on an extended coffee break. I understand that his first publisher bailed after 9/11. But the typos, overly small text, and poor binding are all minor, superficial flaws that should not stop you from buying and reading this fascinating book.PS: Coincidentally, and unbeknownst to me at the time, the latest rampage was underway, at Northern Illinois University. Although some other shooters have left written explanations or made posthoc statements (all included in Ames' book), this case is unusual in that killer Steven Kazmierczak co-authored a scholarly journal whose prophetic thesis almost exactly parallels Ames'.

Well, according to Ames, that depends on your mental health. 'Normal' folks just smile and suck it up, letting it build up and eat out their insides, and in this way make it through yet another soul-crushing day. If you're one of the normal folks, then this book is for you. If you're thinking of going postal, well... this book might just push you over the edge. You'd better stick to your John Grishams and Suze Ormans.Ames is able to write about something so basic to our existence (the school and office ARE the settings of our lives, he rightly points out) because he has earned perspective: He's a SoCal native (not coincidentally, the coastal 'paradise' where many US rage murders are concentrated) who has worked for years as a journalist in Russia. This perspective helped him notice things so elementary and important that we Americans take them for granted, and hence, ignore their significance. Even two decades and dozens of rage murders haven't shaken us out of our zombie-like stupor. It takes somebody like Ames -- one of us, but then, not really one of us -- to pull back the curtain and reveal how cruel, petty, and spiritually debilitating our lives in America are.And it doesn't have to be this way. This state of affairs was not inevitable. Most of us are better than this; it's the priveleged bullies who have convinced us that the way we live --and let's face it, it sucks -- is the only alternative. This mass deception, this spiritual heist, was what got me so fired up as I read this. The majority of us don't even know what's in our best interests anymore.My thanks to Mark Ames for writing an extremely timely and powerful book. This is required reading for all the stressed out, overworked, bullied, and fed up Americans, and for all foreigners who seek to understand just why, in some sense, America is the way it is. You may think you know; you may not want to know; but you NEED to know the truth.I can't say enough, except: Buy this book.",

In the end, when the institution takes everything including truth, compassion and dignity, the rational response is rage, murder and rebellion.This is a well-researched book, put out by someone who spent a lot of time researching and documenting the pattern. Ames' unlikely connection between slavery and the working man is made convincingly, with slavery occasionally being the more humane of the two.I left government service recently, after watching three supervisors fall prey to love-hate dependency-based work relationships. All of them eventually succumbed to rage. I spent time speaking with other office employees, both former and current, who lost their emotional balance and faded into oblivion, whether fired or effectively incapacitated. I had to read this book to understand the dynamics behind this less-than-rare phenomenon. Ames' validation is a double-edged sword. What is frightening is the notion that this oppression occurs frequently, but is never documented until someone commits mass murder. Ames notes in his book that rebellion occurs with great infrequency, as the unknown is always more frightening than the known, however unpleasant.\"Going Postal\" is a must-read book, although it is less gory than it is reflective. Ames is an excellent historian and consolidator of relationship dynamics. His ability to interview his subjects and pick up on the details -- sometimes even humorous in a macabre way -- makes this a facinating documentary.",

Sadly, I expected to find hundreds of reviews here, so it looks like the mainstream media's \"ignore it and hope it goes away\" is working.The ideas are incendiary enough to appeal to both liberals and conservatives, because almost all of us have been badly abused, either in school or in the workplace. And so all of us feel the truth of the book deep in our bones.What's sad is that it doesn't have to be this way. We have enough robotic technology to create a utopia where we all work an average of 20 hours a week at jobs we enjoy. So why haven't we done so?One of the book's greatest insights is how, in a hundred years, we might look back upon this century, and be amazed at how blind we all were \"back then.\" (Just like we can look back at slavery now and be amazed at all the pro-slavery blindness.)My only criticism is in what the book omits: 1) why are we so docile, when an uncensored look at US history shows us rising up repeatedly, at least until the 1950's; 2) our moral and social decline--whatever happened to self-sacrifice, altruism, and visions of a better world?I'd answer both omissions just as Ames would: corporate dominance is responsible. Adam Smith, the \"father of capitalism,\" wrote in 1776 that a capitalist economy of many small businesses could be very good. (Perhaps we ought to try it someday, and see if Smith is right!) But Smith warned that a capitalist government (he called it a government run by merchants) is likely to be the worst government imaginable.",

His study is of work-place rage killings, though a side mention is made of school massacres as an extension of these crimes with academia's increasing resemblence to the workplace being the fuel for the fire.Ames asserts that you can pin workplace rage killings as a phenomenon that became big in the 1980s, largely due to changes resulting from Reagan's policies, which had some time to take effect. Americans became increasingly worse off, for the most part, with untold gazillions shifted from the middle class folks to the wealthiest upper crust. The corporate culture came to dominate, with management becoming a new class of comissars, sort of. More competition. A rat race for everyone. Basically, what's happened to the USA. Half the country is broke, 1% of the uber-rich have utterly ridiculous weath, and society moves toward a two-tier model, with a small sliver for the people who have to work in the coal mines of corporate America. And that's a not a fun country to be part of, sorry.The book is grim. Extremely grim and angry. And it should be...Ames tries to explain these crimes in some kind of context, and he's rightly angry about the whole business. While America is collectively unable to discuss its current socio-economic issues with seriousness, then rage murders will just continue. And so they did since this book appeared, with a whopping massacre at Virginia Tech.These disturbing crimes, which rock the country every once and a while before being swept away in an investigation about shooting logistics in the press, are a truly American thing, Ames posits. The specific changes in American society during the 1980s, starting with the firing of the air traffic controllers union, and continuing with the dominance by corporate power and well, greed, have given rise to a generation of beaten-down modern-day wage slaves. And the shootings are sort of rebellions. This is perhaps the most 'controversial' of Ames' findings. But the bottom line of this book is you might lose your mind reading it, it hits so close to home. We are not spared in Ames' skewering. The obviousness of it all makes you doubt the whole business and want to go buy a new iPod.Highly recommended for pretty much most working American adults. Be warned, this book is angry, and might make you go off the deep end if read at the wrong time---with the relentless pounding away at modern life in America and the money culture, combined with the disgust of the country to sort it out, Ames finally asks \"What the hell is wrong with us?\"",

Instead, lawyer Edgar Steele's book \"Defensive Racism\" is both entertaining and easy to read. Mr. Steele's exposition of the racial situation is laid out for the reader in a simple, logical style which takes the reader on a survey of the racial questions which are current in America. The first thing the book takes on is race: is it real, is it OK to recognize that racial differences exist? The conclusion is that race does exist, the evidence is overwhelming and that it is OK to see that this is true. There are differences in skin color which aren't really very important but which are obviously inherited. There are differences in intellectual capacity which are much more important and are inherited. Most important of all, there are differences in character which are inherited. To Mr. Steele, these are the most important differences because they determine how we interact with the people around us. Steele discusses how animal breeders select for character in their dogs, in their horses, how the breeding for character and personality has a long history in the selection of domestic animals. He then shows research to support the contention that human character is also inherited and has been selected in different populations and, to use that word, races. Unlike other books on these topics, Mr. Steele's writing style is light and entertaining, yet very to the point. I was surprised to see my teenage daughter reading the book at a friend's house and complaining because we didn't have a copy so she could finish reading it. Now that's an endorsement of an engaging writing style! Unlike a lot of books on the racial problems in America, \"Defensive Racism\" isn't just about race. The book also discusses related national problems such as the true cost of unrestricted third world immigration, our current middle eastern wars and why we are there (Israel figures large in this discussion), a history of past wars with an explanation of the motives behind those wars (it wasn't just because we we were good and the other guys were bad), a chapter on economics that even a teenager can understand along with a prediction of an economic meltdown as the costs of racial problems overwhelm our ability to pay. The book ends with a discussion for \"New America\" one based on facts rather than racial fantasy. This is not a book about racial intolerance but rather a plea for racial understanding, a realistic look at race and what we need to do to make our country better. I can see why lawyer Steele was so successful in the courtroom, he is very understandable and very persuasive. I highly recommend this book.",

So why am I now writing a review on a book that is almost certain to soon be banned here in Canada and giving it a very favourable rating ?I watched as Ernst Zundle was deported after a secret trial in which prosecution witnesses offered anonymous testimony . The judge's comments clearly insinuated guilt only on the basis of association . He said nothing about the veracity of Mr Zundles claims nor did he implicate him in any violent act . What was being hidden here from public view ?Why does our media constantly harp about Islamic terrorists while completely overlooking a brutal occupation by Israel ? One has only to read Ha'aretz ( an Israeli newspaper ) to see constant examples of reprehensible behaviour by IDF soldiers . We hear nothing of that here and it seems that when someone's dog gets hit by a car , Islamic exteremists are to blame . Our media is constantly trying to involve our nation in the mideast conflict and the scary part is they want us on the side of those who caused the wars in the first place .Those issues made me question things but the event that made me understand there is a serious problem that is not being addressed happened a few weeks ago . My daughter was denied funding for college strictly because her father is WHITE ! The funding officer even stated that to her outright . I have always taught my daughter that people are equal and to never make a decision about someone because of their race . I no longer say that as I am no longer asleep .Mr Steele's book explains some of the contradictions of affirmative action without resorting to hate mongering . This book is very important and raises issues that must be addressed . It is very readable and covers a diversity of topics . His main theseis is that there are more differences among the races than mere colour of skin and these differences do not make any one race better than another .He goes off in tangents at times such as a lucid account of our current money system and it's fraudulent nature . That alone is worth the cost of the book and Mr Steele still effectively ties it into his central argument . He suggests that the inevitable collapse of our economy due to the excess of debt that our money system propagated will lead to conflict between those who produce ( pay taxes ) and those who consume ( gov't entitlements ). There is clearly a racial distinction between the two aforementioned groups . A bleak outlook for America's future and implications for Canada as well .A very worthy read overall dealing with sensitive issues from a realistic perspective rather than simple minded political correctness . Every Canadian who may wonder why we have been invloved in recent wars and why the push for us to get involved in the latest ( war on terror ) will find the answer here . There is an element within our society that is bent on destroying our peaceful values by infecting us with hatred .I found Mr Steele's scenario of North America being divided into areas based on race somewhat implausable . A very minor point when taken in the full context of the book .",

Knowing this and having also occasionally listened to his internet web radio show, his book was mandatory reading for me.Make no mistake, this book is not for the politically correct. Mr. STEELE dares to speak out unpopular facts, which are more often than not suppressed by the controlled media. He challenges the popular conception of racial equality with irrefutable facts, for instance regarding the huge gap in IQ among the various human races. But IQ is not the only difference between the races:\"Blacks have demonstrated markedly lower levels of empathy, personal responsibility, behavioural inhibitions and parental investment in children, among a great many other things.\" (p.77)As the author correctly points out these differences are evolutionary responses to different climates (e.g. harsh winters in the Northern hemisphere helped to advance intellectual capabilities among Caucasians and Northern Asians, while the hot African climate favoured physical strength over intellect) and were inherited over thousands of generations.Also crime rates are scrutinized in the book. Did you know that according to official US government figures* 64% of all violent crimes arrests are of Blacks?* 60% of all Blacks are armed with a weapon at all times?* Black neighbourhoods are 35 times as violent as those of Whites?Or that the overwhelming majority of hate crimes are not white-on-black, but the other way around? Of course this is not reported in the politically correct media, as these facts contradict the popular cliche.Mr. STEELE also details the other ills of White America (and European civilisation in general) like unfettered illegal immigration and its tremendous toll on the population, globalisation (with high level jobs outsourced and physical jobs given to cheaper illegal immigrants), the price of Empire (cf. the enormous human and economic loss during the current Middle Eastern adventures), the effects of hate crime and thought crime legislation (used to silence political dissidents), reconquista (millions of illigal immigrants from Mexico and the demand from Mexican nationalists, that south western US states be seceed to Mexico or a new Hispanic state called Atzlan be constituted), the Federal Reserve Bank system and the overwhelming Jewish influence. I particularly liked how Mr. STEELE exposes Jewish supremacy and the cost of the US support for Israel (circa 2.5 billion dollars since 1973 WITHOUT the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and also not including hundreds of billions caused by the Arab oil embargo in the late 1970ies, which of course was a response to the ongoing US support for Israel - see pages 93 and 94 of DEFENSIVE RACISM).DEFENSIVE RACISM is overall a good book. Although I am Austrian I could relate well to it, because while the situation in the USA may be worse, we face exactly the same problems here in Europe.Unfortunately the book is not without flaws. I do not want to nitpick, but there are a few errors. For instance, while it is absolutely true that Communism was a Jewish invention, contrary to the authors claims (p. 103)the Russian revolutionary leader LENIN was in fact a gentile (and not of Jewish descent). Once the author quotes former US president Theodore ROOSEVELT to support his views (see p. 349), although in effect the quote contradicts Mr. STEELE's position.More importantly, it is necessary to note that many of the arguments of the book are also voiced by other authors and politicians like the great David DUKE (and, it has to be said, better sourced and formulated.)I also do not buy into the author's 9/11 conspiracy theories. Last not least I have issues with the author's views regarding governmental role and welfare (which obviously is not a bad thing in itself), though an in-depth discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of my review.As a final remark it is important to note that the book does not promote violence or supremacy, it just argues for racial separation.",

We are at a precipice, awaiting the nudge that will send us over it's edge. Edgar Steele names those who are intent on providing that nudge that will send this country to it's irreversible decline for their own selfish, vile reasons. This is a book that every American of European ancestry needs to read to learn about the truth that has been kept secret by the real controllers of this country.",

                "review/text": "For weeks I walked to and from work, over one hour each way, to help drop through a weight plateau of 199 pounds. No matter what I did, including dieting, I was destined to be a 199-pounder for life! Then, one Sunday evening, I read the first few chapters of a book a friend lent me, &quot;Sugar Blues&quot; by Dufty. My first reaction to the information contained in it was entirely emotional: anger and disgust. Until that moment I had never given sugar a moment's worth of thought. That Sunday evening, I felt my anger so intensely, that I promised myself that I immediately would stop my ingestion of sugar for MORAL reasons. As I read further, I wished that I had known this information years ago. I wished that I had used this information while raising my children. I am saddened that I didn't get to the profound wisdom in this book sooner than I did. But, life is full of important lessons. This book is but lesson number one. And learning this lesson later is better than not learning it at all. While reading &quot;SUGAR BLUES&quot; I was also reading another book on the topic of meats. I decided to give up sugar and meats. That Sunday evening, I switched to a SWEETENER-FREE and meat-free lifestyle. On Thursday of that week I spent time between the fetal position in bed and sprinting to the washroom. I thought I had the flu, but looking back, I now realize I had what I'd describe as, &quot;withdrawl&quot; symptoms. 24 hours later I was feeling better. 7 days later, when I weighed myself, I received the first of many self-fulfiling rewards: I cracked my weight-loss plateau, was finally down to 190 pounds. Three weeks later, I lost another 6 pounds and was down to 184. Seven weeks later I was at 177. 10 weeks later 174. I have had to tighten my belt 5 notches! I fit into pants that I had not fit into since 1978. As of this last week, I stabilized at a weight plateau of 174 pounds. I have lost a cool 25 pounds. This book made me THINK about the quality of, and effect from, the &quot;foods&quot; I shovelled into my mouth. This book motivated me to read the labels before I bought. It is an absolute MUST HAVE for your home library...a MUST SHOW to friends who you care about...a book that you MUST DOG-EAR and underline, (use over and over again). It might be a good idea for you to think about buying several or more copies of this book in paper back version, (low cost), to either give away or circualte among your friends and relatives. If you do, you just might enhance your life and theirs. Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts about &quot;SUGAR BLUES&quot;. By sharing my experience I am hoping that your life will become healthier. All the best in your decision to buy &quot;Sugar Blues&quot;.",

Sugar in EVERYTHING (even soups and vegetables) makes it very hard to stop totally but what I remember most about William Duffy's comments were the similarity to cocaine use when sugar was first introduced -- the first sugar users brought it to parties and it was a great specialty.

Anyone who has seen The Insiders and the power that the tobacco industry has, can understand the enormity of trying to attack the sugar industry.AS a PS, Sugar in everything is an American phenomenon.

According to the author, most major evils were caused by sugar: the Bubonic Plague, The Crusades, Slavery, Witchunts and every physical and mental problem experienced by the human race. He also slams the medical profession,the Catholic Church, European and US governments and the ruling and industrial elite. While I agree that too much sugar is harmful and unhealthy, Dufty's extreme views detract from his message. He sounds like a conspiracy theorist. His conclusions are not supported by scientific or historical facts but are rather conjecture and personal opinion. Dufty tries to imply support by using footnotes, but the referenced material is inadequate. His logic is also seriously flawed. For example, he claims that because the Plague struck city dwellers (who consumed more sugar) instead of country dwellers (who consumed less sugar), one's consumption of sugar made one more susceptible to the Plague. He completely ignores the fact that the Plague was caused by fleas on rats who flourished in the crowded, unsanitary cities. It is hard to wade through the hyperbole in this book. It seems like Dufty is a very angry person with an axe to grind. This makes it hard to take his book seriously.",

So I bought it at the local health food store. He starts off with his own sugar hell and redemption and then delves into the whole history of the cane. Very interesting, healthwise and also politically. This is the meat of the book. (The Boston &quot;Tea&quot; Party? More like the rum party.) I like his writing style; he keeps it homespun. (Why did some think this book needs more &quot;hard science&quot;? Isn't it already in there? It's not intended to be in a medical journal [which can't always be trusted!].) When I tell people I'm sugar-free they usually scoff, saying sugar's not that bad for you, why give it up completely. Well, now I wake up clear and I get through the afternoon w/o any flagging of energy. At various times of the day I'll feel some energy racing through my body. (A great feeling; keeps me motivated.) Now I need less food on my plate, and my hypoglycemia has all but disappeared. (Think about THAT one, folks.) Never eat &quot;refined sucrose&quot; again! It can be done! Sky's the limit!

I have no love for the sugar industry and avoid all forms of refined sugar, so I came to this book with a very open mind. I'm also a diabetes educator, and I've worked with thousands of children with diabetes. The author's historical information was interesting and enlightening. I thought, hmm, good introduction to the topic. Then, he started on the diabetes angle, and as each page went by I started getting more and more disgusted with the book.There are two problems with his diabetes-related information.First of all, he makes no distinction between type 1 diabetes and type 2.Secondly, his smug attitude toward the development of insulin is strikingly cold and lacking in understanding. Much of the genuine information about the dangers of refined sugar is lost in the author's seeming obsession with belittling the development and use of insulin.To be more specific, without going on forever:The development of type 2 diabetes is certainly related to modern lifestyle choices and poor nutrition. However, many adults with type 2 are thin and don't fit the usual \"profile.\" Most people with type 2 do not use insulin at the onset of their disease, and may never use insulin if they lose weight and improve their nutrition and physical activity.Type 1 diabetes, however, is an autoimmune disease whose development is not related to lifestyle. It has been documented in ancient cultures (contrary to the author's claim), and always led to death at an early age, until the discovery of insulin in 1920 by Banting and Best. Again, contrary to what the author might lead one to believe, they did not win the Nobel prize so that millions of sugar-addicted adults (with type 2 diabetes) could continue to indulge in sweet-eating; they won it because the discovery of insulin, even it's most crude form at that time, enabled thousands of children and young adults to live with diabetes (type 1).The author's obvious distain for the \"insulin industry\" is an ignorant slap in the fact to every parent of every child who has type 1 diabetes. Over the years, insulin therapy for type 1 has become increasingly refined, and it is no longer necessary to suffer the extreme swings in blood glucose alluded to by the author, (as if Eli Lilly and Co. personally takes joy in the misery of people with diabetes).If you want to know the truth about insulin, you would do better to read \"The Discovery of Insulin\" by Michael Bliss.",

                "review/text": "I first read this book a year ago. I'll say this about it:Forget the indespensible information on the completely non-existent nutritional value of refined sugar. Forget the anecdotal mind-blowing gems like how mosquitos and other disease carrying insects fly past a recovered sugar addict's body because they are no longer attracted to what was once sweet smelling and tasting blood. Forget the paradigm shift his expose demands on the causes of a significant portion of all automobile accidents in this country. Forget his linking glucose intolerence to diseases--diagnosed, undiagnosed and falsely diagnosed over the centuries--from tooth decay to epilepsy to heart diesase to schizophrenia to lung cancer.Just ruminate on the historical facts brought out by this man that the hunger for refined sugar, and the subsequent addiction to this mind and body destroying chemical are the architects of:1) the African Slave trade in Europe and the Americas2)the disconnected and disjunct philosophies of mind and body health being separate entities in Western medicine (just now being gradually overturned) unlike everywhere else in world history3)\"Pagan\"/mental illness-related diseases of mythical, otherwise inexplicable derivation4) the chemical dependency supply-and-demand relationship and geo-political international trade structure that made everything from the decimation of Native American tribes and lands in the Americas to the drug corporations near dominance of today's American economy, to the Medellin and Sicilian cartels of heroin and cocaine *creating international public policy today* not just possible but INEVITABLE...In short, Mr. Dufty has written one of the most important books of this century, bar none. He has become a public servant to a level rivalling that of leaders and thinkers like Martin Luther, Charles Darwin, Martin Luther King.Hyperbole? Of course. But it's impossible not to get emotional about what this man shows us and teaches us. When you see how he puts together all the evidence, like the final moments of a Sherlock Holmes movie, and see how the mysterious pieces of the most tormented periods of both one's personal life and that of human history since the European Middle Ages fit together and relate, it will downright frighten you with its damning simplicity. Anyone who has been touched by alcoholism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, heart disease, depression, obesity, anorexia, drug addiction, diabetes; racism, religious intolerence, alcohol-, car accident- and drug-related crimes; co-dependency-related divorce, dysfunctional families; in short, every citizen of the Western World--which by political proxy is everyone in the world--will read this book and be changed, even if you do have a cup of cola again. I have never even come close to successfully getting rid of sugar in my diet. But the idea that I could change my life, health, soul and sense of the universe completely by achieving it is something that would absolutely never have occurred to me before hand.If that makes you say \"that sounds so *new agey* it makes me want to gag\", when you read SUGAR BLUES you'll realize it's the sugar talking!My favorite line from the movie THE USUAL SUSPECTS is \"The devil's greatest trick is making the world believe he doesn't exist.\" I think his real name is Fear; but maybe his real nickname...is Sugar.This book cannot just change lives, it has the power to change the world as we know it.",

                "review/text": "I love this book and I've read it many times in the last twenty-seven years. I actually am committed to not consuming sugar for the rest of my life. That being said, the majority of William Dufty's arguments against sugar are more than fallacious, they are completely unscientific. I've just purchased yet another copy of Sugar Blues to replace one that got lost in moving and I'm laughing out loud at how ridiculous his arguments are. Some of them include: Smoking tobacco doesn't cause cancer, it's the sugar in the cigarettes that does it. Smoking is actually better for you than eating candy. Eating protein or complex carbs with sugar causes \"fermentation\" in the GI tract, causing the formation of poisons, because digestion is solely reliant on enzymes. Ulcers are caused by eating sugar. Diabetes (he makes no distinction between Type I and Type II, which are completely different diseases and only share similar symptoms) can be treated (or even cured) completely by eating a macrobiotic diet of brown rice, sea vegetables, fish and umeboshi plum. His specific anecdote of George, the boy who contracts diabetes at 15 in the 1950s (presumably a juvenile diabetic) and is cured by eating a macrobiotic diet is absurd.Mr. Dufty's arguments make two things clear: that he had very little in the way of a scientific education and that this book is extremely dated in what science it refers to. Dufty has next to no understanding of how digestion takes place, no understanding that there are billions of bacteria and other organisms in the digestive system, that fermentation is a normal part of human digestion, that gastric motility has little do with sucrose. This book was written a decade before the discovery that ulcers are caused by a bacteria called Heliobacter pylori. A more significant problem for the polemic he proposes is his lack of understanding about carbohydrates in general. He believes that refined sugars alone are the sum evil of modernity and bizarrely believes that honey lacks all of the evils of refined sugar because it's \"natural\" when honey has only trace minerals and vitamins to recommend it over table sugar and contains high levels of fructose, which the body converts immediately to triglycerides. He claims over and over that none of the problems presented by eating refined sugars are present in whole grains despite the fact that a bite of whole grain bread that is chewed up and spat on glucose detecting paper registers as having as much glucose present as eating sucrose itself and similar effects on blood sugar levels.Dufty's claim is that all people and diabetics especially can do well on a high carbohydrate diet consisting of whole grains, principally brown rice. The glycemic index and the last 30 years have shown that is just not the case. Whole grains have vitamins and minerals but eventually, they all boil down nutritionally to starches and sugars and ironically, it's the USDA which Dufty labeled part of the \"diseasestablishment\" which is now pushing 11 servings of whole grains a day as the US population gets fatter and more diabetic every year. Dufty's obvious infatuation with Japanese culture and the macrobiotic diet explains his dietary advice. He must not have developed much insulin resistance in his lifetime to have been able to eat that way without it affecting him badly. The majority of us in the 21st century don't have that luxury any more. One wonders how theories of paleolithic diet would have registered with Mr. Dufty.Sugar is bad for us. All of us would be better off never eating sucrose again, without exception. That part William Dufty got right.",

                "review/text": "I cannot add much more to the positive reviews that indicate how the book clearly identifies the negative affects of sugar (and refined and processed foods, by extension) on the human body. The book delves into the detrimental developmental, mental/psychiatric, and physiological affects that sugar has on the human body. Just a few points that I would like to point out to potential readers of this book:(1.) Some of the very few negative reviews point out that the book is a one-track, narrowly focused diatribe against refined sugar (The author very clearly makes a distinction between natural carbohydrates and natural sugars as opposed to refined processed sugars and refined carbohydrates which is something that cannot be overlooked). I thoroughly disagree. There is a consistent and very powerful underlying theme throughout the book....the fact that throughout history the food industry and the medical/pharmaceutical industry have monetarily thrived off of each other at the expense of public health and human welfare. (and in my opinion, they knowingly did so and do so). This is not a conspiratorial left-winged angle on the theme of the book that the author pushes on the reader, but rather a theme that is supported throughout the European and American sugar history. The author uses this richly detailed historical backdrop to reinforce not only the perils and hazards of sugar, but to also provide perhaps an explanation (and motive) as to why and how refined sugar has become so pervasive in society. As is often the case, greed and monetary interests provide the very motives for the medical establishment's \"looking the other way\" in the face of overwhelming evidence pointing to the health hazards of sugar. The author leverages these historical actions effectively in telling the \"story\" and providing the facts. Admittedly, some of the facts are wholly anecdotal in nature, but nevertheless they serve the purpose to reinforce the overall theme of the book. At the core, this is the food industry \"lobbying\" for the pharmaceutical industry's interests, and vise versa. Consider this:1.Cholesterol free foods, fat free foods-----Cholesterol lowering drugs. Health issues: Good fats (fish oil, Omega 9's)totally eliminated. Absence of these fats induces cardiovascular problems. Cholesterol in and of itself is not damaging to arteries and endothelial function, but the absence healthy fats and statins cause a host of other cardiovascular issues.2.Polished refined white rice------Vitamin B1 derived from whole grain rice (they initially were able to market B1; there is no money to be made from B1 anymore so they have moved on). The author spends a chapter asking why was it removed in the first place? \"How to Complicate Simplicity\" all for the sake of money and greed.3.Refined sugar-------Psychiatry for a host of mental illnesses. Insulin. Allergy industry. All very profitable4.MSG, food additives--------Psychiatry and pharmaceuticals for a host of neurological disorders5.Transfatty acids for fat free food-------Cardiovascular and vascular medications to deal with the problems transfatty acids cause. Transfats were substituted for natural fats all in the name of low fat heart healthy foodstuffs! The food and pharmaceutical industries making money for each other.The pharmaceutical and established medical industry have one motive to look the other way when the perils of refined carbohydrates/sugars are discussed: Money and Greed. These \"foods\" supply their care industries with patients....\"How to complicate simplicity\"...(2.)One must also keep in mind that the book was written originally in 1976. Since then, many of the medical disease states presented in the book have been thoroughly researched, studied, and clinically proven to be caused by refined carbohydrates and sugars. Naysayers are the pharmaceutical industry and the processed food industry. Greed.(3.)The book in not meant to be a scientific double blind clinical study on the perils of refined sugar, but rather presents the reader with historical and anecdotal facts that point to one conclusion: the damaging effects of refined sugar on the human body and mind.(4.) Another negative review pointed out that carbohydrates are necessary for proper human metabolic function. The review incorrectly states that the book bears relevance only to people who are insulin resistant or diabetic. The whole point of the book is preventative food medicine. Once you are insulin resistant or diabetic, the damage has been done and is very difficult to reverse. The book points out that the fastest way to do the damage (to the adrenals, insulin receptive cells, pancreas, etc.)is through the consumption of refined sugar. The author (even way back in 1976) was also very clear to provide a distinction between processed refined carbohydrates (focusing on the worst of them, refined sugar) and natural carbohydrates (pure unrefined unpolished brown rice as opposed to processed refined polished white rice, for example). Natural carbs are an essential part of a well balanced diet.",

I mean doctors do wear white coats don't they?In other areas the author pushed it a little too hard in my opinion when he said a lot of \"unexplainable [car] accidents\" in which \"millions of American drivers\" may be driving under the influence or effect of sugar drowsiness (i.e. hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulin) when driving after a meal, especially after eating restaurant meals which is loaded with sugar. But who knows, it could be true and never has been investigated. Refined sugar is in nearly everything we eat nowadays.His decrying of sugar is similiar to Nancy Appleton's book, but I wouldn't take both of what they say lightly. The bottom line to me is another \"white\" food to avoid. That is; white sugar; white flour; white rice; white salt; and white milk (non-raw). All of these foods face extreme processing to lengthen their shelf life, but may end up shorting yours.",

I had given up sugar for a year (100%) about five years prior to reading this -- which is what prompted the interest. I had come to the realization that EVERYTHING had sugar in it and I proceeded to even make my own ketchup (with handy instructions from Weight Watchers -- in 1971 they were just a mere dot on the map with products only -- no advertising that I remember). I used to carry around their salad dressings so that I could eat out and still maintain my good nutritional habits.I continue to come across this book on my bookshelf, and have taken up to reading it again just to see what the inspiration was. Sugar still remains in my diet - removing it 100% now would be tough -- even though I have an excellent health and exercise regime. Now, at age 53, even though I still weigh the same and wear the same size clothes as I did 30 years ago, I am prepared to cut back again on the excess sugar....it becomes more difficult to maintain the weight and physique as time goes on, so removing excess sugar would be a beneficial thing to do right now for my 50+ year old body.Everyone who loves sugar, knows that once they start eating (candy, baked goods, etc.) -- i.e., beginning from Halloween and ending after Christmas, that their system seems to then REQUIRE more and more -- that suddenly eating candy (sugars) everyday becomes a staple diet item. I see it happen every year, if I don't make a CONSCIOUS decision at the end of summer to NOT get caught up in the cycle. That approach has worked for me -- just being constantly aware. However, after coming across another review here, I am going to read \"Get the Sugar Out...501 Ways....\" as it sounds like that's what is needed now for inspiration to continue on my path from 30 years ago. Removing all, or as much sugar as one can, from the diet, IS the ONE best way to maintain your weight and increase your energy for a lifetime. Recipes and short cuts really, really help get you started.",

Erstwhile lifetime friends--especially the generation of parents on both sides--the two families become bitter enemies when a father of one is killed by ETA militants, among them one of the sons of the other family.

Many accounts cover intimidation and lost jobs. But Maharidge doesn't stop there; he searches out and interviews both sides for their stories, which underneath have common threads.Maharidge digs deeper than the surface tensions of neo-conservatives versus liberals, to address the economic crisis that has been building in the country for the last 30 years; the emotions of which, September 11 catalyzed to the surface in deeply divided positions in America.The book is full of information, and reveals more controversial actions taken by the current administration after 9/11, such as the destroying of gun purchase records, (supported by the NRA) after the FBI had begun to find correlations to terrorists in the records.He sets to rights such misquotes as, \"my country, right or wrong.\" The correct quote, actually spoken by Carl Schurz, a U. S. Senator in 1899, goes: \"Our country, right or wrong. When right, to be kept right; when wrong, to be put right.\"In the last part of the book, Maharidge points out some parallels between the U.S. today, and W.W.II Germany, and actions taken by Hitler. While there are some similarities, he says the comparison is by no means exact, but it is worth taking note of.All in all an engrossing and educational read that peels back the layers of extremism dividing the country, to expose common struggles and concerns.",

                "review/text": "Dale Maharidge and Michael Williamson's \"Homeland\" is the best book of 2004, and one of the most important nonfiction works ever published about the United States.Maharidge travels through the United States observing the ways in which the attacks of 9/11/2001 have changed America and Americans. Many of these changes are obvious, but others are more subtle. With the seasoned eye of a trained reporter, Maharidge picks up on these changes and analyzes them with an amazing degree of insight. His conversations with ordinary Americans around the country reveal the different ways -- many of them downright scary -- in which the USA has changed over the last few years.Much of the book deals with neo-McCarthyism and the distressing willingness of many Americans to give up their constitutionally-protected freedoms after 9/11. Maharidge chronicles many recent attacks on the Bill of Rights by local governments, the federal government, and \"concerned citizens\" alike. He also details the ways in which the 9/11 attacks fueled the latent racism that many Americans feel toward Muslims, resulting in tragedies like the white mob that attacked a Chicago-area mosque on the evening after the attacks.Maharidge makes no secret of his left-wing perspective, but that doesn't mean this book is a political tract. On the contrary, he bends over backwards to be fair and non-judgmental toward the people he interviews, even when he's talking with white supremacists and other unsavory characters. Maharidge has his own opinion, but thankfully, he also has a genuine desire to understand events from the perspective of those who differ from him politically.Michael Williamson's photographs are also superb, as usual. Whether it's a telling shot of weary workers riding home in a subway car, or a shot of racist white motel owners trumpeting that their establishment is \"owned by Americans,\" Williamson's photos poignantly capture the America that exists today.This book takes you to places where the places mainstream media refuses to go, and covers issues that most so-called \"reporters\" would never touch with a 10-foot pole. With the 2004 election coming up, now is the most important time for Americans to understand and act upon the issues Maharidge discusses in this book. Do yourself a favor: If you read only one book this year, make it this one. Few more important works have ever been published.",

                "review/text": "I've read a handful of low carbohydrate books. This one is the LEAST informative and the MOST stuck in old dogma. It was written by a medical doctor, which explains the old school, keep-pushing-the-drugs dogma.Good Stuff: At least Rob has figured out that low carbohydrate diets are very beneficial. He's also in favor of aerobic exercise. But other low carbohydrate books are much more cutting edge and helpful. I'll list the ones I know at the end of this missive. He's also in favor of statin drugs, which could seriously damage your health. Read on!Background Intel: When I chat with regular people, I quickly out pace them because they don't have any solid body of knowledge to compare against all the nutritional misinformation that's currently circulating. And with most people, they've learned five or six wrong ideas about cholesterol or exercise and they just recite those wrong ideas like they're mantras. Even when I give them helpful information that could definitely improve their health, with studies and books to back it up, they still cling to the old ideas. They argue to be sick and ignorant. It's very rare that I meet an adult over the age of 20 who is willing to learn anything new, particularly when it's something to do with nutrition.Your average doctor knows NOTHING about nutrition, diabetes, osteoporosis or heart disease. Medical students sit through 3,000 hours of lectures. Out of those 3,000 hours, most of them receive exactly zero hours of training in nutrition. They can take elective classes in nutrition, but those classes just cover the same old, wrong misinformation that has been proven wrong by the studies and books I've read. What they do learn is anatomy and how to identify symptoms and prescribe various drugs to treat those symptoms. They do not learn how to stay healthy or to treat illnesses with methods that don't involve drugs.My friend Dana once asked ten medical students why they wanted to become doctors. All ten of them replied, \"To get rich.\" No one said - To help people.For more on this, check out: What Your Doctor Doesn't Know About Nutritional Medicine May Be Killing You by Doctor Raymond Strand.And this article by Doctor Joseph Mercola: Doctors Are The Third Leading Cause Of Death In The US, Killing 225,000 People Every YearIn which he lists:All these are deaths per year:* 12,000 -- unnecessary surgeries* 7,000 -- medication errors in hospitals* 20,000 -- other errors in hospitals* 80,000 -- infections in hospitals* 106,000 -- non-error, negative effects of drugsThese total to 225,000 deaths per year from iatrogenic causes!!What does the word iatrogenic mean? This term is defined as induced in a patient by a physician's activity, manner, or therapy. Used especially of a complication of treatment.- - - - - - - - - - - -Stuff Doctor Thompson Got Wrong:He thinks you need a custom diet:There are people with food allergies and it's even more important for people with diabetes or hypoglycemia to avoid sugar than the rest of the crowd. But you don't need a special diet based on your blood type or your DNA.The field of genetics has morphed into the new field of epigenetics. Epigenes are switches that turn genes on and off. Your epigenes play a role in how your body handles your diet, but your genes are one of many factors.You can't eat lots of pasta, doughnuts, bread, pizza, cover your salad with salad dressing that's loaded with corn syrup, wash it all down with a 32 ounce soft drink and then blame your hefty weight and diabetes on your genes. People in families with many overweight members are mainly overweight because they eat the same sugary, starchy junk food. And they all sit on the couch, watching television and playing video games. There certainly is a genetic factor, but your diet is the main thing. What are you eating three times a day? On a beautiful, summer evening, are you going for a walk or watching television?He thinks saturated fats make one gain weight:This is another old bit of dogma. First of all, eating fats does not make you fat.The journalist Henry Louis Mencken wrote, \"For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.\" The idea that eating fat makes you fat is clear, simple and wrong.Here's a telling example which appears in the article - On The First Law Of Thermodynamics, written by Barry Groves, PhD:Actually, excess fats aren't stored in the body. Any unused fat calories are excreted in urine and feces. (Endocrinology 1962; 70: 579. Experientia 1963; 19: 319. Metabolism 1964; 13: 87-97. Proc Soc Exp Biol Med 1964; 115:424. Nature 1964; 201: 924)You can eat all the natural animal fats you want. The idea that eating fat makes you fat is, quite literally, crap. You're body just excretes any excess fats that it doesn't need. It's sugar, corn syrup and starches that make you fat, not meat.You're better off eating grass fed beef from cows that eat their natural diet, grass, and spend their time in the sunshine. In factory farms cows eat an unnatural diet of grains, plus their injected with hormones and antibiotics. The grains cause ulcers to grow in the cows' stomachs. Eventually, the ulcers would kill the cows, but they don't live long enough for that to happen. That's another huge topic.There are two ways to lose weight:1 - Starve yourself. This is also called a low fat diet. It's not healthy and it's no fun at all.2 - Restrict insulin. Insulin is the gatekeeper. As long as insulin is high, it prevents triglycerides from being used for fuel. When insulin is low, a process called lipolysis-ketosis begins. Triglycerides are taken from the adipose cells (the fat cells) and burned for fuel.This is usually called ketosis for short and it's completely natural. Unfortunately, the name is similar to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a dangerous condition for diabetics, resulting from a shortage of insulin. So many people, including many doctors, confuse the two and will tell you that ketosis is dangerous.On the contrary, you're in ketosis every night while you sleep. If it were not for ketosis, you would use up all your glycogen, your short term energy storage, and die in your sleep. Since you can't eat while you're sleeping, your body converts some triglycerides (body fat) to glucose while you sleep to keep your body and brain running.Fruit:He says you can eat all the fruit you want. He doesn't understand that fruit is loaded with fructose. It's not as harmful as mainlining sugar, but you don't want to go overboard with fruit. And if you're trying to lose weight, eating more than a little fruit will sabotage your weight loss efforts.His glucose shock rating:Where did that come from? He has a chart with the glucose shock ratings of various foods. It's the first time I've seen this. Everyone else uses the glycemic index. (It's a young field, so the values for various foods are still being sorted out. That's how it goes with young fields.)Exercise:His advice about exercise is incredibly vague!He did write that exercise helps reduce triglycerides before they are stored as fat. Well done there. But then he wrote that, \"High triglyceride levels wash away HDL, the good cholesterol.\" He added no explanation for that statement.He suffers from the HDL is good cholesterol and LDL is bad cholesterol myth:HDL is high density lipoprotein and LDL is low density lipoprotein. These are special molecules, from a class of molecules called lipoproteins, that move things around in your body, including cholesterol. HDL and LDL are not cholesterol; they are the vehicles that move cholesterol around. Calling HDL good cholesterol is like looking at a school bus and saying, \"You're a 3rd grade student.\"It's right there in the name, high density lipoprotein. The word cholesterol does not appear anywhere. It's amazing how so many people can miss something so obvious.LDL takes cholesterol to the cells. HDL takes it away from the cells, back to the liver. The thinking was that taking cholesterol away from the cells must be good and taking it to the cells must be bad. Another bit of wrong thinking.On top of that, only 20 percent to 33 percent of the cholesterol in your body comes from the food you eat. Your liver makes the rest. If you eat fewer foods with cholesterol, your livers makes more. If you eat lots of foods with cholesterol, your liver makes less. The amount of cholesterol you eat has only a negligible effect or no effect on the amount of cholesterol in your blood.He thinks cholesterol clogs your arteries:Here's an idea is from Doctor Ron Rosedale:Your liver is not going to make a molecule that's harmful, then make another class of molecules to move it around, then transport that molecule into your arteries and smear it all over your artery walls to give you a heart attack. Nature does not work that way.The idea that cholesterol clogs your arteries and leads to heart disease is a complete myth. It was created by Professor Ancel Keys, at the University of Minnesota, in the 1950s. He could have blamed heart disease on sugar or animal fats. He picked animal fats. He was wrong. He was supposed to do a regression analysis to check his hypothesis. Any researcher worth eight bits knows how to do a regression analysis. (I changed that expression for the computer age.) He never did that.Tribal people who still eat a high fat diet, such as the Masai in Africa, don't get heart disease. Unless the Masai move to a big city and eat modern foods, including starch and sugar. Then they do get heart disease.But many American runners, who run several miles a day, and eat a typical American diet full of sugar and starch, do get heart disease. Most notably, the famous runner Jim Fixx died of a heart attack.In the early 1900s, Americans were eating massive amounts of meat and lard. Heart disease was virtually unknown. The first study of heart disease was done in 1912, and there were only four cases!Herrick, J.B. \"Clinical features of sudden obstruction of the coronary arteries,\" Journal of the American Medical Association, 1912, LIX, page 2105.One side effect of low cholesterol is depression, and even suicide! There's an old picture from the 1950s which shows a happy family of four. They're outside, smiling happily. The caption reads, \"They're happy because they eat lard!\" Yes, natural animal fats are important brain foods, and they help maintain a pleasant mood.From the article - Role of Diet in Depression, Suicide and Violence by Barry Groves PhD:If your cholesterol is too low -- that is below about 4.42 mmol/L (170 milligrams/deci-liter) your risk of mood disorders, depression, stroke, and violence is increased. During trials to lower levels of cholesterol in the blood, it became obvious that there was a tendency towards more suicides and violent deaths in the treatment groups. In 1991 Canadian investigators examined this trend.[4] Adjusting for age and sex, they found that those whose cholesterol was below 4.27 were 6 times more likely to attempt suicide that those with cholesterol above 5.77.This was confirmed by a study conducted at the Psychiatric Clinic, Charles University of Prague.[5] Patients in this study who had attempted a violent suicide had significantly lower cholesterol levels than patients with non-violent attempts and the control subjects. The authors say 'Our findings . . . are consistent with the theory that low levels of cholesterol are associated with increased tendency for impulsive behaviour and aggression and contribute to a more violent pattern of suicidal behaviour.' They conclude 'These data indicate that low serum total cholesterol level is associated with an increased risk of suicide.'[4]. Ellison LF, Morrison HI. Low serum cholesterol concentration and risk of suicide. Epidemiology 2001; 12: 168-72.[5]. Vevera J, Zukov I, Morcinek T, Papezova H. Cholesterol concentrations in violent and non-violent women suicide attempters. Eur Psychiatry 2003; 18: 23-7.Statins:He's also in favor of statin drugs and any other drugs he can push. Cholesterol is ONLY good for you. You don't want to reduce production of cholesterol. That will only harm you.Side Effects:Statin drugs reduce the production of cholesterol and coenzyme Q10, which helps your muscles work. Cholesterol helps your memory work, so a quick side effect of statin drugs is a very poor memory.From the article - Permanent Side Effects From Statin Drugs by Michael Graveline, MD MPHToday, with more potent drugs, millions of people taking them and at doses triple and quadruple those of the past, the side effect profile has radically changed. Now, cognitive damage, emotional and behavioral change, neuropathies and even neuro-degenerative damage are increasingly recognized as associated with statin drug use. But there is something even more perverse - the element of permanence of some of these consequences....And the same for neuromuscular - yes, most of the drug companies now admit that peripheral neuropathy may be a consequence of statin use but have never mentioned it might be disabling, crippling or permanent....Michael Hope was one of the first to receive widespread media attention - a former CEO reduced to unemployable status due to persistent loss of short-term memory. Today, four years after the onset, Michael is still grossly impaired. He is one of many hundreds who have persistent cognitive deficits long after stopping their statin.Next came reports of muscle aches and pains brought on by statin drugs that persisted and even worsened despite promptly stopping the statin. Two astronaut friends of mine, having no history of muscle problems, experienced muscle pains shortly after their statin was started for mild hypercholesterolemia. Much to their dismay these pains have persisted years after they stopped the offending drug. They are but two of thousands of people in this growing subgroup with persistent and apparently permanent muscle symptoms seemingly triggered by statin drug use. Current research indicates that many of these have an unsuspected genetic predisposition. Some of these cases respond to CoQ10, many do not....Tau protein is now known to promote the formation of neuro-fibrillatory tangles with secondary neuronal damage, offering a possible explanation for the unusual number of cases we are seeing of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinsonism, frontal lobe dementia and Alzheimers' disease and other neurodegenerative conditions shortly after statins are started. This suggests that these diseases are somehow being triggered by statins. Need I add that these diseases are both permanent and progressive.- - - - - - - - - - - -A study done at Nottingham University, and published in the British Medical Journal, confirmed these side effects for statin drugs: muscle weakness, cataracts, acute kidney failure and moderate or severe liver dysfunction.Rob did not mention any drug side effects. There's no telling how much harm he's caused his patients. Nutrition is a complex field. Unfortunately, his thinking is far too simple to make the necessary connections between diet, insulin, aerobic exercise, cholesterol, heart disease and the wealth of insight available from our hunter gatherer ancestors and the various tribes around the world who are still eating their native diets.The Other Reviews:It was disappointing, but not surprising, to see several favorable reviews for such a poorly researched and potentially harmful book. But, as I wrote, most Americans know nothing about nutrition. So if you're eating 180 pounds of sugar, suffering the consequences, you can't see your abdominal muscles or last through an hour long Kung Fu class, and you have a nutritional knowledge base of zero, then this book might seem like a ray of sunshine.On the contrary, this book is the worst of the low carbohydrate bunch. If you follow the advice in this book, you'll only hold yourself back and your health will suffer. Yes, cutting down the sugar and exercising is a good start, but those are the only two things he got sort of right. And he still said it's okay to cheat on the sugar.If you don't believe me, answer this question: What does glucagon do? If you don't know, you don't understand the biochemistry involved with burning fat. Go do some real research. Glucagon is also not mentioned in Rob's book. That's one more thing that he missed or got wrong.Summary:I recommend that you don't read this book. He did try, but there are so many things he got wrong. He's too much in the dogma of the medical establishment. American doctors are trained to identify symptoms and write prescriptions. Plus there are 80,000 drug representatives pushing the doctors to write even more prescriptions.Doctors are NOT trained in nutrition or exercise or what really causes heart disease, diabetes, attention deficit disorder or osteoporosis. To build and maintain your health, you must gather your own information, do your own reading and think for yourself. So many people refuse to think for themselves or to read a book that challenges what they think is true. They put their faith in the so called experts. They're the ones who are dying from medication errors and the negative effects of drugs in Doctor Mercola's article.As Thomas Edison said, \"There is no expedient to which a man will not go to avoid the labor of thinking.\"The Good Books:A book with many studies, peer reviewed, yada yada, about why cholesterol and saturated fats are not the bad guys that they're made out to be: Fat And Cholesterol Are Good For You by Swedish Doctor Uffe Ravnskov.A splendid explanation of the low carb lifestyle: Living Low Carb: Controlled-Carbohydrate Eating For Long-Term Weight Loss by Jonny Bowden, PhD CNS.How I Gave Up My Low-Fat Diet And Lost 40 Pounds by Dana Carpender, a bit dated but she gives you the basic intel on low carb living, generous quantities of helpful advice on diet and exercise and she has a chatty, easy to read style.Life Without Bread: How A Low-Carbohydrate Diet Can Save Your Life by Christian Allan and Wolfgang LutzAnd a fine book on why you DON'T want to eat cereal for breakfast, Cereal Killer by Alan Watson.I wish you the best of health!

While promising low carb and tipping his hat to Dr. Atkins, this book is squarely moderate carb.There are many internal inconsistencies and inaccuracies in this book. For example (page 131) \"In Western countries, the only[italicized in original]good source of insoluble fiber is the husk of the wheat kernel, called bran.\" The Harvard School of Public Health states that insoluble fiber can also be found in seeds. Flax seed has 3g of fiber per tablespoon, 2 of which is insoluble, and virtually no other carbohydrate. Wheat bran has only 1.5 grams of fiber per tablespoon and almost another gram of other carbohydrate.Dr. Thompson is also contradictory in his advice about dietary cholesterol. He says that dietary cholesterol does not significantly affect blood cholesterol (p.46, p.146). Yet, when giving dietary advice, he advocates avoiding egg yolks on the same page! (p. 146)I am concerned by his enthusiastic use of statins as the only means to control blood cholesterol. He mentions no side effects. On the other hand, he goes to great pains to point out the potential side effects of aspirin.If you are looking for a dietary answer, I'd suggest The South Beach Diet by Dr. Agaston as a far superior work.",

                "review/text": "In 1947 Edward Dmytryk, a rising young director of such films as \"Murder, My Sweet\" and \"Crossfire,\" along with 11 other Hollywood writers and executives, was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee, known to history as HUAC. HUAC's stated purpose for calling these 12 men was to expose the corrupting presence of communists in the entertainment industry and, it hoped, bar them from further employment in Hollywood. Ten, the famous Hollywood Ten, did indeed testify, were found in contempt of congress for their unwillingness to fully cooperate with the House committee and were duly punished for their intransigence. Subsequent to his appearance before congress in 1947, Dmytryk was sentenced to spend six months in a minimum security federal facility.\"Odd Man Out\" is Dmytryk's story of that time. It is a unique story. Most if not all of the people who were banned by the HUAC influenced Hollywood blacklists were indeed communists, or had joined the party at some point in the past. As Dmytryk writes, naming names was the ultimate sin. And, although \"HUAC was out to expose a movement rather than nail a tiny group of individuals, and in that, however illegal, unethical, and un-American it was, they obviously succeeded,\" the blacklisted individuals were supposed to maintain a united front. After prison and a couple of years in the wilderness, though, Dmytryk had a change of heart. Never a True Believer, it seems, it became obvious to him \"the Ten had been sacrificed to the Party's purpose as a pipeline for the Comintern's propaganda... and ... if I were going to be a martyr, I wanted the privilege of choosing my martyrdom, and making my family suffer to protect the American representatives of a foreign agency would certainly not be it.\" And so, as a condition for reinstatement, in 1951 Dmytryk testified again for HUAC, this time as a friendly witness.Time has exposed the communist witchhunt as a dark blemish on America's record, and those who were blacklisted have become noble martyrs. Dmytryk started out a hero but became the turncoat villain in this story. His second testimony in 1951, even though he named no new names, was never completely forgiven. Towards the end of the book Dmytryk recounts an encounter with another blacklisted director, Jules Dassin, who refused to share a stage with him and yet felt free to excoriate him during a round-table discussion of the blacklist era. Dassin's reaction wasn't untypical, and even today the blacklisted individuals are revered without quarter. Save for the turncoat Dmytryk, who, unfortunately, was forced to deal with the devil and testify against his former friends and denounce his past involvement in the communist party in America. \"Odd Man Out\" convinced me that he did the right thing, and reminded me that history is rarely a clear-cut matter of Right and Wrong. If you're interested in a different perspective on this difficult time I strongly recommend this book.",

I applaud Dr. McDougall's work in, and emphasis on, preventive medicine. He shows a person how to take control of their own health. You don't have to be sick. You don't have to be a victim of genetics or the victim of the pathology-based symptom-treating medical community. I loaned the book to a friend a number of years ago when he was experiencing chest pains and was scheduled for angioplasty. He declined the angioplasty, changed his diet, and has not had chest pains again. He then loaned it to a friend who had had a massive heart attack - his friend changed his lifestyle, too. I wish Dr. McDougall would revise and update the book to include his writings on other health problems that can be treated with a change in lifestyle - e.g., depression and multiple sclerosis.",

Each chapter focuses on a different disease. Dr. McDougall explains how the standard medical approach treats only the symptoms, but not the causes, of such chronic diseases. He then demonstrates (with extensive references to the scientific literature) how a low-fat diet based primarily on vegetables, fruits, grains, and legumes can help to prevent and/or cure these diseases. This book was published in 1986, but it remains both valid and useful today. (Indeed, it seems like every day another scientific study is published demonstrating the importance of eating a mostly plant-based diet.) The only slight drawback is that the book does not give much information about the practical implementation of the eating plan. (For readers interested in such information, I would recommend &quot;The McDougall Plan&quot; and &quot;The McDougall Program: 12 Days to Dynamic Health.&quot;)",

I checked out a medical research book entitled 'Cholesterol'. All of the information McDougall cited on cholesterol is in that book, written in the 1960's. This is one of the oldest medical stories in the USA and the Atkins fanatics are still trying to start a meat religion. The best conclusion is that Atkins collapsed and died of congestive heart failure while obese and his family covered it up claiming he fell accidentally and then got pumped with fluid in the hospital. No, sorry. The Atkins propaganda machine may be going strong but the diet will kill you.",

(We are an immigrant nation, after all.) To argue that people who had no part whatsoever in slavery are morally responsible requires such intellectual contortions as would confound any psychologist.

Horowitz began his battle by formulating &quot;Ten Reasons Why Reparations for Slavery Is A Bad Idea--And Racist, Too&quot; and sent it to 71 college newspapers nationwide in the form of an advertisement. The first half of the book deals mainly with reaction to the ad on college campuses. Horowitz details the reaction of university student newspaper editors, profeessors and administrators at places such as UC Berkeley, The University of Wisconsin at Madison, and Brown University. Here, Horowitz tells a chilling, frightening account of the kind of censorship attempted by the far left-of-center campus &quot;commisars&quot;. This section is an eye-opener for those who still believe that our American universities are centers for the free exchange of ideas. The section on Brown University, and the lengths that some of the students would go to to suppress the ad is particularly disturbing.The last sections of the book are mainly devoted to the idea of reaparations for slavery itself. The idea itself has been floating around for many years, but has gained monmentum in the last decade due to the publication of the bestselling book &quot;The Debt&quot; by black activist Randall Robinson as well as the formal adoption of the reparations concept by the city councils of several US population centers including Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas. Horowitz gives a reasoned,well-researched refutation of the reaparations concept which leaves one wondering what the folks populating the campi were worried about. Could they be afraid of the truth? Buy this book. It is an essential part of the debate on an issue that will continue to be part of the American landscape, and a revelation to those who seek the truth.",

What we have here is a book that details the sociology of radical left student activists--demonstrating how little these people care either about ideas or the truth or even common decency. Their hatred of American society is only rivalled by their absolute insistence that they never be criticized or challenged. They are against the Open Society as such and pretend to be \"offended\" if anyone questions their twisted ideals. Despite being among some of the most privileged individuals in the history of the human race, attending expensive colleges where they are catered to by an indulgent administration, they never cease complaining about how oppressed they are and the horrors of the \"white establishment\" that \"rules\" America. They have no sense of history or the human condition. They believe merely what they wish to believe--and God forbid if anyone should try to shake them from their dogmatic slumbers!Their attempts to silence Horowitz's campaign against reparations would rate as first-rate farce if it were not so pathetic and disturbing. Not only did not one radical leftist attempt to refute all of Horowitz's ten arguments against reparations, not one demonstrated that even understood any of Horowitz's arguments. The radical Left's fanatical ideology prevents these poor children of darkness from being able to understand what they read--a huge problem for American intellectuals, especially those on the Left. It never occurs to these individuals that the goal of reading is to understand what someone else is trying to say, in order that one may learn from that person and be challenged by him. But these people have no interest in learning.This is a widespread problem among American intellectuals. This was clear to me when I was doing the research for a book critical of Ayn Rand. Neither Rand nor her followers seemed to me capable of reading. They inevitably twisted everything they read that disagreed with their point of view, giving it a malicious interpretation. (Of course, if anyone misinterpreted anything Rand said, they would howl with indignation.) But in comparison with these radical leftists, Rand appears a very model of fair-mindedness. At least Rand and her followers pretend to respect logic and rational argument. These leftists, as described by Horowitz, don't even offer the merest pretense of logic or respect for rational argument. Horowitz's arguments against reparations, which most Americans would agree with, they dismiss as \"offensive\" and \"racist,\" and that's as far as they go in the direction of rational argument. Some students reported weeping because their feelings were so badly hurt! If these students really are that hyper-sensitive (rather than merely histrionic), how do they expect to make it in the real world, where no one will have any indulgence for such absurdities? I fear that these radical leftists will be in for a hard time of it when they leave the shelter of the university. Such are the consequences of adopting an ideology so contrary to fact, so belligerently opposed to the demands of everyday life.",

My ancestors fought for the Union in the Civil War and I don't feel that I should have to pay for reparations to slaves that my family fought to free (and never owned), especially when viewed in the overall scheme of the history of slavery in the world and where the U.S. slave trade fits in. And what of the immigrants after the Civil War who had nothing to do with it? But I don't want to spend too much time on the individual points.What disgusted me the most of all the information in this book was the state of our colleges today. They are supposed to be open to all points of view, to teach our children to accept and debate and decide on their own. Instead it seems from this book that univerity administration, faculty and even students are shutting down the free flow of ideas in favor of political correctness. This book should make every adult think about how universities are teaching our children. What happened to the open debates of the past? Why is information now being censored? What kind of future society might this create? Questions at this point left unanswered but they certainly need addressed. This country was founded on freedoms, an important one was the right to disagree with someone's statement and to argue it, without repercussions for your opinions. This seems to have vanished at our college's.Granted, this question is creating many hard feelings in the U.S. right now. Many blacks from varied backgrounds are pushing for reparations and many whites are afraid to discuss such controversial issues for the fear of being labeled racist. A sad truth in our society today is the fact that at the initial point of any disagreement involving black and white the racist label flies out too quickly and too broadly.This book should be read not only by people interested in forming an opinion on reparations but by anyone who would like to know the state of our college's today.",

We are told by much of today's commentators that we have not come very far in this fight and how white America is still oppressing their neighbors with tenacious, overt hatred. And this despite the fact that most American's today identify with a much more egalitarian American society. Horowitz's book poses a succinct, common sense argument against reparations for slavery.

Horowitz does a good job of covering them in detail. The idea that all US blacks today are owed huge sums of money for slavery some of their ancestors suffered is certain to be controversial. Basically, reparations supporters are saying, \"Whites owe blacks money for something they themselves never did and which never happened to any black alive today.\" Truly, truly bizarre. The sad thing is that many gullible, poorly educated people fall for this scam and support the racketeers who are trying to run it on the rest of us.Perhaps the most interesting part of Horowitz's book is the portion where he describes the vicious racism, hatred and hypocrisy he faced for even wanting to discuss the topic of reparations. His descriptions of how the minds of many reparations supporters seemed hermetically sealed against reason, logic and common sense were absolutely chilling.As a black man myself, I consider this book to be a valuable look at the sociology of race in the US today, as well as an appeal by Horowitz for an end to racism and divisiveness.

Participation was co-opted in part by lack of resources, and also by economic pressures. The threat of exit was effectively used by corporations that did not want to be subjected to restrictions on polluting activities. Business leaders quashed activism on the grounds that precious jobs would be lost. It was not until the 1990's that African-Americans became more involved.Initially, the environmental movement was populated by the more affluent white American who seemed to be more concerned with the preservation of nature and clean space for leisure activities. Other motivations were less clear, and emerged with the maturity of the movement. Bullard details this history well.

                "review/text": "Robert Bullard, through his work Dumping in Dixie, calls to question the complex and controversial issue of environmental racism. He argues that African-Americans and minorities are being denied and stripped of a safe and healthy environment. Americans in certain areas, particularly low-income and minority families, are bearing the brunt of hazardous wastes and poisonous substances. Factories and corporations are choosing certain areas where they know that they can avoid pollution laws due to the current plight of the neighborhood. As a result, people in these low-income communities are suffering all the consequences of these corporations and receiving none of the economic benefits. Bullard emphasizes that the environmental movement did not resonate and take root in low-income communities, and therefore, there is a significant discrepancy in environmental threats and government protection between whites and minorities. Due to a lack of resources, mainly education and income, environmental racism exists in certain parts of America.I feel as though Robert Bullard calls awareness to a very relevant and noteworthy issue in American society. Although he only uses a few small towns in his arguments, the fact that these issues exist anywhere is disturbing. Environmental justice did not resonate in disadvantaged areas, and the corporations and government are showing absolutely no regard for the people in these communities. People and places cannot be sacrificed, and something must definitely be done to prevent this obvious racism and discrimination.In terms of his main arguments, I completely agree with Robert Bullard. He does an excellent job of raising a very significant issue. Many people do not even think about the evils of society, especially environmental racism. I did not even consider the innocent people and communities that were being harmed by these factories and corporations. Bullard's absolutely right, people are disadvantaged, and are oblivious to the environmental racism that exists and what can be done to stop it. By calling awareness to these problems and most importantly educating people on this issue, positive strides will be taken to eliminate this racism.I thought that Bullard did a great job using tables to illustrate his data and further support his arguments. Although at times I found the work to be a bit data intense, the tables did a great job reinforcing the inequalities in environmental threats and government protection. Along the same lines, I felt that the different surveys and representative samples that were used gave his argument even more momentum and significance. The case studies that were used really added to the work, and did a good job of applying Bullard's beliefs to real life situations.In addition to the fact that Bullard used too much data that sometimes slowed the read down, I felt that his emphasis on just the South may have detracted from his point a little. Although I understand that the South has been home to a majority of the African-American population, but it would have helped his argument to focus on at least one town in the north, whether it was white or black. I do not think that this emphasis completely destroyed his argument, but it is one critique of his work that I do feel is justified.Overall, however, I thought that Dumping in Dixie was a very intellectually engaging and stimulating work that will make me think about environmental racism. The history of the environmental movement has a great impact on everyone in the world, and action must be taken to prevent these environmental discrepancies from occurring now and in the future.",

Victor Davis Hanson, known for his military histories and his social commentary, is a fifth-generation Californian who lives on a family farm in the Central Valley and has written eloquent elegies on the decline of agrarianism, Fields Without Dreams and The Land Was Everything. Here too, he ponders what has changed in California over the past quarter century, examining how the state and the Southwest more broadly-indeed, the entire nation-have been altered by hemorrhaging borders. Hanson admires the ambition and vigor of immigrants who have helped make California strong, but he indicts the disordered immigration policies that led to the present mess. He also illuminates the ways those policies are harmful to people who have come from Mexico and Central America seeking a better life in the United States. Nearly twenty years after the first publication of Mexifornia, Hanson offers an update on the continuing tragedy of illegal immigration. At the same time, he remains hopeful that our traditions of integration, assimilation, and intermarriage may yet remedy a predicament created by politicians and ideologues.",

                "review/text": "I thought the book was interesting and would recommend it to anyone to read but for several reasons I cannot give it more than 3 stars. First I'll tell you something about myself, I have lived on the border for over 20 years and I work as an immigration enforcement officer. I consider myself as much an expert on immigration as the author.I enjoyed the book for several reasons and recommend it because of them. The book is shorter than I would have expected. Most anti-immigration books tend to be racist but I never got that feeling from this book. I thought that the chapter on the Universe of the Illegal Alien was excellent. If you don't live in the southwest, this will give you a good idea of the immigrant's life.I agree with the author that one of the major problems now with immigration is that Mexican immigrants no longer want to or feel the need to assimilate to the American lifestlye. This is caused by the huge illegal alien influx and possibly several liberal judicial decisions. The author does an very good job of describing the effect of illegal immigration but errs in his describtion of the cause.The author makes two major errors on the causes of illegal immigration. He places most of the blame on what he calls the \"liberal elite\" and only briefly mentions the right. This is a huge error. If you want to find the greatest accelerant of illegal and legal immigration, you would find it to be the IRCA 86. The bill granting amnesty to illegal aliens was passed in 1986 by Reagan and a Republican Senate. This is especially relevent considering that this book was written post 9/11 and President Bush had already made public his intentions for another anmesty. The omission of it is incredible. The bill intended to grant citizenship to about 3 million illegal aliens but in turn granted citizenship or permanent residence to at least 15 to 20 million immigrants.The author also errs in in underestimating the effect of racism on hispanics and other minority group. To think that racism doesn't play a part is ridiculous. Also, the author would also use statistics and not mention any source that they came from. For example, he may say something like 40% of illegal aliens cannot read but he doesn't mention where he got that statistic from.",

From the hoplites of ancient Greece, the farming crisis of the 80's, the history of warfare and culture, the teaching of the classics and now this searching analysis of the debacle of our non-policy on immigration, I have been astonished at how skillfully this man writes and with what intelligence he cuts to the essence of whatever subject he addresses. In the present book Hanson turns his gaze to a subject he is personally familiar with: the transformation of his native California by massive illegal immigration from Mexico. Hanson is not anti-Mexican. He has several Mexican relatives, his daughters are dating Mexican-Americans and most of the people he grew up with are Mexican-American or Mexican. What Hanson is opposed to is our feckless non-policy on immigration which allows steady waves of illegals to flood our border states and does not give us time to allow us to assimilate the Mexican immigrants here. Hanson believes strongly that the vast majority of immigrants, given time and opportunity, will assimilate and become good citizens. However it is impossible for this to be accomplished unless we gain control of our southern border and curb most illegal immigration. A timely book on a major issue that both the Republican and Democrat parties steadfastly ignore.",

                "review/text": "First, off, Hanson is a classical liberal, and he states he is a Democrat. The problem is, whenever you question the \"party line\" in the U.S. that mass, uncontrolled immigration is the only way, you are often labeled a \"racist\" or \"nativist\". This book is not anti-Mexican, it is pro-sustainability. The book is actually compassionate. Hanson states that many of the students he teaches are Mexican, and he likes Mexicans. But the point is not, do we like Mexicans, the point is, when does a society or a state reach the point at which immigration is no longer sustainable (to use a term that liberals love). Hanson's point is that that point is already reached. All you have to do is see the overpopulation of California. The 17 % of U.S. prisoners who are illegal immigrants. The ambulance services forced to go bankrupt in Arizona, because federal law mandates that they treat illegals, but federal law does not require the govnment to pay for it (!) [by the way, I am for such treatment, because it is the only humane way, but we also have to remember that someone pays for it]. Spiralling crime in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California. State after state - including Democrat-run states like New Mexico and Virginia, declaring states of emergency because of the chaos of mass, uncontrolled immigration. Even Hillary Clinton and other liberals are now admitting, enough is enough. In the city where I live (Dallas), our schools now mostly teach illegals, and there are signs outside the schools in Spanish stating, \"Become a U.S. citizen \" (!). Crime is way up in Dallas, as it is throughout the southwest. Texas builds more and more highways and more and more housing to try to cope with the population explosion. The state is now a \"majority-non-white\" state, like California. Texas never solved the issue of dire poverty, and yet, we are now taking on masses of very poor people, all in the name of dubious \"diversity\" (when is there enough \"diversity\" ?), and cheap labor, so that we can get our cars washed and our hedges trimmed, dirt cheap. Sure, immigration has its positive side (an infusion of young people, with their energy, people willing to work hard, etc.), but the general trend has been negative, with social and environmental standards eroding over time, and Hanson does a good job of portraying that.",

                "review/text": "As one who shares the author's ethnic,cultural and geographical heritage, I thought Hanson did a marvelous job of assessing California's major social issue, and one of America's primary problems. Like Hanson, I was born and reared in Fresno County, albeit some 25 miles from his native Selma. I can attest to the accuracy of his description of Selma and the Central Valley in the 1950's.As a child, my associates included Hispanics; as a teenager working in the fig and peach orchards, my fellow workers were Hispanic. During my professional career, I have hired and promoted many Hispanics.Hanson's Scandinavian ancestors (from Sweden) and mine (from Denmark) came to America legally and without speaking English, but they succeeded--without bilingual classes, welfare, government subsidies, or that phenomenon known as &quot;affirmative action&quot;, which is being rapidly unmasked as nothing, more or less, than &quot;reverse discrimination&quot;. Hanson deftly exposes the race industry as an amalgam of organizations and individuals who are quick to attack the Anglo for any slight, either real or imagined, but who, in the long run, seem not to do much for those whom they purport to serve.As a criminologist, I am well aware of the violence committed by Hispanic Gangs, and the fact that those gangsters who do not wind up in the morgue soon become expensive inmates in our overcrowded prison system, costing taxpayers some $25k per year each. I am equally aware of the many outstanding Hispanic officers, prosecutors, and judges with whom I've worked.Hanson has eloquently described the failure of our educational programs to work toward an assimilated America, as well as the failure of the &quot;separatists&quot; in the race industry.The one failure which, to my surprise, he did not identify is that of our elected officials who establish public policy. When Hanson and I were youngsters/young men in the Central Valley, the politicians seemed to act in the best interests of their constituencies. Today,by and large, our politicians have little integrity, but rather pander incessantly to special interests which, in turn, provide them with campaign funds, endorsements,and precinct workers.It is common knowledge that, in Sacramento, legislative votes are &quot;for sale&quot; almost daily. Until we can restore some integrity among our public officials, we will not move toward a better California--better for Hispanics, Anglos, African Americans, Asians, and all others!Except for his failure to discuss the lack of integrity among many of our elected officials, Hanson has done an admirable job. Mexifornia should be on the &quot;must read&quot; list of all who are concerned about the future of Californians, nothwithstanding the color of their skins!",

Hanson argues that the reason for this crisis is that both ends of the political spectrum have vested interests in continuing the unabated entry of illegal Mexicans. Republicans wish to placate business interests with cheap labor and Democrats hope for a future electoral base. Hanson further explains that this wave is not like the earlier waves of Polish, Jewish, or Italian immigration which was of a fixed duration and where the connection of the new immigrant to the Homeland was more thoroughly severed.This book is well written and to the point (approx. 140 pages). I have also seen Victor Hanson on several political talk shows. He is well spoken and mild mannered which is a welcome relief from the cacophonous diatribe we too often get on cable news channels.",

These professors will have apoplexy over this book.Few people in this country are aware of the strong feelings that Hispanic professors and legal and illegal aliens have about turning this part of our country into a kind of branch of Mexico.Dr. Hanson makes the point that immigrants forget why they left Mexico in the first place. They romanticize their memories of home and try to change the very culture here that they sought (American freedom and opportunity) into another Third World country. He tells how one immigrant friend told him, &quot;When we turn California into Mexico, we will move up to Oregon. When we turn Oregon into Mexico, we will move up to Washington...&quot;Dr. Hanson's conclusions in the Epilogue are stunning and are worth twice the price of the book. Every American who understands and cherishes our unique American culture should read this book.Dr. Hanson's tastiest quote from the book: &quot;I have a fantasy that somewhere in some secretive laboratory in Montana a white supremacist and a crackpot racist got together, brewed the germs of our present school curriculum, concocted the virus of La Raza separatist and racist mythology, and then released these pathogens by night in aerosol form to be inhaled by unsuspecting Californians, who then proceeded unknowingly to destroy the aspirations of millions of desperately poor aliens.&quot;",

No more watching what we say for fear of being labeled a racist when a black comedian like Eddie Griffin gets to rag on about how much he hates whites and gets audiences to laugh. It's time to speak up about illegal immigration in this country.For starters, I don't live in California. I don't live in the Southwest. And I don't live in Texas. I live in New England, and our community is under a serious immigration attack. Where there Indians that inhabited my little fishing town long before the settlers? Yes, there was a tribe, but they where wiped out by a French expeditionary force long before my ancestors settled, so their blood is not on my hands. If you wish to defend illegal immigration by bringing up the fact that Latinos are partially descended from native Meso American peoples so somehow they deserve the land more, well, remember they are only PARTIALLY descended from the natives. Remember, just as the US launched a genocidal campaign against indian peoples here, the Mestizo Mexicans routinely clashed with Indians and often drove them off their lands in Mexico. Most existing Aztecs today are offended when Mestizos claim Aztec blood, and a war against the indigenous peoples of Chiapas still rages on today.Back to where I come from, this is a place with a long history. I have family roots here dating back over 200 years ago. I have lived here my entire life. And yet when me and my girlfriend walk in some parts of town we get dirty looks from people who have only been living in this country -illegally- for a year or so. My kid brother is routinely teased and beaten up by his Mexican and Puerto Rican classmates, called \"little whitey boy\" and made fun of for not speaking spanish. In fact, fluency in English is very rare for their community. They figure they made it this far then why learn the savage white barbarian tongue? I'm not particularly fond of German, but if I ended up moving to Berlin for work, you'd better believe I'd be sprecken ze dutch!My family has had a proud history here and we worked hard for it. Everything was DIY, we didn't exploit any poor miserable peasant half a world away at any time, so I refuse to feel guilty and just let my community be overrun with third world thugs just because I happen to be a white american. Yes, immigration is a huge part of America, but you know what? Legal immigration is also a big part of America. Such a regular influx of illegals from Mexico severly damages the chances for LEGAL immigrants to seek their lives here.I won't respect their culture and ways if they don't respect ours. I don't want to pay anymore taxes to the constantly multiplying babies of a culture of people that hate me. I'm tired of being told to shut up and feel guilty and spoiled for being white and having legal citizenship. This book understands our nation's plight and is not afraid to speak out about it.",

He fearlessly dissects the current problems with U.S. Mexican immigration policy, skewering both the political right and left. Of course, the knee-jerk, and often vested, reactionaries will shout \"racist\" or \"bigot,\" which all-too-often prevents constructive, open dialogue from taking place, something sorely needed to improve the many obvious problems of widespread illegal immigration. This book is a good starting place for that dialogue.Hanson's underlying assertion that the Mexican government is worse than the U.S government, are indeed addressed. All but the most obtuse reader understands some of the obvious implications of one society always fleeing to the other, but never the reverse, to say nothing regarding infant mortality, life expectancy, available health care, literacy rates, purchasing power, economic mobility, etc.I did not give it five stars simply because I was hoping for a longer, deeper inquiry into the issue, closer to what Hanson has given us in his previous historical work. This can be forgiven, however, because Hanson is not attempting that sort of book. Besides, for all their various degrees, surveys, and studies, our social-\"scientists\" certainly have not provided any realistic solutions for our current immigration dilemma.",

While the Bush administration would like you to think that safety is its top priority, the truth is altogether different. Malkin points out the dozens of ways our enemies can and do get into the country without any difficulty. The borders are wide open if you want to come illegally. And if you want to come legally, 57 different varieties of visas await you.Who favors illegal immigration? Just about everyone except the man in the street. Politicians, the media, universities, businesses, the churches and the special interest groups all lobby on behalf of more immigration, both legal and illegal.As for the average citizen, 75% of whom want immediate and tangible reforms, we're stuck with what we have.Malkin's great book is written from the perspective of a concerned American. A first generation American, Malkin is correctly disbelieving of the system that is in place.Among the most moving passages deal with those slaughtered by the &quot;Railway Killer&quot; an illegal immigrant who crossed over and back dozens of times and was in and out of custody before apprehended. You will be deeply saddened when you read about the lives of these everyday Americans who were killed by someone who never should have been in the country.Don't miss this book. Although it is packed with facts, you will find that it is a page-turner. You just can't believe what has happened to America.A handy guide of websites where citizens can become active is offered at the end of the book.",

The reader will see how the government has abandoned the responsibility of protecting American citizens, and done so in the name of political correctness. This book is a wake up for all Americans.Malkin's work illustrates, not only the ease in which illegals breech our borders, but even the minute inconvenience it is for them to stay here, even after being arrested. The total ineptitude of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is deplorable, but Malkin shows the problem is hardly limited to the INS, but reaches into all associated with securing our borders.Fighting terrorism is undoubtedly the cause to be rallied around by all Americans in this decade, and it must start with stopping the influx of illegal aliens into America. This book will arm you with the knowledge needed to make educated commentary to your representatives, or even to debate this perilous issue on the local level.See how liberal ideals and regulations have opened our borders to this invasion of illegals. Look at actual case histories of illegal felons and how easily they were able to perpetuate their crimes and how they could have been stopped and American lives saved. Find out about the rampant corruption within our government agencies and courts that have a chokehold on American security.I recommend a lot of books, but this is one of the few I would place on the \"must read\" list. Michelle Malkin is one of today's finest writers and is on the short list of leadership spearheading the move for immigration reform.

One sneeringly commented that her ancestors probably exploited some loophole to get here illegally, and thus implies that she is some kind of traitor to her ethnic group by wanting to close the loopholes for others. Well, I daresay Ms. Malkin's ancestors probably arrived here legally, just as mine did when they got off the boat from Ireland. Like the author, I have no desire to see America closed to legal immigrants; they have always been a source of the human capital that has made our country as great as it is. And also like the author, I want very much to see illegal immigration curtailed, for it is a dangerous cover to the terrorists with whom we are at war, a breeding ground for crime and exploitation of the illegals themselves, and is a drain on the citizens of this country.",

She cites how immigration officials smuggled drugs, and people, peddled fake documents, traded visas for money and sex, and even punished and intimidated whistleblowers within the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Malkin also provides us with well thought out, logical solutions to our immigration problems.

It details exactly how our country is being hurt by illegal immigrants that are flowing into this country because our politicians (Republican AND Democrat) do not have the backbone to do what is right for this country. They are putting the ethnic vote over and above the safety of all Americans. People are being hurt and killed, mothers are being gang raped in New York, terrorists are flying planes into buildings, snipers are killing children and cops are being killed by these illegal immigrants and it must be stopped! Kudos to Michelle Malkin and all those brave enough to stick their head out and criticize the horrible US immigration policy that is doing absolutely NOTHING to keep out the illegal immigrants that our coming over and committing feolnies IN DROVES!For the people who rated this book negatively, are you using your brain at all or are you all sharing the same one?? What does Howard Zinn have to do with the law? So what if there was no border 500 years ago. Guess what? THERE IS ONE NOW! 100 years ago a different family owned the house that I own now. Does that mean that their descendants can barge in my house and rape my wife? According to your logic, it does. If I speak out against it am I a racist against whatever race the descendants happen to be? According to liberal logic, I am. Oh, and I own a copy of \"A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present\" and I have read it. Don't even bother wasting your time. You'll thank me for it. Now the book serves its most useful purpose: propping up one leg of my couch.Listen up. The fact that you want the law to be followed doesn't mean that you want to rule the world and the fact that you want our borders to be protected (as mandated by the United States Constitution) doesn't make you a racist. Malkin wants the law followed and she wants our borders closed up to illegal immigrants. She obviously has no problem with LEGAL immigration. The fact that her parents were LEGAL immigrants shows absolutely no hypocrisy at all. If I legally own a gun am I a hypocrite if I don't want guns sold on the black market? According to liberal logic, I am.Get a clue, Liberals. Malkin speaks the truth and you'd be wise to read her book. But take your lefty blinders off first.",

        "description": "On a hot summer night in 1930, three black teenagers accused of murdering a young white man and raping his girlfriend waited for justice in an Indiana jail. A mob dragged them from the jail and lynched two of them. No one in Marion, Indiana was ever punished for the murders. In this gripping account, James H. Madison refutes the popular perception that lynching was confined to the South, and clarifies 20th century America's painful encounters with race, justice, and memory.",

                "review/text": "In August of 1930, a lynching took place. It would not be uncommon for one to assume that the lynching took place in the deep south, but in this instance, the assumption would be incorrect. The lynchings of Tom Shipp and Abe Smith took place in Marion, Indiana, America's Heartland. This event is responsible for one of the most famous photographs of an American lynching.The author demonstrates how stereotypes and fear contributed to the lynching. The mere suggestion that a White woman was raped and a White man was murdered by three Black men, provided enough inspiration to turn a normally cordial, if not friendly, small town into a lynch mob. Madison outlines how a community dealt with the chilling reality that such mob violence had taken place in their small town. Because of shame, guilt and even fear, this tragic event was buried in Marion, Indiana's collective memory.Flossie Bailey, a prominent African American woman in the community, as well as others, worked hard to mobilize the community in an attempt to make sure that at least some of the people involved in the murders would be held responsible for the crimes while fear kept other African Americans in the community quiet. Unfortunately, no one was held responsible for the crime.Madison also highlights the history behind what is considered by many to be the most famous lynching photograph in American history. The photograph, taken by Lawrence Beitler the night of the lynching, has been reproduced and widely circulated. During the time immediately following the lynching, some people bought copies to serve as a \"trophy\", while others felt it was an abomination. It is a stirring photograph that depicts two dead men hanging from a tree while crowds of White's stand around some in their Sunday best, some pointing, and some chatting and laughing.This book begins with a vivid and chilling description of the events leading up to the lynching, the lynching itself and the events that followed. The description of the scene was a result of the author's extensive research which included interviews, reviewing court documents, magazines, books and other historical archives. Although the author noted that his initial goal was to write an article about the event, he quickly learned that the story of this lynching was much bigger than what could be captured in an article. In addition to the actual description of the events surrounding the lynching, the author creates a historical context by providing a description of life for both African Americans and Whites during the era. He details the role that the NAACP and committed community leaders played in fighting for broader civil rights for African Americans.He ends the book with a story of healing. On the night of the lynching, three men were in jail awaiting trial, yet only two of them were lynched. The third man, James Cameron's life was spared, and eventually Cameron began to share his story with the world. His goal in sharing the story was to promote racial healing and unity. This book touches on an area of American history that is often buried and rarely talked about. Through the author's research he is able to share a story that demonstrates just how far we as a Nation have come, and I highly recommend this book.Reviewed by Stacey Seay",

I grew up in Indiana and though I was a couple generations removed from this 1930 event, my parents were not. My childhood experiences and those noted by Dr. Madison were indeed similar. &quot;Knowing their place&quot; was a phrase I heard repeatedly growing up in the midwest though I never quite understood it. This book finally explained the very complex &quot;color lines&quot; present both then and now in Hoosierland.Aside from being right on when describing the mood and atmosphere of rural Indiana and small town America, I found Dr. Madison's description of the characters involved in this American tragedy poignant. I especially enjoyed reading about Flossie Baily, James Cameron and Oatess Archey. These are individuals whose efforts made a difference in their community and beyond.While some may feel that issues of race are not front page news since 9/11, racial profiling and curtailment of rights and freedoms in the name of security and justice are. As always the way to understand the present is by studying the past and what better way to see the error of our ways than by listening to the voices of the black and white residents of Marion, Indiana?This true story reads like fiction and the characters could easily carry this story to the big screen. It is an excellent book and should not be missed.",

I live near this town and never ever heard of anything ever happening like this. History we are ashamed of apparently gets swept under the rug. This book opened my eyes to race-relations in Indiana and in the northern states during the early 20th's century. It really sets the stage for the Civil Rights acts that follow - and it's is wonderful to understand it from such a local perspective.This book is not about &quot;lynching&quot;. It is about injustice and mob-mentalities, as well as the history of race-relations in the U.S. - from the perspective of a small midwestern town. A town that many people would consider to be a typical place. The history written is non-fiction, although I wish in many ways it were fiction. I find it difficult to grasp that humans act the ways they do, and the author did a fabulous job of remaining objective and explaining the facts in a sleuth-like manner.",

                "review/text": "James H. Madison has provided us with a book about an incident that no one wants to know about - a bit of ugly history that we would rather not think, much less READ, about. A LYNCHING IN THE HEARTLAND: Race and Memory in America is a brilliant investigation and commentary on the heinous incident on August 7, 1930 in Marion, Indiana. On that quiet night in the quiet heartland of America, far removed from the South with its long-standing history of racial clashes, two African American men were snatched from the jail by white mob frenzy and hung from a tree for the 'dastardly deed' of murder and rape of a white couple. No trial, no conviction, just an acting out of racial hatred, an act captured in the most famous photograph of a lynching in the American context. Madison reports the events factually with a mesmerizingly accurate attention to detail. But the story does not stop there. Madison has researched the history prior to the incident and the subsequent followup that identified brilliant African American leaders and challengers, one of whom was the third man not lynched on that hideous evening in 1930 - James Cameron. Madison then reflects on the whole history of racism in this country, beginning with the equally offensive murders and tortures of the American Indians and extending down to extant incidences up to the time of the publication of this valuable, disturbing book.Madison repeatedly makes the point that if we don't study our history and vividly recall our past then we are doomed to persist in unjust racial crimes. This is a tough book to swallow, but a very important one for all of us to read. Only by exposing ourselves to the ugly events of our history can we hope to learn and prevent such madness from recurring. An eloquent, vital, and impressive contribution.",

I think that much of it can be summed up by gazing at the front cover for awhile - the cover photograph is a timeless statement on race-relations in Indiana in the early 20th century.This work reads like a gripping movie-script, a drama and detective story, where you find heroes abound by their courage to speak up against the actions of the mob who lynched 2 teen-agers on a summer night. But unfortunately this work is not fiction, it is true - from the accounts of what happened in the town the night the boys were suspected of killing a white teen and raping his girlfriend on lovers-lane, to the mob-mentality that eventually took the lives of these two boys. I live near the town where it happened, and I wish it weren't true.The author did a superb job getting this early 20th century American history to read like something from one's imagination - he is truly gifted as a historical writer - as the words jump off the page as you read, gripping you, entangling you in the tragedy, and making emotions (ones that you probably don't like to express) - flood through you.",

        "Title": "cornell 69 liberalism and the crisis of the american university",
        "description": "In April 1969, one of America's premier universities was celebrating parents' weekend-and the student union was an armed camp, occupied by over eighty defiant members of the campus's Afro-American Society. Marching out Sunday night, the protesters brandished rifles, their maxim: \"If we die, you are going to die.\" Cornell '69 is an electrifying account of that weekend which probes the origins of the drama and describes how it was played out not only at Cornell but on campuses across the nation during the heyday of American liberalism. Donald Alexander Downs tells the story of how Cornell University became the battleground for the clashing forces of racial justice, intellectual freedom, and the rule of law. Eyewitness accounts and retrospective interviews depict the explosive events of the day and bring the key participants into sharp focus: the Afro-American Society, outraged at a cross-burning incident on campus and demanding amnesty for its members implicated in other protests; University President James A. Perkins, long committed to addressing the legacies of racism, seeing his policies backfire and his career collapse; the faculty, indignant at the university's surrender, rejecting the administration's concessions, then reversing itself as the crisis wore on. The weekend's traumatic turn of events is shown by Downs to be a harbinger of the debates raging today over the meaning of the university in American society. He explores the fundamental questions it posed, questions Americans on and off campus are still struggling to answer: What is the relationship between racial justice and intellectual freedom? What are the limits in teaching identity politics? And what is the proper meaning of the university in a democratic polity?",

Downs' wonderful study of student power shows the inevitable problems that emerged when well-intentioned university liberals surrendered their fundamental academic principles in the name of compassion. Downs illustrates the unintended consequences of affirmative action, from students who did not want so much to learn from the institution...they wanted to radically change the institution.The students understood politics, public relations and the power of the &quot;big lie&quot;. While they may not have been competent to lead Cornell through needed change, Downs makes it clear that neither was the Cornell administration ready or able to manage change.Once the violent takeover began, what little control President Perkins had was lost. The subsequent finger-pointing and resignations were unavoidable. Yet questions remain: Was it institutional racism fostered by a priest or political correctness that set off the furor? Who burned the cross in front of the African-American residence hall? Did the administration have a hand in the fraternity &quot;counterattack&quot; on Straight? Was this a spontaneous act out of frustration by African-American students or an SDS plot to radically reform Cornell? After it was over, did Cornell learn any lessons?I could not put it down. A must read for baby boomers, especially those intent on understanding events that formed the ideology of those in the White House today.",

The world witnessed the decline of docile, gentle student behavior, managed by old white men in tweed coats. Students found new, forceful ways to express themselves, and opened an era of campus struggles.Downs demonstrates that students know enough to know they don't want to learn some of the things that there teachers are teaching, yet they are also young and naive enough to stumble about agressively and sometimes irrationally for a solution. And the senior professors, save a few stalwarts, had no capacity to deal with this new breed of students.Based on Cornell's desire to &quot;do good&quot;, to promote social justice, to provide meaningful educational opportunities, and to add diversity (before there was such a common, abused term on American campuses), the Trustees approved a plan to enroll disenfranchised students from urban areas at their bucolic campus. Cornell was Ivy League, yes, but more rural than sophisticated, more agricultural than urbane. Cornell was to provide a strange environment for a noble experiment. Did it work? After the takeover of the administration building by armed students, most Americans never looked at university education the same way again.Meticulous archival research of previously unsurfaced or unpublished records brings life and details to a college's uncomfortable history.",

How, asks Terry Eastland, did such a turnabout take place, and how can we restore colorblind law in America today? In this compelling and powerful book, Eastland lays bare the absurdities and injustices of affirmative action, and presents the strongest case to date for doing away with race-based and gender-based preferences-a ringing call for all Americans to reclaim our nation's shared values of equal protection under the law, without reference to race, color, creed, gender, or national origin.",

Minority groups behaved as anyone receiving a state-sponsored benefit does - they adopted the \"philosophy\" and began to protect their newly discovered \"rights\". The fact that these \"rights\" had no legal basis and questionable pedigree in the cast and race-obsessed systems of India, Malaysia and Yugoslavia seemed of little consequence at the time. The term \"Balkanisation\" (a sad relic of Old World ethnic hatred) now has a disturbing echo in the affirmative action policies of the New World.Other reviewers may argue that affirmative action policies cannot be \"unjust\" because, although discriminatory, they are not designed to humiliate or alienate whites - only to benefit that amorphous group called \"underrepresented minorities\".

Readers who are fed up with all the impassioned tirades against and all the fanatical polemics in favor of giving certain people Most Favored Race status will find this book a welcome relief.Chapter 1 (pp. 1 - 20) makes the point that prejudice by any other name is still prejudice. It doesn't cease to be prejudice depending on which race it is directed against.Chapter 2 (pp. 21 - 38) sketches the history of the America's insistence on no discrimination based on \"race, color, creed or country of national origin.\"Chapter 3 describes the about-face the nation did in the 1960s. \"It is hard to find in the speeches or statements of civil rights leaders prior to the early 1960s any sustained interest in `preferential treatment' for blacks.\" (p. 42). In 1961, CORE, then a small splinter party, began to agitate for racial preferences. One thing that helped cause the about-face was rioting. \"The traditional response to a riot had been to hold the rioting individuals responsible.\" (p. 44). A commission appointed by President Johnson in 1968 held that \"white racism\" was responsible. (p. 45). This began the now-accepted practice of holding the victims responsible for the crimes of racially ennobled individuals.Once the crack had been opened to preferences based on factors other than skills and performance, the dam burst and many other groups were granted Most Favored Group status until by 1990 the only group not eligible for preferential treatment was white American heterosexual males.As legal challenges were mounted and public opposition swelled, the wording of laws became more cagey: race, ethnicity and country of national origin were to be \"one factor among many\" in determining who was preferred. This protected the preferred groups from legal challenges and allowed them to go on doing preference-as-usual in college admissions, hiring and contracting.What most Americans do not realize is that this rather bizarre program and its rationale was only one among several that has placed this nation in great peril.

In a political system where two parties reign supreme, 40% of Americans consider themselves neither Democrats nor Republicans, but independents. Independents elected President Barack Obama in 2008 and then, in a seeming reversal, gave control of Congress to the Republicans in 2010. But who are these independents? Angry moderates? Frustrated ideologues? The base for the third party? Reformers or revolutionaries? Jacqueline Salit has spent 30 years as an insider in this growing movement of outsiders. She recounts the little-known history of this volatile force as old political institutions and categories are becoming irrelevant - even repugnant - to many Americans. An architect of unorthodox left/right coalitions within the Perot movement and Reform Party, and manager of Michael Bloomberg's three New York mayoral campaigns on the Independence Party line, Salit explores how these unclaimed voters are not only deciding elections, but reshaping the political landscape. With a surprising cast of characters - from the famous to the unknown - Salit argues that the failure to heed this movement against partisanship (and even parties) puts political careers at risk and damages essential features of American democracy. She reveals how independents underestimate their own power and how they can make the most of their newfound moment in the sun.",

                "review/text": "Anyone whose intuition is telling them that &quot;things aren't quite right&quot; in the governence of our democracy, I totally recommend this read. The Democrats like to project their party as the Party of the People, but my own experience is that doesn't jive anymore, but I couldn't put it into words. Nader's book was quite helpful in beginning to see that the Democrats & Republicans are more concerned with winning and maintaining power than addressing the pressing needs of the country. I found myself sad at certain passages, realizing that we Americans are losing our capacity for self-governence, and the political class is quite willing to hurt average folks if it means re-election for them and $$ for their corporate friends. Nader's book, as well as his campaign, is shedding light on some ugly facts about our two-party system. After reading the book, I find current news events more alarming, especially how the Democrats are subverting democracy by keeping him off the ballot and away from the voters. Republicans, in a public display of inconfidence in Pres Bush, are also guilty of gaming the ballot access laws. Both parties refuse to acknowledge that their are 10s of millions of Independents and non-voters who no longer support them or their practices. The most alarming realization is this: The Democrats & Republicans are failing the American people in huge ways and causing a lot of human pain, and yet they will not yield to any grassroots solutions. Nader is quite eloquent on this point: any solution to the Nation's problems outside of the two-party framework will *not* be considered. It dawned on me how limited our options have become if we continue to invest all our energy in participating in this endless two-party fight. Nader is doing what he's always done best -- expose the oppressors of average people by fighting the good fight. For all the crap he's taking from the &quot;anybody but Bush crowd&quot;, he has the high road in this debate -- he's mostly right. After reading his book and his website, I admire his courage for sticking to his principles and truly defending democracy and, along with that, the interests of the American people.",

                "review/text": "Once again Ralph Nader steps up to the plate that few others will approach. In &quot;The Good Fight&quot; Nader again challenges the status quo, voter apathy, and citizens who have forgotten that THEY run the USA, not corporate interests. As with his previous books, Nader presents an unnerving mix of dispair and hope. He awakens the reader with the progressive view of the problems with America. Such claims of corporate corruption of politics, disregard for human rights, dwindling consumer rights, a failed health care system, and wanton destruction of the environment assail the reader and provoke a sense of hopelessness. But then just as quickly, Nader offers insight, strategy, encouragement, and hope to turn things around and put the PEOPLE back in DEMOCRACY.Neither a Republican nor a Democrat (difficult for some people to comprehend), Nader points out the shortcomings of both parties and how they have both surrendered to corporate interests. Corporations donate millions of dollars to candidates. Upon election the candidates subsequently act in the interest of their corporate donors, not in the interest of thier constituency. Corporations with no allegiance to the USA then expand their rights, while all-too-often weakening the rights of the people. With so many people obsessed with hot-button issues, they fail to see this undermining of democracy at a fundamental level.&quot;We are a nation of, by, and for the people, not corporations.&quot;Regardless of your partisanship, I recommend this book as a superb eye-opener. If it fails to provoke constructive thought, clear your mind of political bias and read it again. Since completing this book (as well as previous Nader books) I have passed it on to friends and family across the political spectrum. All have agreed that at the very least, it will make you think twice about what you think you know.",

We need to be involved, discuss citizenship with our children over the dinner table, and take active steps as patriots to ensure we have a democracy. We have been hijacked by our own corporate CEO's and politicians for over 40 years. We are powerless to the corporate greed that infiltrates every aspect of our lives, from our heath, our standard of living, even our sexuality. And we are all to blame for being way to complacent. Democracy is not a spectator sport. If you don't fight for it daily, you will not have it. The internet is a tool to bypass biased media and put power in the hands of the average person...if they choose to use it.Admittedly, I did not know much about Ralph Nader when I voted for Gore in 2000 and blamed him for Gore losing to some extent. I realize now, that is another corporate lie. In checking the FEC.GOV elections results for 2000 and comparing them with MSNBC exit polls, it turns out the Democrats caused Bush to win by voting for him...8 million of them. Clinton's own moving the party more toward corporate ownership and less for the people was part of this. When you talk to the average voter whether republican, democrat, or other, they all seem to agree on wanting more value focus in our America and less corruption. Ralph Nader has led a life against corruption. If ever there was an advocate for the people it is Mr. Nader.I don't know if the American public is smart enough to get involved and/or to vote for Nader. Maybe the decades of brainwashing from the media and corporate elite have turned us into the George Orwellian 1984. The two major parties have long since stopped serving the people. I believe if the republican and democrat VOTERS would seize the opportunity to take the steps Mr. Nader has outlined in his book, we could take back ownership of this country and put it in the citizens' hands once again. All the blaming of George Bush for the current state is just what is wrong with our mentalities. The problems with our political process and corporate ownership started long before him and under both republican and democrat administrations, and, will continue long after him regardless of who wins this election...unless people stand up and fight against it.Imagine if those 100 million people in America who do not vote would stand up and vote this year, and not for a republican or a democrat. Imagine the power! And imagine if each of the 200 million voters took it upon themselves to actively do something each week in their communities to fight against our decaying society.The American dream has been dead for the younger generations. I think Mr. Nader is challenging us to revive that dream once again. Democracy is not a spectator sport. Get involved!",

He fought with GE to make cars safer which saved numerous lives, he founded 100 civic organizations (to help out the American people), and he devoted/devotes his life to help Americans.Have you ever wondered or felt frustrated that no matter how much money you make, it is not enough or you just don't feel peace? Well this is a great book for you. This book will inspire you about how to make America an excellent place.Think of Erin Brokovich and how she helped out people who were being abused by PG&E;, Nader is the same type of person, except he has helped thousands or even millions of people.Does anybody feel like our senators, congressman, president, etc. are our employees? Probably not, you probably feel like you are their employees even though you pay their tax dollars and elect them to represent you to act in their interests. Wouldn't it be nice to elect people who actually care and listen to you - make you their number one priority? - I really get that kind of feeling from Mr. Nader.- Finally a quote from the book - you may think you won't make a difference but each of us is like a few drops of water and if all the water combines it makes a great river.",

His decades of service to an ungrateful nation translate into a book packed with a litany of wrongs transpiring day-in and day-out in America.The Good Fight, Nader points out, just happens to coincide with his candidacy for the US presidency.

In the last decade, impotent antimicrobial drugs have compromised the treatment of many deadly diseases in poor countries. More recently, negligent production at a Massachusetts compounding pharmacy sickened hundreds of Americans. While the national drugs regulatory authority (hereafter, the regulatory authority) is responsible for the safety of a country's drug supply, no single country can entirely guarantee this today. The once common use of the term counterfeit to describe any drug that is not what it claims to be is at the heart of the argument. In a narrow, legal sense a counterfeit drug is one that infringes on a registered trademark. The lay meaning is much broader, including any drug made with intentional deceit. Some generic drug companies and civil society groups object to calling bad medicines counterfeit, seeing it as the deliberate conflation of public health and intellectual property concerns. Countering the Problem of Falsified and Substandard Drugs accepts the narrow meaning of counterfeit, and, because the nuances of trademark infringement must be dealt with by courts, case by case, the report does not discuss the problem of counterfeit medicines.",

The Fluoride Deception reads like a thriller, but one supported by two hundred pages of source notes, years of investigative reporting, scores of scientist interviews, and archival research in places such as the newly opened files of the Manhattan Project and the Atomic Energy Commission. The book is nothing less than an exhumation of one of the great secret narratives of the industrial era: how a grim workplace poison and the most damaging environmental pollutant of the cold war was added to our drinking water and toothpaste.",

The Fluoride Deception documents a cover-up perpetrated by a military-industrial-government complex starting in the 1930's and extending to the present day. Any person involved in the issue of fluoridation will want this excellent compendium of the history and science. The author has uncovered previously secret documents which reveal that fluoridation promotion is in the same league with \"cigarette science\" when it comes to distortion of science and public opinion.After documenting all the scientific evidence for why fluoridation is a bad idea, a common response has been: \"If it's so obviously bad, why do my dentist, the Surgeon General, and my toothpaste company all say it is so wonderful?\" Bryson's book gives the answer. A powerful group of industries have worked behind the scenes to sell the idea of fluoridation. Their public relations campaign has been one of the most successful in history.I long took for granted that fluoride was the reason I had much better teeth than my parents. I grew up with Crest toothpaste commercials repeating their \"Look mom, no cavities!\" message into my young impressionable mind ad nauseum. But not too long ago I found that rates of cavities have dropped precipitously in all industrial countries of the world over the past 50 years and most of these countries do not fluoridate their water. Countries with detailed public health records reveal the decline started before fluoride was ever added to toothpaste or water.Bryson has uncovered secret government and industry documents showing that the aluminum, steel, atomic weapons, phosphate fertilizer, and other industries all have been aware for more than 50 years that one of the most serious and costly pollutants these industries release is airborne fluorides. The cold war obsession with building ever more nuclear weapons to win the \"arms race\" cemented cooperation between government and industry to promote fluoridation. The US Public Health Service during the 1940s was still a division of the Department of Commerce and its head was a top attorney for Alcoa. Bryson found meetings and letters between the military, Public Health Service, and industry where the idea of putting a shiny public relations image on fluoride by adding it to water first surfaced.With today's increasing revelations about drug industry manipulation of science and government campaigns of deception, maybe the time is ripe for Bryson's book. Some people won't be willing to believe that their own dentist may have been duped. They won't feel comfortable reading this book. But for everyone curious enough to glimpse into the dark side of science manipulated for profit, this book is for them.For environmentalists this book is as essential reading as Rachel Carson's Silent Spring.For dentists and public health officials ... gather up your courage and read this book.",

                "review/text": "This book refutes the mass of commercially motivated lies and propaganda about fluoride, giving us the facts and motivation we need to make the effort to keep this poisonous substance out of our lives. The challenge is that fluoride is nearly everywhere -- not only in most toothpastes and tap water but in processed, packaged, prepared and fast foods. Most of these are either manufactured using fluoridated tap water or include it as an ingredient. Surprisingly, this is also true of some \"health foods,\" with high levels of fluoride found in soy protein isolate, a key ingredient in energy bars, shake powders, veggie burgers and infant formula. Babies on soy formula are at special risk not only for developing dental fluorosis but the mental fluorosis of ADD/ADHD. Although the fluoride levels of both soy and dairy formulas exceed that of breast milk, only soy formulas exceed safe levels when reconstituted with non-fluoridated distilled water. The levels increase considerably when parents reconstitute soy formula with fluoridated tap water. Worse, these soy bottle-fed infants are simultaneously exposed to high levels of neurotoxic aluminum, cadmium, manganese and plant estrogens. It's bad enough to expose adults to fluoride with its well-established links to cancer, thyroid and other endocrine system disorders but unconscionable to expose infants and children whose brain, reproductive and other systems are developing. I urge readers to buy extra copies of this book, give them to public health officials, urge them to stop promoting fluoride as beneficial to our health, warn the public about its toxicity and to press for the legislation needed to remove this waste product from our water supply.",

Bryson?s book is a landmark in the field, and full of original material, much recently declassified. It will be prominently featured in my fluoride essay when I re-edit my site sometime in the next year (I hope!). Bryson?s book reveals matters far more horrific than I related I my original essay. There were numerous fluorine accidents during the Manhattan Project, with workers literally disintegrating at times. It was all covered up in the name of ?national security.? There were many places in the book where I had to step back and take in the institutional evil that Bryson was documenting. Plenty was hair-raising. For instance, during the Manhattan Project, the protection afforded workers was nil, and many worked in a constant mist of hydrogen fluoride (HF), one of the deadliest acids known. Where the workers were most exposed to the HF, white people were not allowed as their skin damage was too obvious. So, in the most dangerous HF environments, the only workers allowed were black.The U.S. government took the line of fluoride polluters, spinning an extremely hazardous waste into a health product. Much of the spinning happened just as Orwell?s 1984 was being published. I am not sure what the scariest part of the book is. Is it that the U.S. government performed extensive research into fluorine?s effect in the central nervous system (and all the results are still classified)? Or perhaps that the same people performing those experiments (who also performed the notorious plutonium experiments on unwitting subjects), were the same ?scientists? who produced the ?information? that showed how harmless fluoride was for people, as well as good for our teeth?! Bryson uncovered one study that showed the deleterious effects of fluoride on animal subjects, research that was paid for by fluoride polluters in the 1960s as they tried defending themselves from pollutions lawsuits. The results were so damning they were buried for 40 years until Bryson discovered it (the study showed fluoride causing emphysema when inhaled). All in all, Bryson?s book is an amazing effort.",

And I would encourage anyone reading my review first, to peruse the others as well, as they fill in the gaps with other topics I may have missed for lack of space. Together, they all paint a big picture of why this book is so important.Bryson does not merely make a convincing argument for the dangers of fluoride. Yes, he does that, too. More importantly, though, he blows the doors wide open on the deliberate deception by industry and government to hide these dangers and to, in fact, sell its necessity to the public in direct contradiction to these dangers. Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, he was able to procure a wealth of first-hand documents from the very people in industry and government who made this deception happen. Memos, letters, directives - he saw them all, and his exhaustive documentation of them illuminate the depth of the deception. It was this very fact that impressed me most about the book. As a historian, I was pleasantly surprised by how much first-hand documents he cited. Here were the very words of the people leading the industrial and govermental move to suppress the dangers and, indeed, sell fluoride as something good for us all! (Let us see your beautiful smiles!)The deception was big. Fluoride played a huge role in the development of atomic weapons, but it was a massive environmental and health pollutant. \"National security\" reasons dictated a need to hide these dangers, so a massive PR movement began to find publicly-accepted outlets for it: Enter toothpaste and the water supply. Smile, indeed! You're ingesting nuclear waste.Perhaps the most important part of the book is the chapter about propaganda and the molding of public opinion. It offers so much insight into how the American public are so often duped by the military-industrial state. The author interviews Edward Bernays, the \"Father of Public Relations\" (who was 102 years old at the interview). He was one of the government's top propagandists, even as far back as WWI. Bernays tells Bryson that selling the American public on fluoride was easy because of Americans' inherent trust in \"medical authority\". People simply want to believe their doctors know everything. Once industry found a few doctors and dentists to play the game by pushing the fluoride-is-good-for-you idea (and at the same time, suppressing any negative publicity), the power of collective thinking ensured the deception's effectiveness.And as one other reviewer wrote . . . makes one wonder what else they may be lying about.",

                "review/text": "Christopher Bryson definitely did thorough research before writing this book. It is a startling look at the awful truth about the deadly poison fluoride. Before WWII it was used only as rat and ant-roach poison. The only reason fluoride ever got used for anything else was the need for a gas so reactive it would split uranium atoms in half. We were in a race with the Germans to develop the Hydrogen Bomb. Neither the US or Germany were having success in working with fluoride. It would blow up whatever it was housed in and set the building on fire. Finally, they were able to prevent this from happening and Hiroshima and Nagasaki are history. The real star of this event according to Bryson is not uranium, but rather fluoride.Once WWII was over we had the cold with the Soviets to contend with. We needed to keep ahead of them in the nuclear arms race. To most Americans fluoride was still considered rat posion. Something had to be done to make it acceptable to the American people. Some flawed research in the 1950s showed that it prevented tooth decay. The rest is history.Many court battles have been fought over the toxicity of fluoride to the soil. One famous case was fought by the New Jersey peach growers with Dupont. They were downwind from the Dupont plant. In the summer of 1943 their orchards were blighted, their poultry were dying, and their fields were often strewed with dead cattle. Some cows were so crippled they could not stand up. The horses were to stiff to work. Workers who ate the produce they had picked vomited all night and into the next day. The Farm workers sued DuPont and the Manhattan Project (atomic weapons research) for fluoride damages. Workers inside the plant were often exposed to large doses of fluoride. They often developed a fibroid condition of both lungs and chemical burns were seen.All these human, plant and animal damages are classic signs of fluoride poisoning. Wherever a chemical, aluminum, steel or fertilizer manufacturing plant using fluoride was located the surrounding vegetation would turn brown and the domestic and wild animals would look sickly, cripple up and die. The people in and outside the factories would exhibit all the classic symptoms of fluorosis (fluoride poisoning). The military didn't want fluoride to be declared toxic and neither did the big manufacturers.It doesn't target one part of the body, fluoride is a systemic (total body) poison. The signs of fluorosis are identical to the sign of thyroid malfunctioning. Fluoride and iodine are antagonists, so it can seem like a person is low in iodine, when actually the fluoride is preventing the iodine from being used by the thyroid. Fluoride also prevents minerals, such as calcium and magnesium from being used by the body.

                "review/text": "\"The Fluoride Deception\" is a scathing indictment of how the U.S. medical community, big corporations, and the federal government, misled the American public for decades about the dangers of fluoride. Filled with scientific studies and historical documents, all fully annotated, Bryson mounts a point by point attack on the flimsy, fallacious arguments of pro-fluoride advocates. He shows us the secret history of fluoride, how it was connected to the development of the atomic bomb, and the self-serving and sly actions of those corporations, mainly metal manufacturers, in deceiving the public into believing that fluoride was safe to add to our water supplies. Using public opinion techniques developed by spin doctors like Edward Bernays, these companies used every technique known in modern propaganda science to convince Americans and the world that fluoride was just another natural and harmless chemical, when the opposite was true and they knew it.In a race to develop atom bombs to counteract a perceived threat from its former ally, the Soviet Union, the United States broadened its nuclear development program through an unprecedented collusion between government and industry. In his farewell address to the nation in 1961, president Eisenhower warned that \"we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the Military-Industrial Complex.\"This complicity is seen clearly in the history of fluoride and the public relations exercise carried out by government and industry that fooled America into thinking this deadly chemical was good for a our teeth. As it turns out, fluoride, and its industrial counterpart fluorine gas, described by some as a \"violent monster,\" is one of the most toxic chemicals on the planet inducing skeletal fluorosis, arthritis, thyroid problems, bone cancer, and hyperactivity in animals.As Bryson explains, fluoride is a necessary ingredient in nuclear bomb production, as essential as uranium. In the 1940's, the U.S. government and corporate America were faced with a flurry of worker and citizen lawsuits about fluoride poisoning. Industry-sponsored research and clever spin control transformed the nation's perception of fluoride from a toxic chemical pollutant into a medical supplement dispensed in water.Bryson documents how various industries funded studies that showed the dangers of fluoride to workers in metal fabricating plants, and nuclear bomb production-factories. The most damaging studies were kept hidden from public sight until recently.Fluoride, ubiquitous in so many household products, turns out to be one of the most deadly known chemicals and has no safe place in our food supply. That the U.S. medical establishment supports adding it to our water only attests to the gigantic and criminal fraud that has been perpetrated upon the U.S. and a few other countries that advocate fluoridation. Bryson's book is one of the best I have ever read on any subject. Read it if you want to know the disturbing truth about the secret agendas of those who make public policy in America.(Dr. Simeon Hein is the author of \"Opening Minds: A Journey of Extraorindary Encounters, Crop Circles, and Resonance\" and the forthcoming \"Planetary Intelligence.\")",

                "review/text": "This book contains an amazing amount of new material about the origin of water fluoridation and it answers many questions about the motives behind it. Why were many important physicians, dentists and scientists who opposed fluoridation systematically stigmatized and falsely discredited during its early promotion? Why have thousands of scientific studies revealing the harmfulness of low levels of fluoride ingestion never been revealed in the major media? The answer, as usual, lies in following the money trail. Christopher Bryson brilliantly documents and puts together the pieces of this dramatic mystery after many years of researching hidden and classified information behind the story. All who are now forced to drink fluoridated water should read this important book and learn how fluoridation began in the backrooms of those industries long guilty of major environmental pollution with toxic fluoride emissions. Promoters (including the US Public Health Service) have painted themselves into a corner, so ending fluoridation would be hugely embarrassing to them. Shining this new light on the sordid history of fluoridation will hopefully do much to stimulate objective and overdue scientific scrutiny of the procedure and the harm it has long inflicted on the US public.",

                "review/text": "\"If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away.\" Those words, or something similar, are on every tube of fluoride toothpaste sold in America. What could be in it to cause such a warning? According to this book, it's the fluoride.Fluoride is not some safe, innocuous substance that happens to fight cavities. It is used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons, to prepare Sarin nerve gas, to produce high octane gasoline, also to make refrigerant gases and Teflon plastic. It is also used in drugs like Prozac and Cipro. Fluoride is a potential workplace poison and grave environmental hazard.Since the 1930s, fluoride has been linked, in Europe, to a number of illnesses, like central nervous system disorders, breathing problems and a number of arthritis-like ailments. But during the Cold War, with help from researchers funded by the government and industry, no such problems were reported in America. It is as if \"American\" fluoride and \"European\" fluoride have two different sets of properties. Can anyone say \"scientific fraud?\"Fluoride may actually help the teeth, but the evidence is not clear-cut. Cavity rates have fallen dramatically since the 1940s, but also in countries that don't fluoridate their water. Perhaps good nutrition, better dental care and antibiotics can explain it.The vast majority, nearly 90 percent, of the fluoride added to drinking water is actually industrial waste, scraped from the smokestacks of Florida phosphate fertilizer mills. The companies are spared the expense of treating this \"fluosilicic acid\" as toxic waste. Instead, it is sold to towns all over America. Shipped in rubber-lined tanker trucks, it is dumped into municipal reserviors, supposedly to fight cavities.On several levels, this book easily reaches the level of Wow. This well-written tale of public relations whitewash and corporate/government collusion at the people's expense has over 100 pages of footnotes, and is very much a Must Read.",

                "review/text": "The Fluoride Deception, by former BBC journalist Christopher Bryson, is an extremely well-researched book (10 years in the making with over 100 pages of footnotes), and it contains a history of fluoride almost completely unknown to most people.From out of the memory hole, Bryson has brought forth declassified government docs and internal industry memos that help deconstruct (and obliterate) the corporate spin (e.g. 'look ma, no cavities') that has been internalized for too long by too many people - even by people who are otherwise aware and progressive.Some examples of the material Bryson has unearthed:* Fluoride was industry's biggest air pollutant during the Cold War, causing the greatest amount (by far) of litigation, both for damage to workers and damage to the environment* The biggest air pollution disaster in US history was a result of fluoride air emissions, not sulfur gases as the government has long contended (Bryson provides new compelling evidence on this - see the ALCOA memo)* The main scientists promoting the safety of fluoride had profound (yet often unknown) conflicts of interest* Fluoride was a vitally important chemical to national security, as it was the chemical used (on a massive scale) by the US bomb program to process and refine the uranium* Scientists in the US bomb program (e.g. Harold C. Hodge) who were involved with the human radiation experiments, were behind the implementation of the early water fluoridation trials* The &quot;Father of Public Relations&quot; Edward Bernays was involved in the early campaign to fluoridate the nation's water* Studies (Bryson provides several irrefutable examples) indicating seriously harmful effects of fluoride exposure were suppressed and never published.In a nutshell, The Fluoride Deception is a seminally important book about a surprisingly important subject: the risks of fluoride to our health and environment. It is a must read for anyone interested in the fluoride issue and/or the making of the Atomic Bomb.",

                "review/text": "For years I've known that fluoride was most dangerous to our health. Knowing Hitler put it in the water to mollify the German public was enough to make me skeptical of ever using it. Bryson has done an exemplary job of digging up the entire background and facts on this water additive. I purchased several of these books and gave one to my veternarian as they used to give animals fluoride treatments after cleaning their teeth. When I mentioned that fluoride was poison and not at all good for the animals, my vet said that he'd seen cattle with horrid fluorosis around Alcoa, TN where the aluminum is made. It's in the water in horrendous amounts there. We won't even buy toothpaste with fluoride in it (you can buy TOM'S) and we have a special filter on our drinking water that removes both fluoride and chlorine. Of course showering in fluoride treated water is not good for you either as you breath in the steam.So many cities fought putting fluoride in the water, and rightfully so. The belief that it was good for teeth and bones has not been proven out and was a false deduction from the get go. But boy what a great way for the corporations and government to get rid of their fluoride poison. Feed it to the masses.There's massive amounts of deception that are just like this. Might want to order and read MARY, FERRIE, AND THE MONKEY VIRUS, another mass poisoning of the public in the 50's and 60's with the polio sugar cube vaccine contaminated with SV-40 monkey virus which causes soft cell tissue cancers. Also might want to order FAST FOOD NATION about the meat slaughtering business and fast food. It will make you stay away from all of them.Kudos to Bryson...I hope he does more. Excellent expose!",
