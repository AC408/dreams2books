                "review/text": "Failure among the ambitious, upwardly mobile, educated and intelligent of our modern, industrialized society often comes across as being more devastating, more defining, and more frightening than it actually is. What in actuality defines us is not the number of our failures, but how we deal with our failure, how we look upon it, and most importantly, how we either use our failure or allow our failures to define us.Hyatt and Gottlieb have written an excellent text on professional/career failure. The authors start the book by imparting intrepid examples both personal and private, of the emotional processes associated with failure. They accurately describe (often in painful and excruciating detail) the feelings of fear, isolation, shame and remorse associated with losing a job, status, money or some combination of the three. One can not only relate to the loss of purpose, the punctured egos, and the declining sense of self of those who have failed professionally, but also can actually feel as if it is happening to him or her- for it at some point has happened to him or her. They emphatically stress that career failure is something that eventually touches every professional, in some cases sooner, and in others, later. In this way, they show that failure has no prejudices, and everyone is a card-carrying member of this club, whether they realize it or not. As such, in dealing with failure, it is extremely important for the individual to realize that he or she is not alone in the experience, even if our greater society compels us to put up a strong front and pretend that nothing is really wrong. In order to healthily deal with failure, the authors emphasize the importance of understanding the meaning of failure in both the personal and the societal context, and elaborate upon how the feelings associated with failure unfold in the individual. Many people define themselves based on their occupation, their professional affiliation, or their status in life, and it comes as no surprise that these are the people hardest hit by career failure. Those of us who have cultivated other sides of our personality, such as those of us who live for our weekend hobbies, or those of us that are family or community oriented, tend to handle career failure much better, and can even take it in stride. Although many readers and those who have experienced failure or are currently experiencing failure may not believe it, failure actually gives people options, which the authors not only demonstrate, but also help the reader identify and ultimately take advantage of in later chapters.In the first part of the book, one chapter each is devoted to defining the characteristics of failure at the level of the individual and the society, dealing with the feelings, which occur in stages, associated with failure, how our career failures can affect those closest to us, and how men and women respond to career failure. The second part of the book focuses on taking failure in stride, and offers a comprehensive strategy for personal reinvention after suffering a career failure. Arguably the most important part of the book, this section devotes one comprehensive chapter to each of the following topics: discovering why one has failed, gleaning from the failure some positive knowledge by re-interpreting the events leading up to the failure, recognizing and casting off old and inappropriate labels and finding new ones, expanding one's career choices, and making the transition from the old professional to the new, centered and focused individual. The authors also include in this section of the book a bonus chapter that showcases two successfully reinvented individuals, and elaborates upon the nature of their failure, how they dealt with failure, and the process of their reinvention. Each chapter in the second part of the book provides the reader with powerful tactics to build a new, improved person from career failure, and allows one to rise triumphantly out of the ashes of failure, much like the proverbial phoenix. The third and final part of the book, entitled `Towards Real Success', helps the reader to win the internal battle associated with failure. While the second part of the book helps to outwardly reinvent the individual for career success, the final section of the book helps the individual to cultivate a new perspective, a new outlook- on career failure. This part of the book encourages the reader to look upon failure as a learning experience, and as such, helps one to regard failure as a temporary setback that one can learn from.The authors have written a truly empowering book, one that entrepreneurs and professionals must read and keep alongside all the other books on career and entrepreneurial success, as there inevitably will be one or more notable, spectacular and in some cases unfortunately public failures on the path to a successful career journey. In the end, I can only say that there is no shame in taking a risk, giving one's all, and failing, and I wholeheartedly believe that true shame results from failing to try, failing to risk, fearing change, and failing to grow. These, I truly believe, are the things that comprise the regrets in one's life.",

                "review/text": "I read an excerpt from this book in the Reader's Digest in the spring before I was fired from a job where I had been both a professional and personal failure. (It was for a company that had asked much and gave nothing in return, but it still hurt) In addition, my long-dysfunctional marriage was on the rocks, and it was just a matter of time before he would leave me since I was no longer a breadwinner and able to be his meal ticket. Pretty pathetic, huh? I found the book while on a getaway to Toronto, and worked through it as well as Richard Bolles' What Color is Your Parachute? over the next couple of months. I knew I still wanted to work with people--just not in mental health--and the examples of what career counselors did with people in this book really sparked a long-dormant interest in doing that myself. With a little bit of luck, a lot of prayer, and a lot of help from this book in facing my failures, looking at what I still had going for me, and, as the authors call it, &quot;relabeling,&quot; I hit the interview circuit. The best opportunity and the one I was most excited about involved doing educational/career counseling with low-income, first-generation college-bound adults. They took a chance on me, and it was the best job I've ever had, bar none. (I left it to marry and move to a larger city) I recommend this one, along with the Richard Bolles book, for anyone who's just been jarred out of their skull from being fired, downsized, abandoned, or just plain told, &quot;you're a failure.&quot; As the back cover says, &quot;when SMART people fail, often they've taken the first step toward renewed success.&quot; It was that way for me. . .hope it is for you, too:)",

It lays out the stages most people experience when they've been fired, downsized, or eliminated -- shock, fear, anger & blame, shame, and despair. It addresses how failure changes the balance of power in a relationship, and how it affects men and women differently. It then moves to how we reinvent ourselves -- identifying the cause of failure, reinterpreting the event, relabeling yourself, and getting unstuck. There are numerous stories, including the authors' own, about failing and ultimately coming back better and stronger. One quote especially resonated with me: David Brown (he produced The Sting and Jaws, among other Hollywood blockbusters) was fired three times from top jobs. \"Each time, [he] was stunned. And each time he never stopped to analyze what had caused him to be fired in the first place. Only after the third time did he begin to examine his working behavior. Why was he always running after corporate jobs...when in the end they held neither safety nor a degree of control over one's fate?\" Whether you feel that corporate life is truly your calling, or you yearn for something different, this book can help you push past self-imposed limitations and re-invent your career in a unique and satisfying way.",

It's simply the best book on the subject I've read. The author has a huge heart for seniors and those who work with them--professionals, certainly, but also neighbors, friends, children, grandchildren.If you're looking for a book on how to manhandle or finesse the elderly into doing what you want (even for their own good), then this isn't for you. Solie explains the new goals seniors face as they contemplate their lives--often alone, as peers and spouses die--and the twin conflicting motivations they must wrangle with--the need for control, and the need to let go. Walking us through their worlds--a world that, if we're honest, we can't but guess at--Solie gently prods us to reevaluate WHY we are communicating so poorly, and how we can improve. In the end, it is we who must change, especially our instinct to bully the senior into a more comfortable situation (usually for US, but as always, \"for their own good\").Respect, love, sympathy, and cheer shine out of his writing and text. I read it in one sitting, and found myself in tears. Why didn't I have this book when my mother was still alive?",

Such attempts often fail because of the different agendas held by the middle-aged and the elderly. Mr Solie has unearthed two principal motives in elderly people's verbal and non-verbal behavior - to maintain control over their lives, and to discover their legacy, or how they will be remembered.The book's approach is logical. Theory is presented, examples of miscommunication are provided, and solutions (or, at the very least, reasonable alternative approaches) are offered. Mr Solie suggests that the reader looks first at the sections that most directly apply to a particular situation, and then returns to the theoretical underpinnings for adapting their behavior. Everyone - whatever age - can relate to the examples chosen, and I submit that everyone can learn from the solutions offered. The writing is clear, simple, and pithy. I particularly liked the apt quotations used in the chapter headings. As a 73-year-old, I cannot recommend this book too highly.",

I have been so effected by her work that I have purchased 15 or 20 copies (I am losing track) and regularly give the book to persons in my life or whom I cross paths with. That action puts my money where my mouth is.This book speaks volumes and has truth for the taking. I am in the midst of my own awakening and this book is a marvelous travel guide.

Instead of focusing strictly on physical changes, it touches on issues that affect us, both men and women in midlife, in a larger sense: the search for wholeness, losses and death, continuing growth strategies, and relationships. It then goes on to give us techniques for enriching our lives that include dreamwork, creativity, and spirituality.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in making the second half of their life as rich as or richer than the first half. Too often the focus at this time of life is on our losses--physical changes, death of friends and family members, role changes, and career stagnation. This book shows us how to focus on the positive aspects of growing older. It's a time when we can recreate our lives in the present, discover our true potential, and return to who we really are.",

Describing it as the emergence of our `unlived selves', he suggests that it's built into the structure of the Self, and is a unique opportunity for growth. As carefully crafted public masks crumble as our `shadow' - beliefs and behaviors repressed through social conditioning - seek release and authentic expression.The poet Robert Bly who wroteA Little Book on the Human Shadow, notes that we spend half our lives putting parts of ourselves into the shadow and the other half trying to take them out again. Its no surprise that lives built on false foundations can dramatically upset our balance!Midlife still catches most of people by surprise, and is often misdiagnosed and misjudged. Therapists who fail to recognize its complexity may treat it as depression with Prozac, without understanding it as a necessary part of the journey to individual growth. This book offers a holistic viewpoint of midlife as a search for wholeness, and includes exercises for ways to give unexpressed parts of yourself a voice.The good news is that midlife requires only three things of us: integrity, trust, and courage. A bite-sized prescription of how to navigate the passage smoothly might be summed up as: Act in alignment with your insights.",

            {
                "review/text": "Frederic Flach, M.D., graduated from Cornell University Medical College where he currently serves as Adjunct Associate Professor of Psychiatry. He is an attending psychiatrist at the Payne Whitney Clinic of New York Hospital and of St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center. He has written numerous books on resilience and the survivor personality, with a particular emphasis on the management of stress throughout one's life.This 234-page book is clearly written and well laid out, with a table of contents, index and bibliography. Dr. Flach starts the book with an introduction explaining the concept of resilience, which he defines as the &quot;psychological and biological strengths required to successfully master change.&quot; In the modern, fragmented, urban world that 95% of us in the U.S. live in today, no topic could be more significant. Dr. Flach has spent years studying how people cope with major catastrophes and terrible hardships, as well as potentially dangerous major turning points in their lives. He has discovered that there are common personality traits of people who are resilient/survivors, including:--creativity--a high ability to tolerate pain, emotional and physical--self-insight--self-respect--self-esteem and the ability to restore it when it is diminished or temporarily lost--a capacity for learning--the ability to make and keep friends--the ability to cooperate and inter-depend on others without being dependent--a vital, evolving perspective on interpreting the events in one's life and giving them meaning--a willingness to utilize crisis and suffering as an opportunity to heal old wounds, discover new ways to approach life and make themselves over--a body able to deal with the physical strains of the stress response--a willingness to &quot;appropriately collapse&quot; in the face of a significant amount of stress and change (take time to experience the extent of the problem on all levels)--an ability to contain within reasonable limits the amount of disruption in their lives due to the stress and change--a desire to directly and practically attempt to reassemble the pieces of their lives after collapsing and containing the disruption--a support network out in the world and a willingness to seek help when they need it, from friends, family or mental health or medical professionalsI find Dr. Flach's theoretical framework fascinating, informative and very useful, to wit: that it is a fact of life in nature that the physical world we are all part of is made up of endless cycles of disruption and reintegration. As human beings with physical bodies, living in the physical world, no matter how brilliantly and creatively we have managed to seemingly defy and work against the natural reality, it remains, always, within and around us. Thus we continually face crisis (the end of a cycle in our life, which demands that we change in response to a newly entering, different reality), and stress (the response of the body to any demand made upon it).Dr. Flach provides an clear, easily understandable, compelling discussion of both these issues. I found his remarks on stress an excellent expansion on the huge body of literature on this topic written over the past 30-40 years. And I found extremely profound and useful the way he ties stress and disruption-reintegration together by explaining, very clearly, the concept of homeostasis. This, he states, is the innate drive within all living creatures, including humans, to maintain themselves in states of coherence, that is, to return to the status quo after being disturbed. This self-preserving, adaptive capacity is in all of us, and it is essential that we use it, rather than fighting against it, to maintain physical and mental health.If you were to read only one book on the subject of resilience, this would be a very good choice. It is easy to read, and it makes a logical, concise, clear argument that is consistent throughout. Dr. Flach draws practical, meaningful conclusions, based on his professional experience with thousands of patients and his own professional research, and offers simple, understandable, practical suggestions for ways to survive and grow in the face of the inevitable stress and change we all face constantly.",

And the good news is that Flach assures us is that the \"most encouraging observation I've made over these years is that resilience is a strength most of us can develop through thought and practice.\"What is resilience? Flach tells us that it is \"the strengths we require to master cycles of disruption [emotional upset caused by stressful events such as a family death, divorce, or job loss] and reintegration [putting the pieces of our life back together] throughout our lives.\" This book offers simple and practical advice on HOW to perfect those strengths that we all have within us.In this book, some of the things you will discover are as follows:(1) Over a dozen traits that will make you more resilient(2) Why giving into stress and \"falling apart\" may be the best step to take on the road to resilience(3) Why the use of prescription drugs may not be the best choice in removing the psychological pain caused by stress(4) Why creative problem solving is a major part of resilience(5) The factors in our environment needed to facilitate resilience.A remarkable quality of this book is that it is easy to read and thus easy to learn from. There is no confusing technical psychobabble. The most interesting aspect of this book is that Flach uses some of his actual patient studies to illustrate his practical advice. Also, there is a large reference section if the reader wants to learn more.In conclusion, this book will change the way you think about stress FOREVER.+++++",

                "review/text": "This is a very encouraging book once you get past the use of the word \"resilience,\" which, at first might seem to imply that the individual lacks \"resilience\" in the general use of the term. This is not how Flach uses it.Flach does not \"blame\" the parents. He points out, that if you did happen to have bad experiences in your past, you do need to recognize and deal with them. He firmly puts the ability to do this, with help if need be, with the reader. The ultimate lesson - it is not only natural, it is a vital part of life to experience problems, hurts, trials, depression, etc. and to move on. Every time we move on, our resilience grows stronger and makes us a more whole and stronger person. If we don't deal with our current or past problems and hurts, we do not grow and our resilience does not grow leading us to possibly greater trouble in the future.All people go through moments of crisis that they must pass. And Flach wants everyone to know that they not only can make it through, but triumph and grow to a better tomorrow.I think this book should be read after reading \"The Secret Strength of Depression\" EXPECIALLY if a person has to deal with depression in themselves or another (which they do, even if they don't realize it Flach points out :) ). Flach first addresses \"resilience\" here and I think it sets the tone. ALSO, Flach gives a very different and USEFULL interpretation of depression. Depression is NOT very intense negative emotions. It is NOT a very intense low mood. It is not emotions or mood. By separating issues that confuse healing, Flach encourages the individual that they can get better.Flach is a religious man and it shows in some of his writing in these books (he has other, overtly religious, writings) but it is not overbearing - this is a man who had to council both religious (sometimes dangerously so, as Flach gives a case study of a young man destroyed by guilt) and non-religious individuals.Like Flach's other book, \"The Secret Strength of Depression,\" the fundamental idea comes across early and the reader can finish the book quite quickly as the flow makes it easy to skip what does not apply to you in particular.",

So I was hoping to gain new ideas and perhaps be able to recommend a new book.Since I don't live in California, I didn't recognize Huffington's name from her gubernatorial race. I don't know her name or politics.On Becoming Fearless seems to be a collection of random thoughts, interspersed with brief essays from celebrities and notables. Alas, publishers like names more than ideas and revere fame more than substance.The chapter on aging seems at best irrelevant and at worst insensitive. Huffington begins by noting the Greek respect for elders. True, many cultures do revere elders (although I wonder how long that pattern will continue). But that's not relevant to most of us.Don't look in the mirror, Huffington says. Accept yourself. But she acknowledges her use of detox processes (yuk) and the services of a very special esthetician (beyond reach and pocketbook of most aging women).In another example, the chapter on money sings the familiar song of passion and abundance. While many people are held back by fear, a little healthy caution can save others from disastrous moves. Some people handle risk better than others. Some come up with realistic dreams while others build castles in the air.Bottom Line: I was disappointed in my quest for a new book to recommend. If you want to read a really good book on fear, get Thom Rutledge's book, Embracing Fear. Or read one of Harriet Lerner's books.What's really scary is that fluff and New Age-y books are so quick to attract publishers and ultimately readers.",

But I am so dang impressed and cannot recommend the book highly enough.Her writing style is easy to read, to the point an hour has gone by before you realize how long you have been reading. I like her honesty and kindness, in discussing events and even people who may have 'hurt' her in one way or another.There isn't one chapter that isn't interesting. Being a new widow I was pleased to see her discussing God, which some have relegated to those who are conservative Christians. On page 161 she reminds the reader that here in the states 70% of us belong to some type of religious organization and 40% attend weekly services. Which may not seem very high until you see that less than 10% in most European countries do. She quotes Jeffrey Kluger who in his 2004 Times article 'Is God in Our Genes?', is that often religious groups gather not as a congregation but more like camps, even armed ones. Here chapter on Fearless About Leadership and Speaking Out is good and something I think more Americans should do.In her Fearless Parenting chapter she writes about the myth of the supermom. Which I have to admit I think has been something some (some) feminists have suggested women can indeed be. Have it all moms. As a stay at home Mom, homeschooler, I know I don't think women can have it all anymore than men can. Parenting for me is a full time job, and not one I want to hire someone else to do. Just wish that women who choose to be stay at home moms would be given respect and also not looked upon as being outside the world around them. Most if not all the homeschooling families I know have women who are better informed than most of their counterparts outside the home.Fearless About Money is an interesting chapter and I like that on page 125 that when you give you receive. Which is along the lines of tithing for me or the adage you need to spend money to make money in business.

Some thoughts to consider while reading this out-of-place chapter:An atheist's life is not emotionally unbearable, filled with fear or a barren terrain. It is in fact a life that is appreciated and wondrous considering that we only get to live it once.Life has meaning without god. With no god to concern myself with - I find I have much more time for meaningful endeavors and enjoyment without the pall of fear always hanging about. I don't need a supernatural being to give my life meaning - it has meaning in and of itself.She obviously hasn't read or spoken in depth to anyone who is an atheist. She has one agenda and bias towards faith, thus lending no credibility to her assumption that those without faith are unhappy - and that does nothing to change that faith is nothing more than wishful thinking. She goes from being a woman of intellectual integrity to a little girl who believes in wishful thinking and wants the rest of us to do so.People of faith have a need to falsely state how unhappy, misguided and empty atheists must be. They seem to want us to join in the misery of fear and submission that faith seems to promote.It is fearless to face the possibility that there is no god. It is fearless to live life as it is, to rely on yourself, living in reality with no seeking out of some mythical presence. It is fearless to know that you get one life and to make the most of it for yourself and others with no promise of an afterlife.I wouldn't even bother reading this chapter - it only serves to undo what she is setting out to do by writing the book. The book would have gotten fives stars if not for that one chapter.",

                "review/text": "Arianna Huffington could be a role model for any modern woman. She's written ON BECOMING FEARLESS as an invitation to her daughters, Christina and Isabella, to live openly and bravely.Huffington has never feared the consequences of her political convictions. \"At the heart of my political transformation was my recognition that the task of overcoming poverty and social injustice is too monumental to be achieved without the power and scale that only government can provide. Along with this came the conviction that silence is not an option.\" Huffington has never allowed herself to be silenced. She addresses her adversaries with verve and mental acuity, and is known for her bulldog tenacity in facing conflict. It is no surprise to learn that she headed the debating society at Cambridge University.In this book she lays out some gutsy principles to live by. Demystify money and don't let it rule your life. Don't be afraid of aging: \"fifty really is the new thirty.\" Be fearless with the possibility of power; Arianna hasn't let men, like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 2003 race for governor of California, hold her back with the suggestion that she \"drink more decaf.\"Huffington has run for high office, made herself a known and to-be-reckoned-with face on our television screens, and has done so without sacrificing her femininity. She would perhaps say that stalking the corridors of political power and making demands of the system is at the very heart of femininity. Citing examples from the world of corporate America, Huffington shows us many exemplars of decisive, assertive women, and concludes, \"If you want to succeed big, there is no substitute for simply sticking your neck out.\"In her fifties, the author launched a dynamic website, The Huffington Post, quoting research that indicates that \"later in life more women than men are jumping in and starting new projects.\" She presents the example of Sherry Lansing, who \"with sixty looming\" began a new career in philanthropy, forming her own foundation devoted to cancer research. Throughout this nicely blended book (fact, opinion, humor and theory), Huffington generously gives praise to her friends and role models, particularly her mother, for whom fear was never an option.Huffington treats without hesitation that most profound of all \"what ifs\" --- the fear of death --- and in doing so summarizes her philosophy of fearlessness. \"Trusting that there is more to the world than what we can see and finding a way to connect to it can help us face our mortality with fearlessness and bring this fearlessness into everyday life.\"--- Reviewed by Barbara Bamberger Scott",

In reading On Becoming Fearless, I had the unexpected - and pleasurable - experience of taking a review of my life. Just like in a good therapy I found myself asking and reflecting on the following questions: \"Where have I been? Where am I now? Where do I want to be? The chapters hit all the important areas in a human life addressing issues around our bodies, our loves, our children, our work, our money, our aging, our spirituality. After completing my own personal therapy a dozen years ago the book was a refreshing opportunity to pick up again on the narratives of my own personal journey. Arianna Huffington is a wise and capable guide and it is clear that she cares deeply and compassionately for women and their well-being and happiness. Weaving her own story and those of other women throughout the chapters I played with adding my own voice into the conversation. This made me realize how important it is for women to start or join an ongoing women's group. And Arianna has made it especially easy for us as she has already given us the syllabus!!",

        "description": "As women, we know how important it is to take charge of our health care-to be informed and proactive. But too often we forget that our mental wellness is an integral part of our overall health. The Complete Guide to Mental Health for Women is the definitive resource for women looking for answers to their mental health questions, whether those questions concern a disorder like depression or adjusting to major life changes like motherhood or divorce. Drawing on the latest thinking in psychiatry and psychology, written for women of diverse backgrounds, The Complete Guide to Mental Health for Women begins with Part One, the life cycle, helping women understand the major issues and biological changes associated with young adulthood, middle age, and old age. Specific entries address the psychological importance of women's sexuality, relationships, motherhood, childlessness, trauma, and illness and discuss how social contexts, such as poverty and racism, inevitably affect mental health. Part Two explores specific mental disorders, including those, like postpartum depression, related to times when women are particularly vulnerable to mental illness. Part Three takes a closer look at biological treatments-including the use of antidepressants, and various types of psychotherapy-from cognitive behavioral treatments to EMDR and beyond. The Complete Guide to Mental Health for Women ends with a section on life enhancements-because the activities that help us live fuller, more vital lives are also essential to our mental health. The Complete Guide to Mental Health for Women * Draws on the knowledge and practical experience of more than fifty psychologists and psychiatrists * Helps women think through the psychological challenges inherent in the life cycle, from young adulthood through old age * Focuses on key life issues, from sexuality and relationships to trauma and racism * Provides important information on mental disorders, their biological treatments, and psychotherapeutic interventions * Includes a comprehensive list of psychotropic medications, targeted reading suggestions, crucial online resources, and support groups The Complete Guide to Mental Health for Women covers what every woman should know about: * Aging. What should I expect from menopause? What do I need to know about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy? * Pregnancy. How will becoming a mother change me? How do I overcome postpartum depression? * Childlessness. What if I don't want to be a mother? * Sexuality. Is a \"female Viagra\" the solution to women's sexual complaints? How does societal ambivalence about women's sexuality affect me? * Body Image and Eating Disorders. Are all eating disorders a reaction to societal pressures to be thin? * Polypharmacy. Why are some patients prescribed more than one type of psychotropic drug? Is this overmedicating? * Finding a Psychotherapist. How do I know if a therapist is right for me? And how do I know what type of therapy I need? * Anger. Why is it the most difficult emotion for many women to express? * EMDR. What exactly is EMDR?

I can't believe that he mentions specific anti-depressants by name, and at least one of those anti-depressant companies (Zoloft) is handing the book out to drs' offices for free. The author is in favor of MOST women being on antidepressants and hormone therapy, which I think should certainly be an individual decision.The last 20 or so pages about how to de-stress your life are good, for people who've never heard of getting out of debt, downsizing, cutting down on kids' crazy extracurricular activities...but, here again, it's all been said before, and better, by original authors.

Brain tumor?Test after medical test showed me to be quite healthy, with no discernable problems. When doctors suggested \"stress,\" I dismissed it as a junk diagnosis, thinking \"why don't you just say you don't know instead of blaming stress for everything.\" Turns out, though, that they were right.Stress is much, much worse for us than previously imagined. It does not just affect us primarily mentally or with the occassional headache or indigestion...it can profoundly alter our body to the point of near disability. I know -- because it has happened to me.This book came as a godsend in helping me understand what was happening to my body, and why. It was the book that opened my eyes to the connection between stress and the adrenal glands, and the profound affect that prolonged exposure to stress can have on our hormonal system. Many physicians poo-poo the idea that the adrenals can eventually become exhausted because they reason that adrenaline goes up (not down) when the body is under stress. Hart shows that while such reasoning is correct, it is only half correct. Eventually, the body can no longer sustain the continual demand for over-production of adrenaline and the body will crash. When that happens, the physical results are profoundly severe.Although Hart spends less time in the book dealing with the most serious stage of stress exhaustion - adrenal depletion - he was the first author that alerted me to this very real condition, and hence helped me on my journey to finding out what was wrong and how to get much-needed help for recovery from a debilitating condition.Most have been conditioned to believe that stress will only manifest itself as eventual coronary problems. While this is true for some people - the heart attack out of the blue - there are a host of other physical symptoms that while perhaps not life-threatening, can render a person's quality of life completely destroyed. There is a significant body of evidence, for example, to show that chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia are simply the body's response to prolonged, chronic, unresolved stress.I believe that anyone who deals with stress - from mild to severe - will benefit from this book. Knowing the dangers and warning signals of too much stress are vitally important in today's ultra-demanding pace of life.My only critique is that I wished he would have discussed the concept of adrenal fatigue or adrenal exhaustion in more detail. However, that topic is adequately addressed in other books - particularly \"Chronic Fatigue Unmasked\" by Gerald Poesnecker.",

Not only did this book help me to identify with the adrenaline/stress issues, but it pointed to a way out. Yes, I found it helpful that every bit of helpful advice does not have to come in a bottle of pills; though I am not knocking medications for needed issues. Stress is something that we can choose to perceive as impending doom, or a little skip in the road. Archibald Hart does a very nice job showing how some Biblically related principles can help one to overcome stress. We were not wired for all of this anhedonia in the first place.I would hesitate to have a few of my \"Type H\" friends read this book at certain times. Hostile or hyper people are sometimes hoping to keep their adrenaline pumped for reasons of performance, and they are many times not worried about future problems that may result from this. They sure would be the fist to benefit from this, and I hope many will take the subtle information to heart. It is worth the timeless details of sorting thru, as one can still see that adrenaline is killing us in many ways. It does have many functions, but not at the levels and seemingly addicted ways of being maintained.Adrenaline junkies may actually find this book interesting. It won't keep you from loving your sport or adventure, but perhaps managing a few issues that friends or family have been hesitating to tell you!!Yes, this is a Christian directed book, but it does not have to serve believers only. I would see very little that would upset a totally secular audience, and actually have been a little less interested in a few of Archibald's meditation ideas. Those do not appeal to me quite as much, as it really seems more important to get to the root of the problem. The Stressor does not always have to be avoided or thrown out, rather looked upon with a healthy perspective.Yeah, now that is getting to the root of the issue.",

        "Title": "the dance of deception pretending and truthtelling in womens lives",
        "description": "When The Dance of Deceptionwas published, Lerner discovered that women were not eager to identify with the subject. \"Well, I don't do deception\" was a common resonse. We all \"do deception\", often with the intention to protect ourselves and the relationships we depend on. The Dance of Deceptionunravels the ways (and whys) that women show the false and hide the real -- even to our own selves. We see how relationships are affected by lying and faking, by silence and pretending and by brave -- but misguided -- efforts to tell the truth. Truth-telling is at the heart of what is most central in women's lives. It is at the foundation of authenticity and creativity, intimacy and joy. Yet in the name of \"honesty\", we can bludgeon each other. We can approach a difficult issue with such a poor sense of timing and tact that we can actually shut down the lines of communication rather than widening the path of truth-telling. Sometimes Lerner's advice takes a surprising turn -- for example, when she asks us to engage in a bold act of pretending in order to discover something \"more real\"; or when she tells us not to parachute down on our family to bring up a \"hot issue\" without laying the necessary groundwork first. Whether the subject is affairs, family secrets, sexual faking or the challenge of \"being oneself\", Lerner helps us to discover, speak and live our own truths.",

                "review/text": "Full disclosure: I'm a guy, and I read this book at a time when, in my early 20's, I was trying to understand, and come to grips with, my perception that several of my relationships with women (some strictly platonic, some not) were crippled by a certain lack of honesty. So feel free to discount my reaction to this book by whatever degree you feel appropriate, based on the perspective I brought to it. That said, I was disappointed and frustrated by what I found to be Lerner's somewhat shallow and defensive treatment of the topic. I'm oversimplifying a bit, but Lerner's basic philosophy, as presented in the book, seems to be: Dishonesty is often a good thing because not sharing hurtful truths can help you avoid hurting someone's feelings. E.g., not telling a friend that you think certain behavior patterns are harmful or unpleasant serves the &quot;greater truth&quot; that you nevertheless care about her and think she's a good person. Therefore, Lerner suggests, women who deceive the other people in their lives often aren't &quot;really&quot; lying, they're just being kind. Lerner doesn't really confront the ultimately circular nature of this argument. Nor does she provide any reasoned way of distinguishing between innocuous applications of this &quot;if you mean well, it isn't really a lie&quot; approach and more problematic ones. Telling a friend that you really like her disastrous new haircut, about which she's feeling self-conscious and vulnerable, is one thing. Not telling her that you've been deliberately excluding her from certain social situations because your other friends find her manipulative or overly critical is something else entirely. Nor does Lerner, IMHO, deal meaninfully with the question of whether deception that we rationalize on the grounds that it protects a friend from unpleasantness is not often, in reality, an attempt to protect ourselves from the emotional messiness of communicating hard truths. These aren't easy issues, and I don't claim to know the &quot;truth&quot;, or even that there is a single correct approach to dealing with them. But I was disappointed by Lerner's failure to grapple honestly with them.",

                "review/text": "Though this book is not new, I just discovered it. Having read it, I now take a different perspective on how 'honest' I am, and how I can approach more honesty - in healthy ways - in all of my relationships. I am not the typical image of 'feminism', in the negative ways the word has come to represent, but I do know that being a woman is an experience to be conscious of. Though it has a heavy feminist bent, one of the best things about this book is that it addresses more than just women's concerns. It tackles the many ways that we all deceive ourselves, and those we come into contact with. It addresses the issues of secrecy within families, 'faking' orgasm, playing out the scripts that we are given for life, and the important distinction between pretending and lying. I appreciated the suggestions about laying groundwork with others before approaching hard truths, and the concept of 'trying on' a different behavior in order to find out where our truths really are.As a fair assessment, I would say that it takes a while to get into the style or format of the book. It's not laid out in sequential order, so it took a few chapters to get totally engrossed. But the case studies, and her responses, rang true so many times, that I got to the point of almost being late for work because I couldn't put it down.I am married and work in a small non-profit with 3 men. I've shared several of my discoveries from the book with them, and had meaningful discussions with all. My ED even photocopied a few pages to share with his wife - another testimony to the concepts presented. You do need to be ready to read the book with an open attitude toward your own behaviors and ways of dealing with others. It's not always easy to admit to things we do, but don't want to claim. I would recommend this to anyone trying to sort out the best path to a whole, healthy, happy life.",

So I had to take a really deep breath and really THINK when I finally woke up to the idea that truth and honesty are not always what they should be. I took a good, long, ugly look at myself and realized that I use truth as a weapon, rather than as a tool. I am not always honest with people because I want to create a better relationship. I am sometimes honest just to be hurtful, to shock people, or to get attention away from whoever is monopolizing the conversation at the moment. Hm. Ugly!The problematic relationship (s) in my life are like cans. I can pick up a big ol' truth-sledgehammer and knock the heck out of that can, or I can use truth gently, like a can opener and let that can open up and get to what's inside.One option gives me the satisfaction of 'letting so and so have it' because I'm darn tired of biting my tongue and pretending that things are OK when they're NOT. And the other option lets me be honest, but gives the other person (the can) the chance of telling truth back to me, too.The feminist rhetoric falls short, as it always does with me. If you don't want to hang out in the kitchen and pop out babies, for heaven's sake, DON'T. But don't blame men if that's what you decide to do with your life and then change your mind later. Don't you think men change their minds about wanting to be married daddies sometimes, too? There is too much blaming going on. People need to own their lives. If you know your situation is messed up, you know enough to change it.Also, the whole thing about minorities and tokens rings very false when Lerner presents the statistic in her final chapter that women actually outnumber men in the world. So, hello? How can we consider to whine and consider ourselves a token or a minority when we are numerically superior? I don't really get that at all.Anyway. 4 stars. It's an eye-opener!",

I started with the body scan in chapter 3 and the daily feelings examen in chapter 4 and was amazed at how much these simple practices increased my awareness of what was going on. The amazing result was comfort. Then I noticed I felt more calm, confident and powerful where I often have felt anxious, wimpy and angry. Talk about a way to reduce stress! These simple first steps that even a way too busy person like me can fit into my day seem to start an upward spiral that little by little quickly leads to more energy and joy. The explanation of the science behind emotions is easy to understand and I found it totally fascinating. The information about ancient wisdom practices fed my spirit and I felt a little more connected to the universe. I've taken lots of management courses and read a lot of great sounding self-improvement programs, but this deceptively quiet, simple book really worked for me.

I had been Senior Class President, Top 2% in the Country during College, successful in modeling and acting, selected as Volunteer of the Year for the State of Iowa and the list of \"stuff\" could go on an on. I was so empty inside myself that I didn't any longer know how I felt inside. I was losing any sense of who I was.I'd become someone that functioned to serve, protect, nurture, encourage, forgive and love someone that couldn't love back. I was with the same person, in a marriage, for almost 5 years, and woke up one morning and realized that the person next to me was a stranger who didn't know the real me. The person that my life revolved around, the person that I chose to take care of and \"cover\" for, just liked having me around so I could pick up the pieces and paint a picture of a relationship and a family that was like \"Ozzie and Harriet\" so that others would think that everything was just fine. I can't stand the word \"fine\" anymore. Nothing in my life was fine and it wasn't until I hit bottom and read \"Codependent No More:How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself\", that my life began to change. The book answered all of my questions and caused me to look deeply at myself and my situation and evalute how sick I was. Yes, I was the sick one in the relationship too.I thought that I was doing everything right or doing what was right for my relationship. But I didn't ever consider that my own personal cup was empty and the only person who could fill it with healthy things was me. I didn't know that I was controlling others as I only saw myself as a caring and loving person. What had happened is that I went overboard-WAY overboard to the point that I had stopped eating, started using pills to medicate my pain and refused to make changes in my life.I was scared. I didn't want to be alone in life. What I didn't realize is that I was already alone. I wanted to love and be loved. After reading this incredible book, I realized that I wasn't being loved. I was being used and abused and I needed to hit this emotional bottom before I would accept help. My therapist advised me to purchase \"Codependent No More\", by Melody Beattie AND to read it. I almost felt odd going into the self-help are of the book store. Little did I know that the healthiest place in any book store is the aisle that reads \"Self Help\"!I owe my life to this book and I thank all of the wonderful people who contributed to the stories in this book, that allowed me to move out of my relationship and to enter a long recovery period. I am still in the care of a therapist. Sometimes I act in a codependent fashion. The difference, however, is that I now see red flags that prevent me from getting too deep into relationships that I reach a point where I lose myself.I offer this review to you as a gift. May this book help you, no matter what your circumstance, and may you take hold of your life again. You deserve to learn how to care for yourself. You deserve to be loved and to learn how to accept the beauty that comes with a healthy relationship.My Warmest Regards to ALL!Peter CanniceScottsdale, ArizonaEmail: Horsepete@aol.com",

                "review/text": "So far as I can tell, very few people could ever read this book without taking something positive away from it. And you don't have to be the product of a broken home, child abuse, neglect, or other serious trauma to see how the machinery of so-called \"codependency\" tweaks your life; always for the worse.Having read other peoples' reviews, I'm not sure where some of the negative \"cult\" comments and rancor come from. I recognized a lot of these behaviors in mysef and in my family, and I'm not from an abusive, alcoholic, or otherwise chemically shattered upbringing. I have good parents and I had a good childhood. Just the same, even good parents and a good childhood are no guarantee against developing unhealthy relationship habits, as well as damaging internal emotional processes.If you're like me, you shy away from \"self help\" literature because it all seems way too touchy-feely. I don't see myself as a victim, and I refuse to adopt the victim mentality. But nobody gives parents a rule book on setting healthy emotional boundaries with their kids, and kids that grow up in a home without healthy emotional boundaries become adults without healthy emotional boundaries. This can really get you into trouble when you start trying to form a family of your own, and is the reason why I sought out this book with urgency.Does it seem like your hapiness is too connected to how other people live their lives? Do you get really upset and depressed because those whom you love engage in behavior you see as risky or damaging? Feel powerless to stop your loved one from using or abusing mind altering substances? Tired of always feeling like \"the bad guy\" when you're just trying to get your partner to \"be good\"? Has your own social circle dwindled or vanished, so that now only your partner and his/her friends are 'your' social group? Would you like to know why it's so hard to get out of bed every morning, and why you spend so much time worrying about that certain person in your life, while worrying too little about yourself?The problem called \"co-odependency\" is not a catch-all, nor is it remedied over night. But I'd dare say that at least half or more of American adults--indeed adults across the entire world--struggle with some form of co-dependent-like behavior. And if you want a deeper insight into this problem, what it is, what it is not, and how it messes with your life, then read this book, and gain strength from understanding.Now, having said all this, and having dealt with these issues for a few years, I think I need to be honest and say that a book like this is only the FIRST STEP. Nothing replaces a good therapist or psychologist. If you feel like you really are that messed up or are \"going bonkers\", please, see about getting some professional counseling. When your car is broken do you try to fix it yourself? No, most of us do not. Not even those of us who are handy with cars. The same is true for psychological and emotional disturbances. Many companies now offer Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) that offset or eliminate the costs of counseling. If your company has an EAP, by all means, use it!Barring counseling, I would HIGHLY SUGGEST another book, once you have passed through the bowels of \"Codependent No More\" and are ready to move beyond merely identifying your problems, and are anxious to work on SOLVING them.To merely gaze at one's navel and bemoan the sorry state of one's broken or damaged history is to remain trapped in emotional and mental amber. You're not REALLY going to \"get better\" until you attack the unhealthy mental habits at the heart of the problem. Understanding the root of the trouble is just a first step, making changes for the better is what happens next, and ought to be the logical goal of EVERY person seeking relief from abnormal or extreme emotional and psychological disturbance.Which is why I highly, highly, highly, suggest seeking out the classic \"A Guide to Rational Living\" by PhD. Albert Ellis and PhD. Robert A. Harper. Whereas Beattie is good at giving a layman's view of co-dependent problems and guiding the unkowing through a tour of co-dependent issues, where they might come from, and how they affect our lives in the present, she is not technically a TRAINED professional in mental health care. Without seeking that kind of professional-level knowledge, one is very likely to fall into the \"Twelve Step Trap\" wherein 'recovery' becomes an asymptotic hell of forever progressing towards wellness, without actually attaining wellness.Doctors Ellis and Harper have the goods on making changes in your life RIGHT NOW, without facing a daunting and endless program of eternal Anonymous-type meetings and couch sessions with your shrink. Refreshingly pragmatic and frank, Ellis and Harper give you a toolbox full of solid instruments to help you start dismantling that co-dependent house you've built for yourself (yes, I said YOU built for YOURSELF), and avoiding taking on \"group\" and perpetual \"recovery\" as just another set of addictions or ways to avoid truly attaining mental and emotional health.Thanks for reading.

I think that causes many of us to accept her interpretation of things and accept her as an expert on the subject.

The one message that blasts loud and clear out of this book is CARE FOR NO ONE BUT YOURSELF. But then she says that caring for people is good. But don't do it. But you can still love them. But don't.

It just makes me feel bad that people may try to implement her ideas/advice in their lives to the destruction of their good relationships. She's advocating being alone -\"undependent\" of anyone - and taking the \"necessary\" steps to detach from these relationships. Some abusive relationships may need such severing, but Beattie casts the label of \"codependent\" under a wide enough umbrella to cover everyone. \"Everyone's codependent.\" So good relationships will be destroyed by following her advice, as well as bad ones. I think that down the road many people who follow her advice and alienate the people who love them in their effort to be \"undependent\" and \"detached\" will feel a deeper pain than the one that caused them to pick up this book in the first place.

(Except herself. She's above that now.) By the *extremely* broad list of codependent &quot;symptoms&quot; in this book, anyone who picks it up could be labeled as codependent. Also, calling it a &quot;progressive disease which can eventually lead to death&quot; is absolutely ludicrous, sky-high rhetoric.Worried about the misfortunes of your loved ones? Oh, you shameful, pathetic codependent. Care for someone else's well-being? You hopeless codependent. You must have had an alcoholic great grandfather. Are you crying? Only codependents cry. Does anyone else's behavior affect you in a way other than affirming your Nitzschean ubermenschen attitude? You are so codependent. Join a 12-step program now. Don't ever help someone who is sick or down on their luck or you'll be an enabler, or &quot;taking their inventory&quot; or whatever AA catch-phrase can be quickly thrown at you.Regardless of what Ms. Beattie says, loving yourself is not this complicated. Seek happiness within yourself, not this book.Avoid the Codependency Cult and be yourself.Caring is NOT a disease. While I agree that this book may have helped some people, it is not the solution for everyone. I think the solution always lies within the self. &quot;Codependent No More&quot; pathologizes the natural tendency to care for others, and perpetuates the dubious myth that a caring partner is responsible for an addicted person's behavior. No one can cause another person's addictive behavior, period. And being concerned about someone with addictive behaviors does not prove that you have a personality disorder. Read with caution, and don't allow this bunk to run your life...or you'll be codependent, ha ha.",

If life was that simple, counsellor's case loads would be much lighter and the world a much happier place.This book is an excellent starting point and great self-help book for those who are codependent. It is not simply a matter of &quot;starting to love yourself,&quot; but a matter of going back through the years, generally to the formative years of childhood, and discovering why you have developed the need to be codependent. In other words, it helps to know where you came from before mapping a route to where you are going. I did find the book made considerable reference to drug and alcohol addiction. While that is a major form of codependency, it is not the only form, but others received less priority. For that reason, the book lost a star in the rating. &quot;Codependent No More&quot; is written in an honest, straight-forward manner; therefore, if it evokes anger or negativism in the reader, it is likely because the reader sees at least a partial reflection of themself in the book.Like any self-help book, the advice given only works if the individual is prepared to make long-term changes and has the commitment to work at the root of the problem. For those who are codependent to a minor degree, this book provides helpful insight on how to deal with the problem; however, if the problem is a more serious one, opting for professional counselling is likely still the best course of action. Often old habits are difficult to change on one's own. Freeing yourself from the chains of codependency can result in newfound freedom, peace of mind and a happier, less stressful lifestyle. I do recommend this book for the valuable information it contains.",

                "review/text": "Instead of spending hours of your time, expressing how anxious and depressed I was, and for so many years, I'd share a few things that might tell my story of recovery in a more concise mode.I had everything but had nothing. I had been Senior Class President, Top 2% in the Country during College, successful in modeling and acting, selected as Volunteer of the Year for the State of Iowa and the list of \"stuff\" could go on an on. I was so empty inside myself that I didn't any longer know how I felt inside. I was losing any sense of who I was.I'd become someone that functioned to serve, protect, nurture, encourage, forgive and love someone that couldn't love back. I was with the same person, in a marriage, for almost 5 years, and woke up one morning and realized that the person next to me was a stranger who didn't know the real me. The person that my life revolved around, the person that I chose to take care of and \"cover\" for, just liked having me around so I could pick up the pieces and paint a picture of a relationship and a family that was like \"Ozzie and Harriet\" so that others would think that everything was just fine. I can't stand the word \"fine\" anymore. Nothing in my life was fine and it wasn't until I hit bottom and read \"Codependent No More:How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself\", that my life began to change. The book answered all of my questions and caused me to look deeply at myself and my situation and evalute how sick I was. Yes, I was the sick one in the relationship too.I thought that I was doing everything right or doing what was right for my relationship. But I didn't ever consider that my own personal cup was empty and the only person who could fill it with healthy things was me. I didn't know that I was controlling others as I only saw myself as a caring and loving person. What had happened is that I went overboard-WAY overboard to the point that I had stopped eating, started using pills to medicate my pain and refused to make changes in my life.I was scared. I didn't want to be alone in life. What I didn't realize is that I was already alone. I wanted to love and be loved. After reading this incredible book, I realized that I wasn't being loved. I was being used and abused and I needed to hit this emotional bottom before I would accept help. My therapist advised me to purchase \"Codependent No More\", by Melody Beattie AND to read it. I almost felt odd going into the self-help are of the book store. Little did I know that the healthiest place in any book store is the aisle that reads \"Self Help\"!I owe my life to this book and I thank all of the wonderful people who contributed to the stories in this book, that allowed me to move out of my relationship and to enter a long recovery period. I am still in the care of a therapist. Sometimes I act in a codependent fashion. The difference, however, is that I now see red flags that prevent me from getting too deep into relationships that I reach a point where I lose myself.I offer this review to you as a gift. May this book help you, no matter what your circumstance, and may you take hold of your life again. You deserve to learn how to care for yourself. You deserve to be loved and to learn how to accept the beauty that comes with a healthy relationship.My Warmest Regards to ALL!Peter CanniceScottsdale, ArizonaEmail: Horsepete@aol.com",

If you find yourself caretaking all the time, ie: thinking or feeling responsible for other people, feel it is your responsiblity to help other people solve their problems, feel needy people are always attracted to you, and feeling unappreciated or used; or you have weak boundaries with the people in your life; you have dependency issues; poor communication; and low self-worth- you are codependent. I didn't think I was, but this book laied my life out perfectly. If you are feeling crazy for the way you are feeling read this book and you will understand why you are feeling the way you are.

                "review/text": "So far as I can tell, very few people could ever read this book without taking something positive away from it. And you don't have to be the product of a broken home, child abuse, neglect, or other serious trauma to see how the machinery of so-called \"codependency\" tweaks your life; always for the worse.Having read other peoples' reviews, I'm not sure where some of the negative \"cult\" comments and rancor come from. I recognized a lot of these behaviors in mysef and in my family, and I'm not from an abusive, alcoholic, or otherwise chemically shattered upbringing. I have good parents and I had a good childhood. Just the same, even good parents and a good childhood are no guarantee against developing unhealthy relationship habits, as well as damaging internal emotional processes.If you're like me, you shy away from \"self help\" literature because it all seems way too touchy-feely. I don't see myself as a victim, and I refuse to adopt the victim mentality. But nobody gives parents a rule book on setting healthy emotional boundaries with their kids, and kids that grow up in a home without healthy emotional boundaries become adults without healthy emotional boundaries. This can really get you into trouble when you start trying to form a family of your own, and is the reason why I sought out this book with urgency.Does it seem like your hapiness is too connected to how other people live their lives? Do you get really upset and depressed because those whom you love engage in behavior you see as risky or damaging? Feel powerless to stop your loved one from using or abusing mind altering substances? Tired of always feeling like \"the bad guy\" when you're just trying to get your partner to \"be good\"? Has your own social circle dwindled or vanished, so that now only your partner and his/her friends are 'your' social group? Would you like to know why it's so hard to get out of bed every morning, and why you spend so much time worrying about that certain person in your life, while worrying too little about yourself?The problem called \"co-odependency\" is not a catch-all, nor is it remedied over night. But I'd dare say that at least half or more of American adults--indeed adults across the entire world--struggle with some form of co-dependent-like behavior. And if you want a deeper insight into this problem, what it is, what it is not, and how it messes with your life, then read this book, and gain strength from understanding.Now, having said all this, and having dealt with these issues for a few years, I think I need to be honest and say that a book like this is only the FIRST STEP. Nothing replaces a good therapist or psychologist. If you feel like you really are that messed up or are \"going bonkers\", please, see about getting some professional counseling. When your car is broken do you try to fix it yourself? No, most of us do not. Not even those of us who are handy with cars. The same is true for psychological and emotional disturbances. Many companies now offer Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) that offset or eliminate the costs of counseling. If your company has an EAP, by all means, use it!Barring counseling, I would HIGHLY SUGGEST another book, once you have passed through the bowels of \"Codependent No More\" and are ready to move beyond merely identifying your problems, and are anxious to work on SOLVING them.To merely gaze at one's navel and bemoan the sorry state of one's broken or damaged history is to remain trapped in emotional and mental amber.

                "review/text": "Although this book may give some very healthy affirmations for people who are involved with people who have substance abuse problems, or people in abusive relationships and how to detach from them, I wouldn't dare consider this a book for the average depressed or lonely person.Beattie's definition of what codependency is in this book is almost laughable in its attempt to tag everyone in the world as a codependent. (Except herself. She's above that now.) By the *extremely* broad list of codependent &quot;symptoms&quot; in this book, anyone who picks it up could be labeled as codependent. Also, calling it a &quot;progressive disease which can eventually lead to death&quot; is absolutely ludicrous, sky-high rhetoric.Worried about the misfortunes of your loved ones? Oh, you shameful, pathetic codependent. Care for someone else's well-being? You hopeless codependent. You must have had an alcoholic great grandfather. Are you crying? Only codependents cry. Does anyone else's behavior affect you in a way other than affirming your Nitzschean ubermenschen attitude? You are so codependent. Join a 12-step program now. Don't ever help someone who is sick or down on their luck or you'll be an enabler, or &quot;taking their inventory&quot; or whatever AA catch-phrase can be quickly thrown at you.Regardless of what Ms. Beattie says, loving yourself is not this complicated. Seek happiness within yourself, not this book.Avoid the Codependency Cult and be yourself.Caring is NOT a disease. While I agree that this book may have helped some people, it is not the solution for everyone. I think the solution always lies within the self. &quot;Codependent No More&quot; pathologizes the natural tendency to care for others, and perpetuates the dubious myth that a caring partner is responsible for an addicted person's behavior. No one can cause another person's addictive behavior, period. And being concerned about someone with addictive behaviors does not prove that you have a personality disorder. Read with caution, and don't allow this bunk to run your life...or you'll be codependent, ha ha.",

If life was that simple, counsellor's case loads would be much lighter and the world a much happier place.This book is an excellent starting point and great self-help book for those who are codependent. It is not simply a matter of &quot;starting to love yourself,&quot; but a matter of going back through the years, generally to the formative years of childhood, and discovering why you have developed the need to be codependent. In other words, it helps to know where you came from before mapping a route to where you are going. I did find the book made considerable reference to drug and alcohol addiction. While that is a major form of codependency, it is not the only form, but others received less priority. For that reason, the book lost a star in the rating. &quot;Codependent No More&quot; is written in an honest, straight-forward manner; therefore, if it evokes anger or negativism in the reader, it is likely because the reader sees at least a partial reflection of themself in the book.Like any self-help book, the advice given only works if the individual is prepared to make long-term changes and has the commitment to work at the root of the problem. For those who are codependent to a minor degree, this book provides helpful insight on how to deal with the problem; however, if the problem is a more serious one, opting for professional counselling is likely still the best course of action. Often old habits are difficult to change on one's own. Freeing yourself from the chains of codependency can result in newfound freedom, peace of mind and a happier, less stressful lifestyle. I do recommend this book for the valuable information it contains.",

        "description": "Do you know someone who... Has trouble being close to others? Has a strong need to be right - all the time? Acts self-centered and egotistical? Never asks for help? Has to look good all the time? Works long hours but never finishes? Expects perfection in self and others? Seldom appears vulnerable or weak? Has difficulty relaxing? If so, this person may suffer from counter-dependency, the little-known flip side of co-dependency. The Flight from Intimacy, by psychologists Janae and Barry Weinhold, reveals counter-dependency as the major barrier to creating intimate relationships. People with counter-dependent behaviors appear strong, secure, and successful on the outside, while on the inside they feel weak, fearful, insecure, and needy. They function well in the world of business but often struggle in intimate relationships. Being in a relationship with this kind of person can be extremely frustrating. The Flight from Intimacy shows readers how to recognize and cope with counter-dependent people. And if you recognize yourself in the description above, this book will help you learn how to change. It teaches readers how to use committed relationships to heal childhood wounds and provides proven ways to use conflicts as opportunities for creating intimate, partnership relationships.",

                "review/text": "Much has been written about \"co-dependency\" in our society, but this was the first I had heard of \"counter-dependency.\" I think many who have been trying to understand themselves through a \"closed circle\" type of co-dependency model will find this fairly new concept more recognizable and therefore be able to better help themsleves.The Weinholds place a very strong importance on the early developmental process of young children. It will perhaps be difficult for people to accept that the very things that are necessary to survive --as a single parent, as a parent married to a military spouse, a parent married to a traveling business person, or parents in tension filled or conflict riddled relationships--can and DO create harmful patterns and cycles in children, ranging from a rebellious independence and a fear of being smothered to a fearfullness of abandonment.But it is a necessary first step to recognize that modern life situations that interfere or interupt a child's developing sense of self are built in to our culture. Work long and hard, often to the detriment of one's self and/or family.Once you begin reading, if you are honest, you realize how much of what we do and think and believe is tied to either co- dependent issues or counter-dependent issues. The beauty is that once the recognition is made, there are several, albeit intense and unique, strategies to take you back into the time of hurt to heal the inner child all within a committed relationship. Perhaps this is what was most powerful of all their ideas and explanations; it was not to leave the relationship and family you already have, but to heal from within that committed place, since most anxieties tended to be born from this kind of intimacy. You can't heal what you can't face, for example, like finally facing your fear of flying by actually flying and relief when you have the realization that you didn't die after all and are if fact OK.Counter-dependency is pervasive and perhaps the next step in our reflection of who we are and how we got to where we are. It isn't labled as a diease, but rather a conditioning of the small child that later plays havoc in our adult lives as we continue subconsciously to try and get that which we \"missed out on.\"The Weinholds also go into great depth about the traumas of abuse and neglect on children and the familiy dramas that they live in. They offer intense strategies for individuals to work through to heal themselves of these pains within a safe relationship. They offer a positive message about how to have and maintain a good emotional and physical sex life.It is not a pretty mirror to gaze into a first, but it will draw you in through a curiosity or a personal connection. You will recognize aspects of yourself, your partner, your family and friends. I thought about the lyrics to many songs I am familiar with and realized I could hear the voice of America's youth crying out for healing from painful parenting--subjects like not being able to live up to parental expectations, to parental abandonment, and promises to be better with their own kids than their parents had done to them, etc. Perhaps the Weinholds have truly hit upon something that could change they way we live forever.",

I like the \"Socratic Method\"-asking the right questions to create clarity in ones thinking. \"Logical/Empirical Approach\" is also an effective way of dispelling inappropriate thoughts about oneself. For instance, if you believe that you're performing poorly at work, then you have to start \"testing\" the validity of such belief.Choosing to live has offered a lot of strategies-ventilation, mobilizing support networks, and distraction-that sound reasonable and easy to do.

One is urged to shed the various nefarious social systems which have operated on one since birth causing untold Stress, to find one's True Self, and to return to those very systems, mostly family and work, a new recharged and in-charge person. According to the authors, most simply need to go through a self-assessment process and thought experiments to reveal Personal Visions for the future.Nowhere in the book do the authors discuss the power dynamics of the broader economy, society, and the polity and the impacts on persons. Managers are depicted not as powerful players in organizations who demand adherence to rules but as employee allies who want you to achieve your self-defined goals. Perhaps the authors could have reflected on the reason that labor unions formed. Or perhaps they could have pondered as to why social-democratic political parties exist in most democratic societies. The answer is most certainly not that corporations are interested in your True Self. Try the fact that workers and citizens need help against powerful players.The authors operate a company that sells Whole Person Technology out of which comes a Personal Vision. Their customers are mostly large corporations which only adds suspicion about whom is to benefit. In fact, most of their individual customers seem to find happiness where they were previously unhappy. How convenient. For the readers of this book a battery of tests is available on CD for the tidy sum. The book has an unmistakable feel of being a promo for their self-help products.In addition, the book is clearly intended for professionals, executives, managers, knowledge workers, etc. The book is loaded with snippets of case studies of such workers. Of course, they all found their Personal Vision. Apparently blue-collar workers don't have near the need to find a True Self.Is the book completely bogus. No. It is Briggs-Myers on the cheap. Yes, distinctions between introversion and extroversion, specialization and generalization, logical and spontaneous, etc are minimally presented. If someone was hopelessly in the wrong job, perhaps that would be seen by reading this book ignoring the question of how he or she got there in the first place. But the book greatly oversimplifies the ability of individuals to make major transformations in their lives. I suspect that for most the costs and risks, resources and information available, and the power to affect change make real changes nearly impossible. And books that oversimplify the problems do not help.",

When you buy this book, get a notebook or journal to go along with it. That will greatly increase the value of the concepts.The authors have crafted what they call the Personal Vision Process, made up of eight components: your natural talents and abilities, skills and life experience, interests, personality, values, goals, family history, and your stage of life development. It is a very comprehensive model and draws on solid work in developmental psychology.I think the previous review was off-base that called into question the authors' work. It's clear they have done their homework, and if you're looking for career direction, don't you want a guide that is fairly optimistic and supportive?The authors have developed a CD called the Highlands Ability Battery that profiles your own ability pattern. I purchased this separately and completed the process. It was very helpful to do this with a trained consultant. The book has a self-assessment in it that you can complete, but I found the personal feedback from the consultant much more nuanced and customized to me.Back to my first statement: this book is for those serious about gaining self-awareness of their abilities and setting their life/career direction.

I just want to say to everyone considering this book that I am the kind of person who absolutely HATES self-help books. I think they are for whiny idiots who are lazy and want a self-esteem boost without actually doing anything worthwhile. That being said, this book was a Godsend. I do not consider it to be 'false sense of esteem' self-help, but rather, a book which guides you into helping yourself as long as you are willing to do the work. It took me 6 months to complete the work here and, therefore the book. I WAS under the guidance of a career counselor AND had taken the abilities battery test first though. I know some people don't have access to that (I live in a big city). But still, even if you can't afford the test or a counselor or there isn't one available in your area, I think if you do the work you will find out a lot more about yourself than you ever thought.The reason for that is that the exercises don't have you focus on evaluating what YOU think your personal values and/or background are; but on practical, real-life exercises which end up surprising you with who you REALLY are deep down. I have to say that, in order to get the best possible experience from this book, you CaNNot just sit down and read it cover to cover. You HAVE to do the work and let it take it's time. Do not move onto another exercise/chapter until the previous one is complete. Otherwise you will be cheating yourself and the whole experience will turn into your perception of yourself as opposed to your real self. The 2 exercises I found the most helpful were 1) The shoebox you keep filled with cut-outs and post-its of things that interest you. Do not cheat on this exercise. Follow the instructions completely (it is a bit hard, but if you stay busy you won't have the time to over-analyze it). And 2) The family interviews. I had never felt much of a connection with any of my family members. When I was a kid I was absolutely convinced that I must have been adopted. But actually asking those questions (and recording them for later review) gave me SO many real insights into who my family REALLY is as opposed to my perceptions (read: assumptions) as to who they are. I have never felt closer to them then I do now.So, in summation, I have told you that I HATE self-help books, but here is my overall experience with the Highlands Ability Battery: I was 31 years old when I went down this path. My life sucked. I was college educated yet had chosen a career path which made me hate my life. I therefore quit my career, moved in with my parents, and managed a video store (assistant managed! I was managing whole firms when I was 26!) for over 2 and half years. I was disappointed with life and miserable. I had low self-esteem and felt like a failure and a loser. I thought had done everything right and \"followed all the rules\" (got good grades at a top high school, went to one of the top colleges in the country and graduated with a high GPA..). I thought that would mean my life was set up for automatic money and happiness. Boy was I wrong. Thank God for my career counselor who introduced me to this book and to the test. I am now more sublimely happy and optimistic about the future then I have ever been in my life. Don't get me wrong; it is a lot work but it's actually fun work getting to examine and know yourself. I have started over now in a new career path and am the top dog of all my other co-workers. I plan on starting my own company within the next year or two and already have a business plan and investors on board. I no longer wander aimlessly through life nor seek escapism (I used to spend most of my time at bars while awake, and the rest of my time was spent sleeping - 12-18 hours a day typically). For the first time in my WHOLE life I actually now wake up in the morning and am energized. I eat breakfast! (I've NEVER done that before) and I am in a committed relationship due to my boost in knowing who I am and what I can accomplish. Like I said, Do the work and you will be rewarded.Also, that previous reviewer's comments about corporations wanting the \"true-self\" you is the exact OPPOSITE of what they keep repeating in the book. The book tells you over and over again that a company does want the \"true self\" you because that interferes with their goals. I don't know how that person got that impression of this book (amongst other things...). I would ignore them.",

This book explores eight different areas, with thought exercises throughout, so the reader can be pointed in the right direction.Does the answer to a problem suddenly pop into your head, or are you more of a methodical, step-by-step type? Can you handle people coming to you with problems or questions on a non-stop basis, all day? Introvert or extrovert? Specialist or generalist? What is most important to you; family, health, excitement, spiritual fulfillment, etc? How much time per day do you spend doing what's most important to you? What sort of family did you grow up in? What sort of personal boundaries would you like to set up regarding your job (no more late nights, no more weekends, etc.)? What is your boss likely to accept?Many books are available attempting to help the reader find the sort of occupation that is best for them. This one belongs at, or near, the top of the list.

It is the first known book written by a coach/clinician that uses the latest brain research to teach four easily-learned strategies that can diminish the harmful effects of stress, increase a sense of personal control, engage and enhance a person's physical, emotional, spiritual and intellectual health, and are enjoyable and easy to do. Author Millie Grenough created the OASIS Strategies during her recovery from a near-death accident in the midst of her own high-velocity lifestyle. \"Suddenly, and for months,\" she says, \"I was thrust into a slow, surreal pace of living. I knew that I needed to find some strategies to get myself back to health?but not back to the fast lane.\" The OASIS Strategies helped to restore Millie to total health, and they have helped people from all walks of life find balance and enjoyment in day-to-day living. \"With four simple strategies to refresh your perceptions in an oasis of calm, Millie Grenough is offering nothing less than the opportunity and means to change your life?for the better.\" David L.

The author does not talk down to the reader but rather respect's your intelligence and individual experience. At the same time, she writes from a position of authority and backs up her findings and opinions with sound research. Throughout the book, I could almost hear the author's voice reading the words to me.I think the aspect of Oasis I liked the most is that it does not promise too much, but what it does promise, it delivers. What I mean is, the author is not claiming that these techniques will make you as athletic as a major league ball player, as good looking as a supermodel, or as smart as Einstein; but the techniques will make you a better person and feel like you have more control of your life.I have already practiced each of the book's four techniques and my wife has already noticed the difference. I am recommending Oasis to my Mother and Mother-in-law who both recently lost their husbands and are in search of the Oasis in the Overwhelm of their daily lives.

After using it for just a short time, I began to have a re-occurance of my depression symptoms. I have since stopped using the cream and am slowly returning to my normal self. When I did a net search on the side effects of too much progesterone I found many people with my same experience. This book is very one sided, and he does not talk much about the negative aspect of using the cream.Please consult with a physician before starting this stuff on your own, or at least be aware of the possible side effects so that you can stop the cream as soon as you see them.

Now, I am finally understanding how the numerous xeno-hormones and major stress are causing my premenapausal symptoms and I'm learning how to take better care of myself so that my body does NOT start this phase too early! It also talks about the difference between natural and synthetic hormones and how we are ALL exposed on a normal basis and how they build up. It was a little difficult at first with the medical jargon, but he continually reinforces and builds on his findings from his and others' research. It is AMAZING how little MY doctors know about this! You would think my OB/GYN would be well-versed in this area, but everything they gave me made my symptoms worse! So don't automatically assume that a doctor will hold all the answers to your health, you need to do your own research and be your own advocate! That way, you will at least be well-informed. On top of that, they simply wouldn't consider any natural remedies (anything that didn't require a perscription). I went and got some natural progesterone (this book tells you exactly what to look for) and within a week I could tell the difference. That and some life-style changes (less stress, better food) have made an enormous difference. Not only that, I just found out last week that I'm pregnant! If you are having problems in this area too, I highly recommend reading this book before you go to a fertility clinic!!",

There are incredible amounts of xenoestrogens in our environment, chemicals that act on our bodies like estrogen. These are found in most petroleum based products (mineral oil, plastics, etc) and have an effect on our bodies that is subtle, yet can grow to be quite disruptive to our lives, and even deadly in some cases. The tragic death of Dana Reeve, a non-smoker with lung cancer, has brought to the forefront the fact that, of nonsmokers with lung cancer, 80% are WOMEN (source: USA Today, March 8th, Life section). This article even says that this is likely due to an estrogen effect.Natural progesterone helps to keep hormones in balance in a woman's body. Synthetic progestin IS NOT THE SAME, does not work on the body in the same way, and should not be used for long periods of time. Why doesn't your doctor know about this? Because most of the information she/he gets is from the pharmaceutical companies. Pharma cannot patent a natural element like natural progesterone, so they can't make money off of it. Hence, they push the synthetic hormones which have proved to be detrimental to women's health.PLEASE read Dr. Lee's book, and share with the women that you love. It is critical to your and their lifelong health and well-being.If you have more questions or want to learn how you can get natural progesterone cremes, click on my name above to send me an email.",

Yes the book is bios about natural progesterone, so what... I have not personally used progesterone cream yet, because I am waiting for my saliva test results to make sure that's what I need. But even if I don't, everything else provided in the book is amazing information. Your diet, your vitamins, your stress level, your physical activity, everything is co-related to most woman's hormonal imbalances. They even talked about a case where a woman did not want to use the natural progesterone and how by changing all of the other stuff in her life, she achieved hormone balancing. If you are suffering from hormonal imbalances, I will strongly recommend this book. I also bought other ones that I will be reading after this one. But I started with \"Be Lean by Romy Seleznov\", which is a story from her life and how she struggled to balance her hormones and gives all the details of what she did, then I continued with this book, and the next one I will be reading is \"Natural Hormone Balance for Women\" by Uzzi Reiss, which does cite this book as well.If you think you have a hormonal imbalance, please do not rely on your doctor 100%, I am not saying that you should not believe them or rule out everything they say, but do your homework. I have been telling my doctors since I am in my TEENS that I feel I have an imbalance with my hormones and since all of the results come back fine they have been telling me that my symptoms were \"normal\"... WRONG!!! Now they found a tumor in my pituitary gland, which causes an imbalance... The tumor grows slowly, so I am sure that it has been there for years, but they never checked it before. Now that I am treating it, all of my \"normal\" symptoms are almost gone. I am still on the process of getting everything in balance. If you feel you have something wrong, even if the results of your blood work comes as normal, READ more and look for healthy ways of changing your diet, exercising more, balance your hormones, and look for second opinions and definitely have a good naturopath that you can go to. Also \"Bikram Yoga\", is an excellent exercise to helping you with hormonal balancing. At least that's part of what I changed.I hope this reviewed helped you and good luck finding what you are looking for!",

As a physician myself, I wholeheartedly agree with the authors' stance that these symptoms arising from a lack of balance in one's life cannot be solved by radical surgery and/or prescription hormones.The information about substances that we use every day which can disturb the delicate biochemical balance that makes us function at an optimal level, was very eye-opening, and even a little frightening. Most people are unaware of the hidden dangers in a seemingly innocuous bottle of nail polish and nail polish remover.The recommendations made are easily within the reach of any woman who is interested in embarking on the quest for balance. Although the use of the natural hormone progesterone is advocated, the authors state very clearly that this will only work in the long run if measures to achieve balance in other aspects of one's life (e.g. diet. stress management) are also implemented at the same time. It really is all about balance in all aspects of one's life.

It is clear and concise and incredibly informative. It assumes the reader wants to take responsibility for her own healthcare and wants to find a doctor to partner with that has the same assumption. It gives you the information and scientific evidence for putting your body into hormonal balance naturally and through a balanced diet supplemented by vitamins herbs and exercise and supplemental hormones.It does so without the bias of alleged scientific evidence backed by self interested pharmaceutical companies. He does not endorse any company or product but he was the pioneer in promoting progesterone cream as a means to hormonal balance and makes a strong case through his own practice in terms of the benefits of this approach. There has been some confusion by other reviewers of his book about what he is promoting so I want to clear that up.He does not promote bio-identical drugs which are those that are made by pharmaceutical companies and mimic natural ingredients and need to patented by pharmeceutical companies in order to be sold. He does promote the use of progesterone cream which is not a bio-identical as defined above. Dr Carolyn Dean who has written a few books on hormonal balance does a better job of explaining this in her books, Hormone Balance and Menopause Naturally.

Love of self is absolutely necessary before you can expect to love you as a person and this book goes into more depth of details and even includes a wonderful screening process on pages 76-80 where you can check off certain characteristics and make a list of those you desire in a boyfriend/mate. I also used it as a process to see what I see in myself as a woman and had my friends check off the qualities that they see in me and those I need to work on. That is something that Jennifer Bawden recommends you do in order to see what qualities we need to work on as a person in order to contribute to a relationship without being blinded by our faults. I could probably write here all day but I do want to say that I always go back for further reminders that I need to remember because sometimes (not always) we lose a sense of ourselves in our relationships because we have certain expectations....this book shows that you are responsible for the relationship and have a choice....never have expectations and you will always be pleasantly surprised....oh, and dont jump into a serious relationship first without taking it slow.

Such a person may have difficulty expressing true feelings because of the fear that others will react negatively towards them. They may be afraid that if they speak their truth, others will become angry and abandon them, criticize, judge, invalidate or send them on a guilt trip. As a result, the \"self\" or soul of this person may be imprisoned by dependency on others and the fear of how others may react. If this describes you, How to Grow a Second Skin for Your Soul may offer the help you need to emancipate your soul.

The truth is, this book can help you become more spiritual, and a much happier person, by helping you to build strong boundaries, a solid sense of self. Only when you have done so are you truly free to grow into the spiritual being you were meant to be. When you are comfortable within your own skin, you are in a much better place to relate to and be compassionate toward others. Realize this. This solid sense of self, once created, will become the vehicle for your growth to a new and higher level of consciousness. If you are someone who is constantly hurt by others, who worries what others think of you, who says &quot;yes&quot; when in your heart you are thinking &quot;no,&quot; get this book and begin moving off the deadend level you are stuck on.

Dr. Burgess knows her material well and teachers with a style that is both engaging and practical. Two particularly helpful `tools' were envisioning a \"semi-permeable\" bubble shield around you to keep out the \"bad\" while letting in the \"good\", as well as categorizing people into the \"no\", \"maybe\" and \"yes\" categories in order to discern the difference between malevolent and benevolent encounters (and in order to \"see energy clearly\"). The author offers verbal responses and tips for handling people you have categorized into the \"no\" and \"maybe\" categories as well as offering visualization and energetic techniques to help one stay centered when triggers and assaults occur. She guides you through the developmental process of growing through your fears to be able to speak the truth and become spiritually \"free\" from perceived oppressing energy, such as fear of judgment, criticism, guilt, abandonment and ostracism. And she guides you through the process of healing your heart in order to be able to trust and \"let in the good\" and to reach a space of neutrality, healthy self-esteem and inner peace. This is the first book to weave psychology with metaphysical principles and \"tools\", this approach really spoke to me and made sense. \"How To Grow A Second Skin For Your Soul\" will change your life in that it will make you emotionally centered, it will help you develop your core, your self-esteem, and your relationship with y our self and others.

This book \"solves\" so many questions people have about their lives so simply, so elegantly it left me wondering why it took \"the kind universe\" so long to help people understand how to get on the road to and build their own happiness.Let me attempt to explain: What's wrong with \"traditional\" self-help is there's no \"self\" in it. We read about other people's \"success patterns\". They sell us on why their \"patterns\" work best. Problem is they don't work for us precisely because they're other peoples'. This creates a nice self-help industry, but doesn't help readers become any happier--or even help them realize what does make them happy! Does this make sense?Newburg's genius is giving us a \"process\" for identifying, understanding, and incorporating into our lives what uniquely makes us happy. He has put the \"self\" back where it belongs, at the center of the process. Warning: he's also put the responsibility (and fun) for understanding and action back where it belongs, with us, not with Dr. Phil, Steven Covey, or Tony Robbins.I know why he had to publish this himself. It's the last \"self-help\" book-- the only \"self-help\" book you'll ever need. Why would an industry that exists because people are searching for \"themselves\" actually tell you how to find yourself? That's business suicide.Anyway, thank-you Dr. Newburg, thank-you.

Scott Peck, in the style of presenting profound insights into sensible, easy-to-understand language and clear ideas an average person can relate to. Practicing Licensed Professional Counselor and Nationally Certified Cognitive-Behavioral Therapist and author of \"Stepping Out Of The Bubble\", James Krehbiel proficiently shares a portion of his expertise, condensing great weight into accessible and workable solutions for a more fulfilling life's plan.The \"bubble\" represents our security and comfort zone, but it is also the inner place where we store the pain of our past experiences and the unpleasant reality of that not being made conscious which keeps us bound in unhealthy and self-defeating patterns. Staying within this bubble limits our emotional responsiveness as we numb ourselves to the coexistence even as unresolved issues unconsciously filter forth. To step outside of the bubble is to courageously examine the contents in all honesty and to face life's reality outside of the bubble. Once outside the bubble, one can move forward to experience life in more emotional depth, fullness and passion. \"Being a fully functioning individual is about being true to whom you are and letting things be the way they are,\" explains author, James Krehbiel.With brilliant and compassionate understanding, Mr. Krehbiel briefly details methods used and pertinent case examples within his therapy practice. \"Self-regulation is a goal of therapy. I educate people in the fact that all the answers are ultimately within.\" \"Stepping Out Of The Bubble\" strives to do the same, by giving information on how we become trapped in the bubble and how beneficial the making of conscious choices to leave, can be.Some of the many topics included within this book are: being assertive, characteristics of an \"authentic\" person, the integration of each of our different personality parts, the difference between true guilt and false guilt, setting boundaries, addictions and addictions to \"manic\" relationships, awareness (staying in the moment or mindfulness), grounding, honoring one's inner voice, panic attacks, OCD and mood disorders. The section regarding kids and parenting was exceptional, in my opinion, and I found many points about discipline that made much sense. Also appreciated was the section relating to religion (dogma) versus faith (spiritual) as well as what needed to be said about pop culture.I enjoyed reading \"Stepping Out Of The Bubble\" and would recommend it to anyone. It is enriching and inspirational.",

I found myself experiencing an emotional reaction to many of the case examples and concepts he explored. He definitely hit some \"hot buttons\" in my life. But Mr. Krehbiel also provided specific guidelines and tools for stepping out of the bubble. At one point he says, \"Courage can be defined by those who live outside the bubble as opposed to those who live in it. I like to compare stepping out of the bubble to wading into the water.\"His chapter which includes ideas on multidimensional thinking is appropriate in today's political climate. He indicates that true dialogue takes into consideration the appreciation for differences in opinions. He makes some profound statements about pop culture's affect on the lives of today's children. He also gives parents tools and resources for assisting their children in bettering their behavior.

        "description": "Do or Die is designed exclusively to help baby-boomer men restore health, vitality, happiness, and longevity through fitness, faith, and food. Do or Die explains how to get out of denial and discover the inspiration and willpower to create life-changing renewal and a healthy lifestyle. Do or Die reviews seven midlife chronic conditions that reduce life expectancy and life quality. Author Jim McFarland calls these \"pathways to middle-aged male destruction.\" Based on his personal experiences and years of extensive research, Do or Die offers numerous strategies and ideas for exercise, weight management, nutrition, and life balance. McFarland's advice will help you: Start defeating the vicious grip of denial Recognize how to rebuild your self-esteem Understand how to lose weight Learn how good nutrition and exercise will help lower your cholesterol and your risk of type two diabetes and heart disease Understand how to take responsibility for your health Learn how to avoid injuries when exercising Discover the importance of using a heart rate monitor for all fitness training Do or Die will guide you in writing a personal renewal plan, and it will also help you learn how to create and enjoy balance in your life. Take the first step towards better health today! With his health declining, McFarland took control and turned his life around. At 52, the author was what has become your Standard American Male-obese, sedentary, hypertensive and in deep denial-when his doctor reported that he was a prime candidate for type-two diabetes. The good news is that he decided to do something about it. In frank language, he discusses his renewal strategy and the routines and behaviors for rebuilding his physical and mental health, finding balance and peace in the process. First he had to own up to his rotten condition, his blubber and sloth, and become conversant with his body's cardiovascular needs, his metabolism, what comprises a healthy diet and his need for physical activity. Thus began his education in cholesterol, stress, midlife depression, the body mass index, blood analysis, high blood sugar and a host of other subjects-all of which he manages to convey in clarity and modest depth, despite his lack of professional training. He endeavored to use common sense in his eating and exercise, gradually creating a life script comprised of the seven Fs: Fitness (he provides a detailed, gradual program), Finding what is important in your life, having Faith in what you believe (discovering some spiritual support), eating the right Foods, time with Family, Friendships and having Fun. He consistently stresses the elemental need for self-respect; without it, he says, you won't have the will to embark on what amounts to a complete lifestyle change. A helpful if arduous map for living a better life that certainly beats the alternative: giving up and dying. -Kirkus Discoveries",

I searched and searched and could not find one text. Therefore, I started doing research to help me save myself. Then I started writing. I have learned that millions of baby-boomer men live in denial---afraid to admit to having health problems. This book will help older men get out of denial, face their problems squarely, and deal with them honestly. The book is loaded with techniques, ideas and strategies to help men take responsibility for their health and create new and healthy lifestyles. This book is all about renewal and prevention. Men need to act now to avoid costly and life-threatening bypass surgeries and other major medical procedures. The book is all about doing---figuring out ways to live longer and happier lives. I hope men everywhere who need help will read it and help themselves.",

The author tackles with candor and passion the three major health problems affecting older men-obesity, hypertension and type two diabetes. He prescribes a regimen of food, fitness and faith that can help men become healthier and happier individuals. McFarland states that nearly as many Americans die everyday from heart disease as died on 9/11. He says he was as much as 70 pounds overweight, had high blood sugar and didn't exercise much. Through faith, self-confidence and hard work, he turned his life around from being one of denial to one of doing. I believe his ideas for helping people get out of denial are unique, when compared to other self-help books. This book really is a step-by-step primer for male renewal. I think Do or Die can help men can change their behavior, take control of their health, and improve the quality of their lives.G.K. Graf, Seattle, WA",

Barbara Lawrence details the evolution of the individuals in this particular relationship and the dynamics of the relationship itself. Her chronicle reminds me of a Stephen King horror story where pretty normal people and situations begin, almost imperceptively, to go awry. By the time things have become completely warped and unacceptable to the observer, the participants themselves have bought into their lives through a combination of denial, rationalization and self doubt and are living in a way they think of as &quot;normal&quot;. Coming from a family with an alcoholic parent, I think it is courageous and important that the author shed light for all of us by sharing very personal information. All of us in situations similar to hers learn first and foremost to keep secrets. And keeping those secrets ultimately leads to our own emotional destruction. This story is sad and tragic for the author's whole family including the father. To me, the saddest part was when the author looked at photographs of her absent children and asked herself why she has photographs of those she loves instead of having them. As children, our inclination is to blame our parents for what is wrong in our lives. This book has helped me to better understand them, and in the case of the living, have hope for them. And ultimately, to forgive them. Only then can we begin to build healthy and happy lives for ourselves instead of becoming casualties of our upbringing. For this family, I hope that through telling the secrets and all that implies, they can each finally find personal happiness and a better life.",

There is nothings likable about Tom, and the reader isn't cheering for his recovery. He is obviously mentally ill and utterly self-involved from the very beginning, and why she doesn't recognize this is puzzling. So is the fact that she stays with this lunatic for *25 years*. She doesn't love him, she doesn't need him, he's ruining her life... but still she stays. She never confronts the fact that she's co-dependant, and it leaves with reader with the idea that she stuck around because living with a sick, twisted man made for fascinating material. I'm not convinced that his problem was anorexia -- he had obvious mental and social problems before he started starving himself, and I felt that the anorexia was simply another syndrome of whatever was wrong with him. That a bright, successful, wealthy woman would stay with someone like him and tolerate his gross, controlling behavior left me shaking my head. Why Barbara, why?",

The author gives scant lip service to her complicity in this family drama never quite owning up to her martyr-like co-dependency.

Her husband, Tom, is very ill indeed, and throughout the book I could not help but feel not only sorry for him, but anger at her. Her naivete and lack of compassion, I feel, contributed greatly to the escalation of his illness. I could not help but wonder if she would have been so ignorant if her husband had cancer or diabetes or a fatal brain tumor. Tom needed help desperately, and Ms. Lawrence chose instead to focus on her own needs during his troubled times. She shows an astounding ignorance in this day and age of the disease, of Raynaud's disease, which Tom claims he has, and of it's implications. Not surprisingly, her husband improves once she leaves him. Her selfishness seems unbounded. At Tom's very worst times is when she thinks of leaving him. There is no question her life was difficult living with this man, but there is also no question that Tom had a serious, life threatening, chemical imbalance that could have been helped a great deal with her support. I wonder what her purpose was in writing her memoirs. If it was to gain sympathy for her ordeal, she should think again. I admire Tom much more, and wish him a life with someone who will make an attempt to understand and secure help for him when he needs it. In all fairness I could not base my rating on how I feel about the subject matter. Others may feel very differently. So I gave the book four stars for the very fact that it IS thought provoking and well written. I just hope that Ms. Lawrence does not applaud herself too much.",

Other readers may be incredulous watching as her husband \"Tom\" deteriorates, withering from a robust athlete to a dry husk of a man, a man so consumed by his illness that he can hardly relate to anything in the world around him. But we know that is the power and tragedy of eating disorders. Bitter Ice is a beautiful and brave book that describes a slow descent into hell from which Lawrence retrieves herself with the help of her friends and family. Bitter Ice shows us the complexity of relationships patterned by culture and colored by context, but still the responsibility of each of us as individuals. And finally, Bitter Ice shows us that eating disorders are NOT \"for women only.\" Over a million men suffer from ED in this country alone, and 40% of college students with bulimia are men. Still, too many people still think, as Tom's psychiatrist did, \"Oh, men can't be anorexic, that's a woman's disease.\" This is a book for anyone who has ever been affected by obsessive or co-dependent behavior, or by anyone who cares about.

She continues her tale describing life as partner to an increasingly ill man and her private process of recognizing and finding a response to her horrible circumstances. Second, within this very personal story I found exraordinary information. There is rich descrption of anorexia in adult men and the diffculties identifying it; there is Barbara's description of what she had to tackle in order to understand what was happening to her husband; there is eqully rich description of the impact of anorexia on immediate family and those further removed. Finally, readers should know that this is a very beautifully crafted book. The story is carefully told, the writing is clear.

The warning signs of how unhealthy Tom was were clearly evident before they were married, I had to wonder what she was thinking going through with the wedding. As his behavior deteriorated over the years, I could not believe how she sat on her hands and allowed him to treat her that way with the 'poor me' attitude, instead of getting him some help - by ultimatum if necessary. Every new life event - children, moving, new jobs, etc. she hopes will change him and make him happy and well. This never happens, and one wonders why she fails to see the pattern (or why she chooses so hard to ignore it?) The author blames her mother and upbringing for her lack of personal strength and confidence, but she seemed perfectly capable and driven when it came to her career and schooling. I found it hard to be sympathetic to her plight when she so contributed to being a doormat. The book is a very interesting read and I did enjoy it, but when she finally leaves him at the end (as you know she will) all I can think is &quot;Good riddance and what the heck took you so long?&quot;",

Or maybe the problem isn't your nutty co-worker or boss. Did you ever stop tothink that you might just be your own worst enemy at work by dint of your irritating quirks?Whatever your work situation, this book has with not only the symptoms but also the cure for what ails you. The authors use questionnaires, anecdotes, and specific scenarios to come up with solutions to various work situations.Katherine Crowley, a Harvard-trained psychotherapist, and Kathi Elster, a small business expert, combined their expertise in this book.Each chapter describes the problem behavior, how you might beexacerbating the problem, and actions you can take to change yourreaction to the behavior and thereby create a different result. Theauthors believe that the one factor having the most impact on a satisfying work environment is being able to master your state of mind, and after reading this book, I agree.They describe emotional \"hooks\" and delineate steps you can take to \"unhook\" yourself, along with setting boundaries at work.They describe the \"Fatal Attractions,\" who suck you into their webs: the exploder, the empty pit, saboteur, pedestal smasher, and the chip-on-the-shoulder, all of whom make life miserable.But managers also have their own crosses to bear in the form of parenting their recalcitrant charges, the employees, a.k.a. the chronically delayed, MIA, cynics, passive-aggressives,attention-seekers, bad attitudes, slugs, addicts, and the thief.The authors' contention that...\"If you can change your reaction,you'll change your life\" resonated with me--not only in terms of my job, but also my life--and this book illuminated this for me.Armchair Interviews says: If you don't have someone at work who drives you a little batty, you must work alone.

Putting a form of scientific method to resolving work related problems - including the reader's assessment of their own role in the problem - is a big part of the text. It provides an organized and controllable process to attempt issue resolution.For me, the best part of the book, however, was the subject of \"Managing Up,\" in which the authors urge their readers to take more control over their disappointing managers by using that same scientific method to manage them to preferred solutions. Good advice.And, there are a number of self-help exercises to assess your fit with Corporate Culture, or to determine if you are hooked (emotionally distressed) by a \"Fatal Attraction\"-type manager etc. Again - good stuff and helpful to think about for many people, particularly the less experience workforce.Still, I was caught in a bit of a dilemma. The book is written from the point of view of what do you do when someone else is causing emotional discomfort to you - as if you are the center of the universe. OK - that's why you bought the book. But, survey results from reputable researchers show that the primary reason for people remaining with their jobs is that they like their co-workers. Even more than their commitment to the work they do, they begin with liking their co-workers. Therefore, a collegial environment is critical to employee retention, customer satisfaction and business performance. This clearly suggests that there is a corresponding responsibility for each worker to fit in with their colleagues - even if minor personality traits or managerial quirks exist, and they always do.The workplace isn't typically about achieving personalized justice, as much as it is about intelligent people grouping together to form an efficiently running and productive organization. Readers should not lose focus of this. Otherwise - \"You\" may be the person referenced as killing the climate (and your co-workers) in your quest to untrap yourself of the personal demons that ruin your day.Overall, a good book, and a solid reference to have handy.",

Upon further thought though, the appeal of this book for me has less to do with wireless and more to do with the variety of different personalities I've encountered in my professional life - regardless of the industry.A lot of books offer advice on how to deal with difficult people - particularly in personal relationships. This book takes a turn at helping people learn to cope with the personalities they have to deal with at work. Katherine Crowley is a psychotherapist and Kathi Elster is a small business expert; together they describe themselves as \"undercover business therapists.\" While their focus on professional relationships is new, their message is familiar - \"you can't change other people's behavior, but you can change your reaction to it.\"Unhooking is the KeyThe authors explain that changing your reaction starts with finding ways to \"unhook\" yourself from the situation, and they give specific examples of ways to tell - both physically and emotionally - whether you are 'hooked\". Symptoms include headaches and fatigue, anger, depression and forgetfulness. Their \"Four Pronged Unhooking Technique\" is simple and is good, practical advice for anyone dealing with difficult people at work.Not all TheoryWhile a lot of books give you theories on dealing with others, \"Working With You is Killing Me\" gives tips and examples on how to use the technique in real life business situations. And they don't assume it's only co-workers who drive you nuts: tips for obnoxious bosses are also presented.Managing Up, Down and SidewaysCrowley and Elster not only deal with how to work with a difficult boss (Managing Up), their term for managing a team of people, or \"Managing Down\" - \"Business Parenting\" hits the mark perfectly (take it from someone who has managed large teams of people -- I could completely relate to their analogy of \"problem children\" as I read this section).I also found the quiz that the authors present to help readers determine if their job is a good fit to be very helpful. Every company has its own culture and personality type that excels within that culture. This quiz is an effective tool to help you determine if the company or job you are in is the right one for you.Considering the amount of stress workplace disharmony causes - on everyone involved - this is an important book. I found it easy-to-read with simple, practical steps that can be easily implemented in real life. I highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling with a co-worker, boss or subordinate at work!",

                "review/text": "This book delivers.In my experience, 99% of the books on professional relationships out there fall into either of two categories:Most of them refuse to address - some even to accept - that a few people you encounter in the corporate world have pathological dysfunctions. These books dedicate all of their content to treat your inability to cope with differences between people's personalities and yours. \"Change the way you react to other people and all your problems will vanish\" is the axiom behind the pages, from cover to cover, in these texts.Books in the second category, on the other hand, are usually written by mental health professionals and do address the presence of people with personality disorders in the working environment. Their recommendation is simple: just leave the place, as fast as you can. They paint a scary picture of the sociopath or borderline personality next door, and advise a bee line to the door, specially if next is a manager's door.Problem is the landscape of the average corporation is a hodgepodge of dysfunctions and interpersonal mistakes - from the minor ones we all incur, to the full-fledged, unchecked, sociopathy. To further complicate things, it is becoming increasingly clear that, not only most personality disorders are actually co-dependency phenomena - i.e. \"victim\" and perpetrator are both entangled in a reinforcing relationship - but there is also a social component in the prevalence of dysfunctional leaders. Simply put, some cultures (be it a country or the firm you might work for) select and empower dysfunctional leaders.Navigating far away from these considerations, Crowley and Elster's book very definitely assume there are all kinds of people and situations in a typical firm - as well as among the READERS of their book! We, readers, can find ourselves sometimes incurring in the infamous \"fundamental attribution error\" (assuming the person we are dealing with is moved by ill intention), some other times we may just lack one or two emotional skills, to deal with a not-that-complicated conflict. But - and in that \"but\" resides the uniqueness of \"Working With You is Killing Me\" - there are also occasions in which we are entangled in a dysfunctional relationship with someone with a personality problem.Without explicitly labeling the \"other part\" as a dysfunctional person - what good would that do? - the authors do label the RELATIONSHIP as dysfunctional and address all the sides of the matter: the role the reader possibly has in it, the futility of expecting changes from the other person, and what can objectively be done to change the situation, without necessarily jumping out of the boat (just to run into another dysfunctional top dog, in the next job).Another great source of value in \"Working With You is Killing Me\" are the abundant textual examples of how to phrase the messages the authors recommend, as well as how to prepare to deliver them. As the authors of \"Influencer\" emphatically remark, it is essential to have vicarious experiences - seeing how others handle difficult tasks - for us to learn that skill. Crowley and Elster's textual examples of speeches provide just that.On the other hand, if something might be criticized in \"Working With You is Killing Me\", is the somewhat harsher-than-necessary tone of some of these examples. Though nobody could possibly be called aggressive, by spelling them, in my experience (and, I believe, in some authors' as well) their too impersonal undertone would probably create a barrier to a good leadership rapport. Che Guevara's words - \"hay que endurecer-se pero sin perder la ternura\" (one has to grow hard, but without losing the tenderness) - apply here.That said, \"Working With You is Killing Me\" is a unique, must-read book, for anyone interested in on-the-job relationships, which, I suspect, probably includes all of us.",

        "description": "Statistics suggests that as many as 2.5 percent of American women suffer from anorexia; of these, further research indicates that one in ten of these will die from the disorder. This is the only book available that addresses the particular needs of anorexics with the techniques of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), a revolutionary new psychotherapy. The authors of this book are pioneering researchers in the field of ACT, with numerous research articles to their credit Despite ever-widening media attention and public awareness of the problem, American women continue to suffer from anorexia nervosa in greater numbers than ever before. This severe psychophysiological condition-characterized by an abnormal fear of becoming obese, a persistent unwillingness to eat, and severe compulsion to lose weight-is particularly difficult to treat, often because the victims are unwilling to seek help. The Anorexia Workbook demonstrates that efforts to control and stop anorexia may do more harm than good. Instead of focusing efforts on judging impulses associated with the disorder as 'bad' or 'negative,' this approach encourages sufferers to mindfully observe these feelings without reacting to them in a self-destructive way. Guided by this more compassionate, more receptive frame of mind, the book coaches you to employ various acceptance-based coping strategies. Structured in a logical, step-by-step progression of exercises, the workbook first focuses on providing you with a new understanding of anorexia and the ways you might have already tried to control the problem. Then the book progresses through techniques that teach how to use mindfulness to deal with out-of-control thoughts and feelings, how to identify choices that lead to better heath and quality of life, and how to redirect the energy formerly spent on weight loss into actions that will heal the body and mind. Although this book is written specifically as self-help for anorexia sufferers, it includes a clear and informative chapter on when you need to seek professional treatment as well as advice on what to look for in a therapist.",

However, after becoming involved with one he dedicated himself to studying the problem and with the help of several addiction experts has produced this fascinating book. One of the problems with alcoholism is that it has a tendency to not be diagnosed until it is too late and the person has ruined their health and their life. Doug takes the view that by recognizing the behavioral clues we can find the hidden alcoholic while there is still time to prevent tragedy.The book is divided into three distinct parts. First is a section that redefines alcoholism so that earlier diagnosis and prevention is possible. The second section is a detailed examination of the various clues that point to early-stage alcoholism. The last section discusses middle-stage clues and clues of multiple drug use.Many of the behavior items listed and detailed are indicative of addictive behavior in general and not necessarily just alcoholism. The primary value in this book is that it is the first one I have seen that is designed for the general public and focuses on the early signs of alcoholism. In fact, many of the professional level books do not deal with recognizing alcoholism at this early stage. &quot;How to Spot Hidden Alcoholics&quot; should be required reading for everyone and especially so for those who deal with counseling others whether in a professional, volunteer, or pastoral capacity.",

When I read the book, I was amazed, at first at how consistent many of Thorburn's insights were to my experience, and then at how it helped me see my own history of alcoholism. I have 4+ years sober and attend AA regularly. This book helped me see my old behavior from a new vantage point. I gained a new level of clarity of my own defects (Step 4) and it help me articulate many amends (Step 9) in a practical context.I understand the concern about credentials, but it doesn't really bother me. In my experience, and in talking with hundreds of recovered alcoholics, we were experts at hiding our addiction from the credentialed professionals. I wish more in the healthcare profession would read and at least consider Thorburn's points.I think Thorburn's point is that, since alcoholism is a progressive disease, and since the alcoholic tends to have increasing destructive behaviors, it is simple common sense to be on the lookout for traits of early alcoholics---not to condemn the drinker, but to protect one's self-interest.More importantly, if we can identify alcoholics earlier, we can take off our own blinders to their destructive behaviors, and stop enabling them. I, like most alcoholics, needed to hit bottom. I have learned that while we should not deprive an alcoholic of their bottom, if possible, we should try to raise their bottom, leading to an earlier and more likely successful recovery.This book, and Thorburn's Myths and Realities, is an excellent synthesis of ideas. He has kinda \"reverse-engineered\" the disease and helped me see this progressive, destructive, and fatal disease from a better vantage point. From what I have learned in this book, I have been better at talking to people sooner about their drinking, planting the seeds of recovery, so that if/when they experience consequences of their drinking, they can face the question of whether they have developed this disease.The beauty of alcoholism for me, as a recovered alcoholic, is that I have a peace and serenity that no expert could have provided...By the way, the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous were experts with NO credentials except observation and experience. I and millions of others are thankful for these non-experts who spoke up.WARNING--this book may be threatening to some active alcoholics rationalizing their addiction.Arthur M.

The substance abuse is a large symptom of a hugely complex emotional and personality disorder. If all it took was an arm x-ray to prove and treat, the disease would be gone.It's an unfortunate truth that addicts such as myself haveabused the ones who loved us the most. You people don't speak our language, know our secret signs and signals. I make it sound like a undercover brotherhood, and in a way it is. Whydo you think AA is so successful?

Thorburn correctly puts all the pieces of the puzzle together. If you think you might need this book, you do. Get it and protect yourself.",

                "review/text": "Have you ever been in a relationship (business or personal) where the other person's behavior seems baffling? This book untangles and demystifies many of the behaviors which are conventionally explained through contrived, pseudo-psychological myths.Generally, if someone is determined to deceive you, he/she will succeed; however, there are some things he/she doesn't bother to hide because he/she is not even aware of them.In one instance, I avoided what would have been a disastrous business partnership. Another highly reputable lawyer in my field approached me about merging practices. In fact, I was flattered at the idea of affiliating with someone of his ability, talent and reputation. On the surface everything appeared excellent; I dismissed some of his odd behaviors as the eccentricities of genius. Fortunately, I had read this book and his \"eccentricities\" became perfectly clear. Within a year of my pulling out of the deal, his life started falling apart because of his inability to manage it (although, it still looked fine on the surface). I now know that he drinks in the morning, has seven scotch lunches and carries an extra suitcase on trips exclusively for liquor.Similarly, I avoided a personal relationship headed for tragedy. At first I didn't suspect that this seemingly well-put-together, ambitious workout fanatic had a drinking/drug problem. Just like the story above, she did.If you are confounded by someone's behavior, check-out this book. It is well-worth the time and money.",

For a lay person as myself I was having a difficult time recognizing alcoholism with 2 people in my life. My sister and my significant other. These books taught me about this disease that was affecting my life and the life of my loved ones. Having no experience with alcoholism and what truly constitutes it or not. Hidden Alcoholics opened my eyes. I found myself repeatedly saying; \"yes, that is what was happening\". Before I read them I was both in denial about the situation and actually an enabler. After reading them I was empowered to confront the situation in my life and combat it with intelligent knowledge. I highly recommend this book, and Doug's others for everyone who needs his experience and knowledge to educate themselves.",

                "review/text": "Doug Thorburn provides vital information for all of us, in this eye-opening, fascinating book.It is the book I wish I'd had years ago when I was dealing with alcoholism, and didn't even know it. It might have saved me years of anguish, mental, emotional, and physical illness, and the loss of thousands upon thousands of dollars.As we live in a drinking culture, everyone can greatly benefit from the knowledge Thorburn provides. In the introduction (p.1) he notes that one of the surprising things about alcoholism is how little experts know, even today. The definition they have agreed upon fails to describe the affliction in its early stages.Some important points are:1). The current practice of identifying alcoholism is comparable to waiting till tumors become the size of basketballs before diagnosing cancer.2). Almost every alcoholic shows signs of the disease years or even decades before it progresses into latter-stage alcoholism, when chances for recovery are reduced.3). Alcoholics are, usually, intrinsically decent people.4). The earlier in the career of the alcoholic that private or legal sanctions are applied, the greater the chance of a return to normalcy.5). Becoming clean and sober requires the imposition of responsibility and appropriate consequences.The effects of alcoholism are mind-boggling. One alcoholism authority (p.88) estimates that 50% to 70% of all divorces involve alcoholism. The divorces are, in part, due to the alcoholic's propensity to create financial problems, as well as engage in domestic violence as well as non-physical abuse.They are also often caused by the great tendency in addicts to commit adultery. Caroline Knapp (p.90) points out that \"anonymous sex gives the illusion of intimacy with none of the attendant risks, none of the aching vulnerability of sober sex\".These are just some of the hard truths that Thorburn relates. You will learn about the many early stage clues that will help alert you to the problem. There are many ways to protect yourself and help the addict too.Thorburn is to be commended for educating us about this horrendous illness that continues to detrimentally affect millions upon millions of lives. Unfortunately, it is a subject that is rarely taught in schools. Even physicians are highly uneducated about it.Alcoholism breaks hearts, wounds spirits, and kills. It is a scourge upon this earth, and we all need to wake up and become educated on the disease. Learn all you can from this expert; a man who once loved an alcoholic, and suffered the consequences. His passion for the subject is a gift to us all. Take advantage of what he has to offer. You'll be glad you did. Very highly recommended!",

It's the tip of the whole rotten enchilada of neurosis! It's like an iceberg! 95 percent of our oedipal issues are submerged in or subconscious, waiting to be resolved. Then a person we want to be intimate with comes along just like the Titanic and slams into the frozen mass below the surface and we realize, hopefully, just how big and solid that iceberg really was. I also really liked the parts about the nature of fate. It seems like a strange subject to be in a psychology book but Dr. Lowen has bravely approached how we end up manifesting our subconscious drives over and over again for better or worse, and how we can use the awareness for better instead of worse. It's that pesky repitition compulsion again!Small case studies are integrated into the book and it progresses on explaing the nature and depth of the oedipal problem. It is never boring and not so technical that it is difficult to read. On the contrary, it is warm and conversational, but fully reveals the gravity and seriousness of resolving these issues so the we may experience love, pleasure and pain with the full response of our bodies and cooperation of the ego.

It does indeed strongly endorse and make vivid Freud's idea of the Oedipal Complex, but it is much more than just a reworking of Freud. Lowen brought enormous powers of observation and decades of clinical experience to the task of defining what happens in human development that leads to emotional limitations and suffering.For non-therapists,Joy: The Surrender to the Body and to Life (Compass)might be a better book to start with (fewer psychoanalytic concepts), but this is Lowen's most powerful book.",

The book pragmatically examines what emotional intelligence is all about and what it can achieve for individuals and organisations.

The book examines all the relevant issues and provides sound, sensible advice succinctly.The book will change the way you look at life and relate with people. This is particularly the case with people with professional backgrounds that tend to emphasise logic and rationality such as engineers, doctors, mathematicians and the like. It is critical to realise that emotional issues affect the way you work, your motivation, satisfaction and productivity and affect the quality of relationships among spouses or friends. Understanding and embracing EI can make you much happier and more effective as a manager and therefore I recommend this book strongly to anyone who wants to live a happier and successful life.",
