        "description": "Of all the lasting innovations that William Wordsworth (1770-1850) brought to our literature, it is his discovery of nature and his fresh vision of human lives in the context of nature that have most influenced our cultural climate. Here, collected in this volume, are Wordsworth's finest works, some of the most beautiful poems ever written: from the famous lyrical ballads, including \"The Tables Turned\" and \"Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey,\" to the sonnets and narrative poems, to excerpts from his magnum opus, The Preludes. By turning away from mythological subjects and artificial diction toward the life and language around him, Wordsworth acquired for poetry the strength and new sources of inspiration that have allowed it to survive and flourish in the modern world.",

Even the best volumes of verse have their flaws and while Rosal sometimes sacrifices the polished line, he consistently strives for a rawness of emotion and an energetic pulse in every stanza.

No one can claim this Pinoy is a wanna-b-boy.

He is a wordsmith with flava. An Adidas-clad artist who paints unimaginable depths of color and emotion with gut-wrenching histories and haunting phantasms. A sculptor who melds himself and Jersey grit into the clay, into the very essence that becomes the texture and substance of his art.This first collection of Rosal is not only a good study in the trajectory of second generation Pinoys, urban art, and hip hop poetics, but also the marking of a brilliant upcoming writer to watch.",

As Matthew Arnold notes, \"[Wordsworth's poetry] is great because of the extraordinary power with which [he] feels the joy offered to us in nature, the joy offered to us in the simple elementary affections and duties.\"",

The style is fragmented, wonderfully epigramatic, and is in a dozen or so different voices, some of them plain-spoken, some learned, some holy, many pushing the limits of sanity. The \"notes\" in the bottle don't come from one source, but seem to be drawn from countless forgotten sources. Codexes, conquest narratives, treatices on alchemy and the occult, the private thoughts of the long forgotten.I have no idea how much is invention and how much the fruit of research, but it doesn't matter. The effect of his style is like being lowered into a cavern of glittering artifacts; although rather than precious metal, these shards are made up of emotional and intellectual gold.One of my favorite, repeated (chanted?) phrases in the book has become a kind of motto for me -- almost impossible to live up to, but great to attempt: \"Pass by that which you do not love.\"When I work up the nerve, I'll get it tattooed on my arm. In the meantime, it's tattooed on my mind ... as is the rest of this amazing work.",

For once I disagree with Vendler's estimation of his poetic merits and craft. I would recommend Jeffers to a reader in the same spirit that Hass, C. Milosz, Wm. Everson, and Bukowski recommended that we listen to his prophetic voice. Jeffers's work embodies the Carmel landscape and cosmic essence of Northern California. Yet his voice is universal and resounds with tragic wisdom.I also recommend Hass, Milosz, Everson, H. Miller, and the academic treatments of Jeffers's work by Robert Brophy.",

                "review/text": "Actor. Musician. Photographer. And, last and perhaps most intriguingly, poet. Viggo Mortensen wears plenty of different hats as an artist. \"Coincidence of Memory\" collects assorted poetry, paintings and photographs ranging from the late 1970s to 2002. Whenever they are from and whatever they are, his creations are vivid and very striking.In both his visual and literary art, Mortensen shows a sort of evocative simplicity. His poetry can bring to mind very powerful emotions that are left up to us to imagine (\"Tried to say something/that filled my mouth/and longed to rest/in your ear/Don't dare write/it down for fear it'll/become words, just/words...\"). He can also bring to mind simpler, more everyday things like arguments, frozen roads and observing the changes in nature.His photography has the delicacy of a painting, with skilful use of light and color -- and the paintings are even better. For example, one is a simple shot of a mossy tree trunk surrounded by dry grass; another is of a leafless tree reflected in a car hood, and yet another is a darkly-lit picture of some little plants on the ground. Most striking is a photograph of electrical cables \"intruding\" on a grassy spot.There's an intimate, capture-the-moment feel to Mortensen's photographs, as if you can see these things through his eyes for a moment. The paintings are just as good, such as \"Self-Portrait, April\". It's a picture of Mortensen's lips and chin, with all other featured obscured by a collage-like swirl of hazy artwork. The paintings are definitely absorbing, even if you don't understand the story behind them.Viggo Mortensen's evocative, thoughtful artwork is shown in three different forms -- poetry, photographs and paintings -- in the beautiful \"Coincidence of Memory.\" A haunting, remarkable collection of Mortensen's work.",

I wanted to get inside Viggo and see things from his perspective, which he does allow.I was a little surprised by his poetry. It is not composed of rhyme or alliteration. It is often off-the-wall topics. My favorite is Keepsake about a letter opener. The poems are philosophical and definitely not ordinary. Other favorites are Communion-about a relationship and Edit-how one's work is reduced to a movie with the theater its grave.He likes to catch subjects in motion in photographs. Often they are blurred or have light coming in them as if someone opened up the door to the darkroom. They are skillful and interesting.His paintings (which are abstract) are surprisingly good. The blending of colors is beautiful.Viggo is definitely not just an actor; he is an artist in every sense.",

It is a book that can be displayed and shared with friends or picked up in the need of some tranquil and thought provoking times. By reading the poems, verses and viewing the images created both through photography and paintings with much diversified mediums and imagery you are taken on a journey of creativity. The cover of the book drew me to it, as it brought me back to my own childhood when my parents used to take me to \"El Retiro\" a beautiful park in Madrid, Spain. The picture captured those feelings of peace and happiness of long ago and brought them to the present. That interpretation is what art photography is about, capturing an image in the physical and transferring it to feelings of the heart. Viggo exemplifies so many creative people's dreams and goals that you can be successful in doing a multitude of endeavors. He serves as a mentor to the creative mind and this book typifies that conviction. It is clear from immersing one self in this book that the author has acquired much wisdom, knowledge and deep seated feelings through travel and being exposed to different cultures at a young age. If this book is representative of his other literary works I for one will definitely be awaiting their many arrivals into my observer's view.",

                "review/text": "I was totally ignorant of Wallace Stevens until I came to Yale and took Professor Harold Bloom's course \"How to Read a Poem.\" American poetry, as I, a Chinese student of a non-English major, understood it, is Walt Whitman, T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. In contrast, Wallace Stevens's name was strange to most Chinese intellectuals till recently. Even in his native country his rise to a canonical status was not immediate. Eliot's The Waste Land and Stevens' Harmonium debuted around the same time, but the former took all the spotlight. A mysterious \"X\" recurs in some of Stevens's letters and poems. This \"X\" refers to no other than Eliot, which may reflect a degree of frustration on the part of Stevens. Not until his late years did Stevens slowly but surely receive the recognition he deserved. A lagging effect in cross-lingual translation and interpretation may explain Stevens's relative invisibility to the Chinese audience. In addition, Stevens, especially in his later years, was highly meditative and philosophical, at times difficult and obscure, which also affected his accessibility to foreign readers.Professor Bloom's class first initiated me into the force and beauty of Stevens's poetry. What intrigues me is that Stevens lived a double life. He was an insurance lawyer in profession and a poet in private, and seemed to have no difficulty alternating between the two seemingly incompatible roles. Just like his work is so original that they defy any easy label, Stevens's life is so eccentric that he contradicts the stereotype of what a poet is supposed to be like. This is particularly astonishing in the eyes of the Chinese, for in our tradition commerce and poetry have very little in common. Chinese poets are easily associated with scholars, officials, hermits, monks, artists, but it is hard to think of any example of successful poet-businessmen.I especially love \"The Poems of Our Climate,\" a short piece written in 1938, when the poet was 59 years old. It was a number of years on from \"The Idea of Order in the Key West.\" For Stevens, it was a central poem. Stevens's poetic odyssey spanning over half a century was punctuated by two puzzling breaks: in 1898-1900, Stevens, a Harvard student poet, contributed regularly to Harvard Advocate. After he left Cambridge for New York, his poetry writing stopped short. After a complete silence of seven years when Stevens was struggling with his business career, in 1907 he began to present love songs to his muse Elsie Moll, and his creative faculty seemed to return. In 1923, Stevens, at the age of 44, finally published his first volume of poems, Harmonium. The book's poor reception and its author's growing domestic and corporate responsibilities almost led him to abandon poetry again. For four years Stevens published little. Not until 1929 did Stevens resume poetry writing. Like the Irish poet W.B.Yeats and the Chinese poet Du Fu, the bulk of Stevens's best work was not done until his late years. Interestingly, these three literary lions unanimously fall in love with the fall season: Yeats admires the trees in their autumn beauty in \"The Wild Swans at Coole\"; Du Fu composed a cycle of regulated poems under the general title of \"Autumn Meditations\"; Stevens' last major poetic endeavor is no other than \"The Auroras of Autumn.\" These pieces actually reflect the poets' \"autumnal personality.\" As they are approaching that season of their life, their works become increasingly sophisticated, retrospective and sublime. The following lines from John Keats' \"Ode to Autumn\" might be particularly pertinent to their situations:Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,\"The Poems of Our Climate\" was written in this \"autumnal period\" of the poet's life, thus belonging to the poetry of maturity. It is in three numbered sections. There is a break between each of the sections.IClear water in a brilliant bowl,Pink and white carnations. The lightIn the room more like a snowy air,Reflecting snow. A newly-fallen snowAt the end of winter when afternoons return.Pink and white carnations - one desiresSo much more than that. The day itselfIs simplified: a bowl of white,Cold, a cold porcelain, low and round,With nothing more than the carnations there.Stevens's difficulty often lies in referentiality. The first section seems to have nothing to do with the title. There is no direct reference whatsoever to either \"poems\" or \"our climate.\" Ostensibly the poet-persona is watching a Japanese flower arrangement. Stevens had a passion for oriental arts and philosophies. He was a close reader of Okakura Kakuzo (1862-1913), and his library was full of all kinds of books about Japanese flower arrangement. He was not only deeply read in this subject, but also had a habit of ordering fresh flowers from shops. The opening sentence introduces the image of flower arrangement by creating a pleasing word picture of balance, harmony and form. \"Clear water\" seems to be redundant, yet this rhetorical excess emphasizes the crystalline transparency of water. \"Brilliant\" etymologically means \"to emit light, to reflect light,\" thus accentuating the shiny surface of the container. The combination of \"pink and white carnations\" brings a festival of inviting colors and textures that are traditionally associated with feminine innocence, charm and gentility. The origin of the word \"carnation\" in Latin confirms the connection between the flower and human flesh. Behind this image of sexual provocation is a male observer's voyeuristic and fetishistic desire. The first sentence sketches the key components of a flower arrangement (through three nouns: water, bowl and carnations), with an emphasis on their optical and chromatic effects in the eyes of a spectator (through four adjectives: clear, brilliant, pink and white), and thus anticipates the \"light\" in the following sentence. \"[...]. The light / in the room more like a snowy air, / Reflecting snow\" embraces and extends the aura around the flower arrangement: the interior light is not like snow falling, but rather like air reflecting fallen snow. The observer is so subtle that he cannot help but elaborating the snow image: during the winter the afternoons have been very brief; but now, with afternoons elongating, winter is near the end and somehow meets early spring, and a fresh snow lies immaculate on the ground, like a breathtaking artwork of Nature, which gives a pure, refreshing and ethereal tone to the air reflecting snow. This late-winter scene suggests that the observer, like \"the snowman,\" wants \"a mind of winter,\" but not a mind of deep winter. The light that gives luster to the flower arrangement, like the rainwater that glazes a red wheelbarrow (William Carlos Williams, \"A Red Wheelbarrow\"), works beautifully on both formal and metaphorical levels. It represents a natural light, but as part of an art world it also becomes an aesthetic light.So far the language is very pictorial, in the manner of a still life. When Stevens portrays an object, he often builds a simple yet powerful image, omitting all insignificant details. Therefore, his image is at once concrete and abstract, familiar and unfamiliar, and appropriately distances itself from reality. In the first stanza of \"The Poems of Our Climate,\" the image is very concrete and real: this is about a Japanese flower arrangement. Meanwhile, there is no extravagant description of the object, but a word picture almost in the style of a Chinese xieyi (\"to convey the spirit\") painting. It highlights the principal components of the flower arrangement (water, bowl and carnations), and throws away lesser details (such as the spatial disposition of flowers, the effect of foliage). The aesthetic atmosphere is not only created by the description of the object itself; it is also a product of the language. To use minimalism to achieve maximal effect - this is also the case for the language. The diction is basic English words, mostly monosyllabic and disyllabic. Stevens only suggests and expects the reader to complete the picture by himself.\"Pink and white carnations\" recurs verbatim in line 6, implying that the observer moves his meditative eyes back to the core image. Then the poem abruptly takes another direction: \"One desires / so much more than that.\" This jump from imagistic to argumentative language is visually strengthened with the use of a hyphen to connect a noun phrase and a full sentence. Meanwhile, \"desire\" corresponds to the etymological hint of carnation, and the whole question about desire will continue to inform the rest of the poem. \"The day\" is in opposition to whatever \"in the room,\" designating the world external to the flower arrangement. Thus \"[...] The day itself / is simplified\" suggests that art reduces the outside world. \"[...] a bowl of white, / Cold, a cold porcelain, low and round, / With nothing more than the carnations there.\" Once again, Stevens returns to visual imagery, but this is not a wanton repetition of the earlier lines, but rather a repetition with nuanced variations or a deliberate revision, as if the observer observes through a closer perspective. \"Cold, a cold porcelain, low and round\" introduces new details about the container and unmistakably echoes the \"cold pastoral\" in Keats's \"Ode on a Grecian Urn.\" While \"a bowl of white\" seems a neutral description of what is seen, the \"cold porcelain,\" just like Keats's cold urn, implies that this is a lifeless, artificial work. Although Stevens appreciates the aesthetic effect of the flower arrangement, subliminally he is not satisfied with its lifelessness and otherness to human world. He desires more: in the closure of the next stanza, he will repeat the word \"more\" thrice, where \"more\" becomes almost obsessive.Now, get back to the title. How to justify \"The Poems of Our Climate\"? There are poets whose titles are throwaways, but not Stevens. Stevens cares a great deal about titles. His titles are always precise and integral to his poems. The first stanza seems to totally leave out the title, yet on a deeper level flower arrangement is a metaphor for poem writing. Metaphor is not an ordinary association of one object with another, but a figuration or trope which suggests the essence of one object by identifying it with certain qualities of another. Like Whitman, Stevens has an amazing command of figuration. For him, metaphor is a powerful means through which imagination imposes order on reality. \"The Poems of Our Climate\" opens with an objective description of clear water, brilliant bowl, pink and white carnations, and snowy light. As the poet is projecting his imaginary magic on those things, they will go through a metamorphosis and become metaphorical references to poetry writing, for both are the objects of formal arrangement, and both use delicate minimalism to achieve elaborate effect. Because this transfiguring act of mind is rooted in an objective world, the aura of duality shines through the images: they are at once flower arrangement and poetry writing. Indeed, what makes this poem \"poetic\" is the dynamic shifting back and forth between the real object and the metaphorical meanings it prompts.IISay even that this complete simplicityStripped one of all one's torments, concealedThe evilly compounded, vital IAnd made it fresh in a world of white,A world of clear water, brilliant-edged,Still one would want more, one would need more,More than a world of white and snowy scents.Stevens desires \"complete simplicity,\" but such \"simplicity\" is a trope for reduction and deprives him of the necessary pain and suffering in writing a poem. The capitalistic \"I\" is arresting, since Stevens always uses the impersonal \"one\" (\"one\" occurs four times in this stanza and six times in the whole poem), yet here he says \"The evilly compounded, vital I.\" In \"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction,\" \"I\" stands out again: \"What am I to believe? ...\" There is rhetorical power in the Stevensian \"I,\" which is almost electrifying. It recalls Whitman's \"real me\" or \"me myself\" in \"Song of Myself,\" for all these terms suggest a self that is one's consciousness but is a deeper and unknown part of one's consciousness. Stevens was very evasive about Whitman, one of his prime precursors. He never had anything good to say about Whitman in prose. Actually he blamed Whitman for Whitman's tramp persona. Yet, as Harold Bloom observes, \"Whitman is a deeper and darker presence/absence in Stevens's work.\" Good poetry in any language always depends on allusiveness. This stanza echoes a couplet in \"Song of Myself\":Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me ...As self-contradictory as the Whitmanian \"real me\" or \"me myself,\" the Stevensian \"I\" is both \"evilly-compounded\" and \"vital\" (this word is never negative). Bloom unravels the paradox by arguing that \"The `Vital I' is compounded evilly only because it is compounded at all.\" In other words, Stevens is talking about a radical duality of self or even a plurality of selves, on which he will not give a stable judgment. \"Vital\" is also to find its compelling resonance in \"the never-resting mind\" in the succeeding stanza. A critic believes that Stevens's inward peering \"I\" also implies its externally seeing homophone \"eye.\" I agree with this insightful reading, for the whole poem is built upon the act of looking and seeing. \"Still one would want more, one would need more, / More than a world of white and snowy scents\" builds a crescendo of \"mores\" and reinforces the theme of desire. Stevens was from New Jersey and in his native language \"scents\" allegedly sounds like \"senses,\" so here he might be making another homonymic pun.In this stanza, \"a world of white\" recurs once more. This time, it is the word \"brilliant-edged\" that unfolds new information. The edge is between what two sides? Japanese flower arrangement draws materials from nature; meanwhile, it is cut and placed by people. Thus, it is a product of setting art against nature, so is poetry. The edge makes clear the dichotomy of art vs. nature. Fundamentally, high literature, especially poetry, is a continuous tradition. This poem explores a single motif that emerges again and again in a succession of strong poets - the relation between art and nature. Stevens is concerned with creating some shape of order in the wilderness and chaos of reality. On the other hand, he refuses to transform and harmonize reality at the cost of making violent imposition upon it. Shelley, in \"A Defense of Poetry,\" realizes that \"even the greatest poetry will, through time, become nothing more than signs for classes of thought, loosing its poetic edge as a result.\" To find the finer edge of words, Stevens urges us to get rid of the illusion of things and get to the truth. In Stevens's own words, \"the hum of thoughts evaded in the mind.\" (\"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction\")This stanza is syntactically distinguished from the other stanzas for a single sentence runs through all seven lines, creating an extended \"suspension system.\" The effect is to have the completion of meaning constantly delayed, and to make the delay a means of defamiliarizing the process of conferring meanings. \"Say even that,\" like \"more like\" in line 3, is an American idiom, meaning \"granted that.\" It introduces a concessive clause and distantly echoes the adverb \"still\" five lines later. This pair of connectives frames the whole sentence or stanza. While in the first stanza, imagery is the dominant device and noun structures prevail, this stanza is characterized by strong statements and powerful verbs. \"Stripped,\" \"concealed,\" \"made it fresh\" are positioned either at the beginning or the end of lines, and in sequence they make a set of structural parallels. This compels us to recognize their weight in the meaning-making process.IIIThere would still remain the never-resting mind,So that one would want to escape, come backTo what had been so long composed.The imperfect is our paradise.Note that, in this bitterness, delight,Since the imperfect is so hot in us,Lies in flawed words and stubborn sounds.If the last stanza closes with a litotes or an understatement in which one's desire is expressed by negating its opposite (\"a world of white and snowy scents\"), this stanza will directly address that keen desire of \"the never-resting mind\": \"one would want to escape, come back / To what had been so long composed.\" Again and again in this poem, Stevens plays upon opposition and apposition. We have encountered \"Stripped\" and \"concealed,\" \"evilly-compounded\" and \"vital\" before, and now the oxymoronic \"escape\" and \"come back to\" again force us to pause and think hard. \"What had been so long composed\" sounds like a Nietzschean cosmos, whose nut is hollow and lacking any purpose or unity. It also reminds us of the Shakespearean motto: \"This is an art, which does mend nature, change it rather, but the art itself is nature\" (Winter's Tale).\"The imperfect is our paradise\" invites multiple readings as well. The first thing comes to mind is the famous biblical allusion. Since the fall, Adam and Eve had been expelled from the perfect Eden and living in the far-from-perfect earth. So, from the start human beings are destined to accept imperfection as our living paradise. This sentence also echoes the Robert Browning quote \"A man's reach should exceed his grasp,\" suggesting that poetry writing is a tantalizing project. To achieve artistic perfection, one should attempt even those seemingly impossible things, despite all necessary pains and suffering. Moreover, \"imperfect\" in Latin means \"unfinished.\" By brings back the etymological meaning of \"imperfect,\" Stevens revisits the Whitmanian theme: \"Nothing is final, he chants. No man shall see the end.\"This imperfect world demands an imperfect language, that is to say \"flawed words and stubborn sounds.\" The closing sentence starts with an imperative expression \"Note that\" and takes on the tone of an academic lecture. The shift of pronouns from \"one\" or \"I\" to \"our\" or \"us\" strengthens this sense of reaching out to others. As the poem moves towards closure, it is getting more and more disturbing, and the reader can feel a profound malaise on the part of the poet. Again, \"bitterness\" and \"delight\" are set in opposition, suggesting a puzzling psychic construction. \"The imperfect is so hot in us\" means the desire for imperfection is so fierce in us. \"Hot\" is used to contrast the earlier \"cold\" (\"Cold, a cold porcelain\"), and both words can apply respectively to their core meaning and extended meaning. \"Lies\" is an even more intriguing polyseme: delight tells us untruth in flawed words and stubborn sounds, and also consists in such words and sounds. In \"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction,\" Stevens brings forward three fundamental functions of poetry: It Must Be Abstract; It Must Change; It Must Give Pleasure. So, he shares Shelley's view that joy is what poetry emanates from (\"A Defense of Poetry\"). Yet such a joy is achieved by flawed words and stubborn sounds, in other words, the stylistic eccentricity and strangeness in Stevens's word choice and his experiment with the musical quality of poetry.Finally, in what sense do we know Stevens? Stevens is a poet of profound subjectivity. He is always working on wordplays, suggestions and subtlety. He is endless. We go down and down and down, and cannot reach the bottom, and would still want more and need more. He carries us so deep into nature and art and their intricate interplay.",

                "review/text": "Wallace Stevens is one of those rare writers who had a golden touch with words -- musical words, spellbinding imagery, and no boundaries to keep anyone from enjoying it. \"The Palm at the End of the Mind : Selected Poems and a Play\" brings together many of his best works, starting early in his writing career and stretching through the years.Over his lifetime, Stevens wrote several books of poetry, but his exquisite poems are best taken by themselves: the languid splendour of \"Sunday Morning,\" the spare eloquence of \"Man With A Blue Guitar,\" and the hymnlike grandeur of \"Le Monocle De Mon Oncle.\" (\"I know no magic trees, no balmy boughs,/No silver-ruddy, gold-vermilion fruits./But, after all, I know a tree that bears/A semblance to the thing I have in mind.\")This volume also contains his little-known one-act play, \"Bowl, Cat and Broomstick.\" Like many of his non-poetic works, this play deals with the nature of poetry, and is in the form of a dialogue between three seventeenth-century characters. It's part parody, part analysis. And while it's a bit weird, it's certainly worth reading.Wallace Stevens began publishing poetry at an importance time in writing history, when the older styles were falling away. But instead of ignoring one type of poetry in favor of another, he took the best of all kinds -- his verse combines Victorian opulance with the more modern free-form verse.Though he isn't as well known as Yeats or Williams, Stevens' poetry is one of the few kinds that is both technically good and emotionally rich. His poetry can be whimsical (\"Every time the bucks went clattering/Over Oklahoma/A firecat bristled in the way\"), but it is also meditative and philosophical, even tackling the nature of reality.If nothing else, Stevens' writing can be read just because it is exquisitely beautiful. He lavished details all over almost every poem he wrote; his style tends to be a bit on the ornate side -- Stevens freely uses the more exotic terms -- such as \"opalescence,\" \"pendentives\" and \"muleteers\" -- wrapped up in complex verse, sometimes with a rhyme scheme and sometimes free-form.\"The Palm at the End of the Mind\" is a wonderful collection of Wallace Stevens' most significant long poems, his underrated play, and his equally important smaller ones.

The poems are a selection, not the author's complete works, and they are presented in the order in which they were written. I like the book for the way the poems are presented on the page, with lots of white space around them available for penciling in your own notes; that's something you are likely to do a lot of with Stevens' poetry. (Then changing your mind, erasing, and writing new notes...)But otherwise the Library of America volume is to be preferred, because it is complete, not a selection, and because the poems are organized by the successive books of poems Stevens published. That edition also contains letters and other ancillary material of interest. But the LOA volume also has very thin pages and little margin space for notations. So, I've got the LOA volume for reference and this \"Palm\" volume for notations. Works out pretty well, and between the the two you have just about everything.",

Ginsberg frequently writes about different Hindu gods and goddesses, reflecting his deep interest in and knowledge of Indian culture. There are a series of photographs that compliment the written words very well; as opposed to the original printing of this book, there are several new photographs included.

        "description": "When first published in 2004, Danger on Peaks was the poet's first new collection of poems in twenty years. Perhaps his most personal, autobiographical collection, it begins with the young poet ascending Mt. St. Helens in 1945, a climb accidentally timed with the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was 15 years old. Almost sixty years later, after the great Buddhas at Bamiyan Valley were bombed and with the victims of the World Trade Center also \"turned to dust,\" the poet composed a prayer while at Short Grass Temple in Senso-ji, a pilgrim on the path of Kannon, Goddess of Mercy. This remarkable collection was greeted with broad praise, and as Julia Martin proclaimed, \"Moving between relative and absolute ways of seeing, [Snyder] responds to the experience of global conflict and personal pain by reminding readers of the continuity of wildness, affirming the value of art, and invoking an ancient practice of wisdom and compassion.\"",

                "review/text": "While discussing Stanley Burnshaw's 'The Seamless Web', Guy Davenport summed up exactly how I felt after reading 'The Geography of the Imagination'. \"It is like being in the room with a charmingly intelligent man who has found a big subject in several hundred books. He attacks the subject this way, that way, pointing out this astuteness and that perception, all the while taking down book after book and reading the relevant passage. Having heard him to the end, you are still a bit puzzled as to how you might condense it all for its coherence and thrust, but you are aware that it is an important discussion you've heard.\"The 'coherence and thrust' is quite plain - the problem is that 'The Geography of the Imagination' begins just shy of where my education ends, and then shoots upward, stratospherically, from there. Whereas I thought I knew something about the humanities and their historical perspective, I was astonished at how limited my fractional knowledge really was, and how ably Mr. Davenport exposed my boundaries by linking modern, often unappreciated, masterworks to the classical past in ways I would never have seen unassisted.That's the thrust - modern literature and poetry and art and even music and architecture peeled back layer by layer to uncover their links to antiquity - and how those allusions to the past skip over the present's community conscious like a flat rock across a shallow creek. I may see something in these works that resonates, but I don't know why, or else only dimly recognize the references. Guy Davenport, on the other hand, zips back and forth between the ages, then laterally across genres and mediums, teasing out parallels and themes between such strange bedfellows as, for example, Poe, Grant Wood, and the myth of Persephone, sure-handedly leading the reader through a byzantine maze of arcana and out into fuller perspectives.At times I wonder if Mr. Davenport hasn't read too much into his subjects - could these artists and writers have purposely added *all* that he sees in their work? It doesn't matter, because there are plenty of other connections that ring true, and the point isn't so much whether the artists were aware of it as that, with the trained eye (or guided, as I was by the author), it's possible to recognize and appreciate the subtleties permeating their art. However, Mr. Davenport also makes it clear that the people he writes about absolutely intended for most of these allusions to be there. For instance, when he delves into poetry, I was simply astounded at the precise and compact ordering of words and myth and oblique references by the masters. It's like a coded text, an intuited lingua franca for people who meet at the non-Euclidean borders of dreams and the subconscious.While Mr. Davenport makes a strong case for the poets he believes in, poetry, for me, is only a slight interest, and I think it's important to note that the book's first half is almost exclusively about poets and their work. These are poets (Pound, Zukofsky, Marianne Moore, Charles Olson, Jonathan Williams and Ronald Johnson, among others) and their poems that the author expects us to be quite familiar with already, and honestly, many of these sections were over my head. Still, I value quite highly the introduction to the concepts behind this type of poetry, and to the other subjects also, as an extension to an incomplete education.Other highlights are sections on Eudora Welty, James Joyce, Osip Mandelstam (who was previously unknown to me), and anecdotal essays concerning Joyce Kilmer, Wittgenstein, Charles Ives, and Shelley's Ozymandias. Except describing any particular essay of Mr. Davenport's as limited to one person misses the point entirely. In the imagination's geography, every country shares a border and a history, and, as the author demonstrates, it is impossible to write about one without examining the others. And even if much of the territory is terra incognito for me, his demanding and un-condescending essays are perfect launching pads for further explorations.",

Pound's Cantos? and he moves without hesitation to a philosopher widely viewed as extremely eccentric and hard to understand: Wittgenstein. To put it in another way, if YOU can't make head or tail of someone, you're likely to find that someone on Davenport's list of favorites.But when he flies closer to earth (\"closer to the understanding of mere mortals\") he has some of his best moments, in my opinion. His chapter on Whitman is really excellent, although you may find his insistence that the internal combustion engine has made life dull a bit of a stretcher. His essay on \"Hobbitry\" is excellent, and he even manages to say something interesting about Joyce Kilmer's \"Trees!\"If you have an interest in 20th-century literature, you should take a look at this book.

As his starting point, Peake examines the widespread historical belief that the mid-brain's pine-cone shaped pineal gland activates the third eye described by mystics and seers. Through careful analysis of ancient religious texts and artifacts, he gives evidence that the spiritual properties of the pineal gland have been embedded in myths and cultures across the globe. (Why else would the Buddha so often be found wearing a pine cone hat?) Peake then shows that it is through this small organ that we experience lucid dreaming, out-of-body experiences, hypnagogic imagery, near-death experiences, astral travel and the kundalini experience.

Beautiful and sensitive, this lacks the passion of \"Praise,\" but has a mellow charm of its own.Hass ponders his childhood, and the childhood of the US: visions of the Franciscan priests coming to California, and bringing illness with them -- \"They meant so well, she said, and such a terrible thing/came here with their love...\" He looks back on his mother, on his father's death, and his bond with his brother in college. Not to mention \"Sonnet,\" as a man listens lovingly to his ex-wife's voice.But don't think that Hass only contemplates family. He also fixes his eye on nature -- weather, plants, animals, mountains, and the almost magical web that surrounds them in his writing. Even when writing a gritty piece on an airstrip, \"Layover,\" he pauses to describe the \"snowy mountains,\" \"moose feeding along the frozen streams/snow foxes hunting ptarmigans...\" His infatuation with nature peaks in the exquisite \"Woods in New Jersey,\" and the dreamlike \"Iowa City: Early April.\"Good poets are remembered, while mediocre ones are usually forgotten quickly. Robert Hass is one of the former. His descriptions of love, loss and nature are striking and beautiful, and in that \"Sun Under Wood\" is not a change. It's an evolution -- rather than the fire and passion of his earlier works, this is a quieter, meditative collection.The peak of his writing in \"Sun Under Wood\" is \"English: An Ode,\" an apparent tribute to the power of words. It seems fragmented even for free-style poetry, but as it's read it makes more and more sense -- it explores words, their roots, their meanings, and their evocations, only to end on a distinctly romantic note. It also seems quite appropriate, since his poetry is so evocative. Without having to use dramatic words, Hass brings to mind snowy woods, noisy tarmacs, a tearful eye or a creek fringed by fronds.Hass's writing has changed over time, and \"Sun Under Wood\" is a polished, contemplative collection of beautiful poetry.

                "review/text": "In this book, Robert Hass treads close along the confessional risk line but never quite seems to slip over it. This avoidance is tricky, given the highly personal material in most poems here. (I'd define the CRL as the point at which a poet fails to generate sympathy in the reader when discussing what is posed as personal pain - truly autobiographical or not.) He manages not to trip up by the masterful use of several strategies:1. Distraction: when approaching the kernel of pain in a poem, he mouths around it, noting with palpable wonder the beauty and strangeness of the natural world before returning to the kernel for another little gnaw. Eventually acceptance - not so much resolution, which is hard to find in this book - is the reward of rationed philosophical nibbling. In poem after poem, Nature is a necessary source of healing distraction, and occasionally so are the imagined lives of other people. What's implicit is a deep sense of trust in the process of healing, which requires time and attention, but not necessarily to the pain.2. Fluidity: structural as well as tonal. Distracting himself and the reader when things start to sting could very well make for clunky, ungenerous verse, but his casual tone (which rarely if ever asks for pity, instead lingering over what excites his curiosity) somehow brings us along willingly. Even when the interruptions are overt (\"Interrupted Meditation\", \"Regalia for a Black Hat Dancer\"), he doesn't derail. Perhaps this is because the reader has been coaxed into accepting Hass's constant shuttle between private musing and scrupulous description by3. Beautiful, accurate language: Hass has a fine eye, and a fine ear to match. \"dragonback of pine\", \"toss off grails of pure white idly\" - the book sings often enough to singlehandedly justify the reader's attention. It's nice that Hass mostly refrains from simply treating his natural materials as springboards for hokey or artificial metaphors - as the old man says in \"Interrupted Meditation\", Hass doesn't excel at metaphor - but he does excel at bringing non-human life to vivid presence on the page.This book is largely about overcoming pain - not in the sense of triumph, but in the sense of swallowing, ingesting, receiving, and transforming. The ideas aren't all that big - just big enough to be useful and pleasurable. As Hass navigates his sorrow, we're glad he invited us along.",

A good thing when you need to write.Lyrical, fluid, spot-on. A small prize.\"A Reader\" says this is \"More nature stuff,\" and I always get bristly when I hear that. \"More nature stuff\" sounds a bit reductive and condescending, don't you think? \"A Reader\" goes on to say that Hass \"seems more resigned than before as to what life brings and is not fighting for happiness.\" Well. I don't think that writing a book of poems qualifies as resignation.\"I had the idea that the world's so full of pain / it must sometimes make a kind of singing. / And that the sequence helps, as much as order helps-- / First an ego, and then pain, and then the singing.\"",

There is no resignation or distance in the work, it is deeply intimate and passionate. However, it is decidedly lacking in the immature rebellion against human reality. That rebellion relies on dualistic constructions: good experience vs. bad experience, good vs. evil, etc. Nature, of which humanity IS, can provide all the examples for finding our place in our world, no matter the pleasure or displeasure of our daily experiences. \"nature stuff\"--the very expression is absurd, its flavor indicative of the disconnection humankind lives with by choice.This book is simply wonderful, cover to cover. Hass creates a long ignored need for peaceful contemplation of the common ignorance of the richness of life we move too quickly past, discard and unconsciously dismiss as unimportant.Amazing imagery, flowing rhythm, new and precise 'witnessing' of nature and nature's meaning along with human sorrow. It gets uncomfortable, the way great poetry should, and yet Hass resolves the 'disenchantment' is very beautiful ways.Highly recommended.",

The wild and seductive energy in this collection never lets one put the book down.

        "description": "Originally produced in 1793, Visions of the Daughters of Albion has become one of Blake's most widely read and interpreted prophecies. The main character is a liberation figure challenging not only male chauvinism and marriage but the institution of slavery and imperialism in general. The female protagonist Oothoon, a sex slave who is raped by the slave driver Bromion, is clearly made to represent both the fertile, virginal and innocent lands of the pre-colonialism New World and the oppression of the women of Blake's time, who were, like slaves, treated as property of their husbands. In the course of his poem Oothoon becomes the ultimate symbol for liberation both as a woman and as a slave. William Blake (1757 - 1827) was a British poet, painter, visionary mystic, and engraver, who illustrated and printed his own books. Blake proclaimed the supremacy of the imagination over the rationalism and materialism of the 18th-century. Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of both the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age.",

To read such books as Jerusalem, America and Songs of Innocence and of Experience in cold letterpress bears no comparison to seeing and reading them as Blake conceived them, infused with his sublime and exhilarating colours. At times tiny figures and forms dance among the lines of the text, flames appear to burn up the page, and dense passages of Biblical-sounding text are brought to a jarring halt by startling images of death, destruction and liberation. This edition, produced together with The William Blake Trust, contains all the pages of Blakes twenty or so illuminated books reproduced in true size, an appendix with all Blakes text set in type and an introduction by the noted Blake scholar, David Bindman.

William Blake's longer poems, the so-called Prophetic Books, are legendary in their difficulty. Each of the two great epics, \"Milton\" and \"Jerusalem\", is a world in itself, taking years or decades to explore. Everyone who has made the effort considers it time well spent.Blake wasn't shy about the importance of his own work. In a letter he described \"Milton\" as \"the Grandest Poem this World Contains\". But these immense, unique hand-engraved, hand-coloured cosmic-spiritual epics found no buyers in Blake's own lifetime. Only one coloured copy of \"Jerusalem\" is known to exist.The Illuminated Books have been reproduced in colour before, but this is the first time all the plates have been printed full-size in a single book. Blake is fascinating even in black-and-white, but to read these books in the form intended means entering a new world. By depicting spiritual principles as People, Blake shows us the meaning of all ancient gods.After the lyrics of the \"Songs of Innocence and \"Songs of Experience\", the best place to start is the \"Book of Thel\", then the \"Visions of the Daughters of Albion\". When reading the long books, a plain text copy of the \"Complete Poems\" will come in handy: difficulty in reading Blake's graceful orange script for \"Jerusalem\" may be one difficulty too many. The remaining shorter books, with their anguished mythical narratives, rely more than the others on their illustrations, printed as if with fire, rust and soot: images of an age of Revolution.Blake's aim was nothing less than \"to open the immortal Eyes/ Of Man into the Worlds of Thought, into Eternity/ Ever expanding in the Bosom of God, the Human Imagination\". Astonishingly this is not exaggeration nor plain craziness: he can actually do this.If a book I admire gets five stars, this one deserves fifteen.

He hand-wrote all the text in his books and, while beautiful in its own right, my myopic little eyes have a hard time sussing out the actual words. The editors of this book helpfully include a type-written transcript of his poetry and prose... at the back of the book. There are a few pages where the text is transcripted onto the page below the original copy, but I feel that it should have been done for most of the book, since the \"actual size\" images leave a lot of white space that isn't utilized.

        "description": "Until recently, Iranian literature has overwhelmingly been the domain of men. But the new hybrid culture of diaspora Iranians has produced a prolific literature by women that reflects a unique perspective and voice. Let Me Tell You Where I've Been is an extensive collection of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction by women whose lives have been shaped and influenced by Iran's recent history, exile, immigration and the formation of new cultural identities in the United States and Europe. These writings represent an emerging and multi-cultural female sensibility. Unlike many flat media portrayals of Iranian women-as veiled, silenced-these writers offer a complex literary view of Iranian culture and its influences. These writers interrogate, challenge, and re-define notions of home and language and their work offers readers an experience of Iranian diaspora culture. Featuring over one hundred selections (two-thirds of which have never been published before) by more than fifty contributors--including such well-known writers as Gelareh Asayesh, Tara Bahrampour, Firoozeh Dumas, Roya Hakakian and Mimi Khalvati--the collection represents a substantial diversity of voices in this multicultural community. Divided into six sections, the book's themes of exile, family, culture resistance, and love, create a rich and textured view of the Iranian diaspora. The poems, short stories, and essays are suggestive of an important conversation about Iran, Iranian culture, the Persian and English languages, and the dual identities of many of its authors. This powerful collection is a tribute to the wisdom, insight, and sensitivity of women attempting to invent and articulate a literature of in-betweenness.",

A voyage that was carried despite significant prejudice and eradication of an assortment of their basic rights. It is also a narrative of the immigration experience, being subjected to intolerance and narrow-mindedness on a different level and yet succeeding despite the odds. These incredible women are telling their story and the story of all of us who experience conflict, affection, separation, contradictions and intolerance, while struggling to maintain a conventional existence.

Sullivan, author of \"Exiled Memories: Stories of the Iranian Diaspora.\" A list of the contributors include Tara Bahrampour, Susan Atefat-Peckham, Firoozeh Dumas, Farnoosh Moshiri, Azadeh Moaveni, and other less familiar writers such as Leyla Momeny, Gelareh Asayesh, Niloofar Kalaam, and Farnaz Fatemi. Certainly many kudos are owed to Professor Persis Karim, teacher of English and comparative literature at San Jose State University, for amassing this wondrous, stunning collection. The selections are organized by theme into six different main areas: Home Stories, For Tradition, Woman's Duty, Axis of Evil, Beyond, and Tales Left Untold Subjects include differentiating dual and multi-cultural identities, sexuality, love, traditional expectation and its failure, politics, gender, blood and suffering, and the desperate poignancy of silence. There is so much to absorb in this collection, it is so very rich. It is certainly a fragrant beginning to enable Western to grasp the barest outlines of the complexity and courage of these women and their worlds and cultures. It is impossible to read any part of this book and come away unchanged. \"But she wants to step into/the whiteness of this inferno/and search Madison/for someone in his life/with the power to change him:/daughter, father, wife./She would become that person/undress him in the daytime/stand naked in front of him./say, look at what we've wrapped in./See this soft scraped creamy dark thing? It/s life.\" Farnaz Fatemi (p. 240)",

This is a beautiful book--nice, heavy, slick pages, wonderful photographs, and the poems are laid out in a way that invites the eye to linger. Lax's poems are stil spare, and these are interesting in that they are long exercises in peeling apart the poet's own life and consciousness. They're more like his \"21 pages\" and journal entries than the short \"Fables\" or even the long, abstract island poems--yet still retain his trademark short broken syllable style. And for this reason, they're very involving. You feel closer to the center of Lax's world than ever before, as if you're invading his private world, sitting in his bedroom late at night watching as he whittles away at himself with words. Also included are several essays, one detailing Lax's final trip home, an interview (as I recall), and some other miscellaneous essays. Whether you love the poetry or loved the man himself, or both, this is necessary reading.",

Brought into the quiet, serene world of Robert Lax, living on a remote Greek island, one feels the hectic turmoil of life slip away.Black and white photography present an old man, lover of cats, who lived in a small room, bed in one corner, \"study\" in another, table, sofa and chairs in another. Living a simple, hermit life, this writer gave up the modern dream of accumulating fame and fortune. Lax attempted to bring attention and love to the world every moment of every day.This poet's slowed down, minimalist style intrigued Europeans long before his fellow Americans. The extremely focused, train of thought poetry will not attract those looking for a \"quick read\" or lovely nature poetry.

        "description": "This collection of thoughts from artists and thinkers of the past and present has been lovingly gathered over many years in the personal journals of the artist Astrid Fitzgerald and reveals something of the mystery in which creativity finds its way from the energies of the cosmos into the imagination and faculties of the individual artist and eventually into the solitude of the studio and finally into a work of art. From the reports of mystics to the observations of scientists, these passages have been arranged in this volume to provide brief glimpses into the recesses of artistic being, into the tentative formations in consciousness, the first glimmers of imagination, the distinctive faculties of the creative mind, and the tensions of artistic expression in the workshop and the creative life. Fitzgerald's great contribution has been to gather into a meaningful collection the words of 2,500 years of genius as a resource and inspiration for all those who would break out of creative limitations and take a bold step into the future. Illustrated with the art of the author and others.

He is very much interested in what it means to be an artist and a black man. In his first collection, Muscular Music, he took the reader through a living library of cultural icons, from Shaft and Fat Albert to John Coltrane and Miles Davis. His second collection, Hip Logic, continued these explorations of popular culture, fatherhood, cultural heritage, and loss. Wind in a Box, Hayes's resonant new collection, continues his interest in how traditions (of poetry and culture alike) can be simultaneously upended and embraced. The struggle for freedom (the wind) within containment (the box) is the unifying motif as Hayes explores how identity is shaped by race, heritage, and spirituality. This new book displays not only what the Los Angeles Times calls the range of a \"bold virtuoso,\" but also the imaginative fervor of a poet in love with poetry.",

Emily Dickinson puts poets above the sun and God in pantheon of what's most important, and people like Raymond Carver prove her right. Although this last offering by the 20th century's greatest minimalist writer is neither his greatest nor his most minimal, it strikes the same generous chord of longing, of heart warming simplicity and heart breaking honesty, that Carver strikes elsewhere. The style is the man, wrote Buffon (in French), and sure enough that is the case here: a style of simple emotional honesty, combined with an artist's experimental will to playfulness, sufffused with a hope whose transcendent beauty is precisely its distillation from the undoctored elements of ordinary reality. This book, enhanced and completed by Tess Gallagher's wonderfully loving but unsentimental introduction, shows Carver at the end of his life; still excited about art, and the possibility of the poem form, he splices lines from Chekov stories, giving them titles and therebytransforming them into poem epigraphs to his own measured prose. The transformation of the Chekov short story to the Carver poem perhaps underscores the poetic process itself, whittling down reality into its artistic essence--the process so aptly demonstrated by Carver, who never wrote a novel, in his short stories. As Salmon Rushdie says on the cover (I paraphrase), read this book by Carver. Read everything by Carver. Raymond Carver was a great writer.",

It was put together with the help of the love and companion of the last eleven years of his life, the writer Tess Gallagher.

His poems are often stories built around direct observations or statements of his present mood, a mood that is also reflective on other times of life. The poems which I believe are most moving often have to do with relationships, with his father, with his former wife, with his children.His world is often a disordered and painful one, the alcoholic's world , the world of those in debt and down. But there is in him almost always a redemptive appreciation of life, a certain hidden joy and emotional surprise which gives the poems their special life.Among the beautiful poems of this work is one called 'Cherish' in which he tells of the tenderness in his relationship with Tess Gallagher.I was very moved by the last poem , a fragment that sums up the man and the redemptive power of his work.LATE FRAGMENTAnd did you get whatyou wanted from this life, even so?I did.And what did you want?To call myself beloved, to feel myselfbeloved on the earth.",

Sebald: \"An extraordinarily handsome edition of poems by the late great writer\" (\"Confrontation\"). \"Unrecounted\" combines thirty-three of what W.G. Sebald called his \"micropoems\"--miniatures as unclassifiable as all of his works--with thirty-three exquisitely exact lithographs by one of his oldest friends, the acclaimed artist Jan Peter Tripp. The lithographs portray, with stunning precision, pairs of eyes--the eyes of Beckett, Borges, Proust Jasper Johns, Francis Bacon, Tripp, Sebald, Sebald's dog Maurice. Brief as haiku, the poems are epiphanic and anti-narrative. What the author calls \"time lost, the pain of remembering, and the figure of death\" here find a small home. The art and poems do not explain one another, but rather engage in a kind of dialogue. \"The longer I look at the pictures of Jan Peter Tripp,\" Sebald comments in his essay, \"the better I understand that behind the illusions of the surface, a dread-inspiring depth is concealed.

And my second thought was that the good people at New Directions are really milking his posthumous fame to try to sell this puzzling \"keepsake,\" as they call it, for $22.95, when it is so manifestly inferior to his other books. But luckily I kept the book on top of my desk for awhile and presently found myself returning to it again and again, trying to puzzle out what made it different than other books of poetry I had read. These \"micropoems,\" as the translator calls them, do creep under your skin.Here's one:The housein the nightthrough the windowsthe flickering light offlamesThat's it! As New Directions lays them out, these lines are all centered a la Michael McClure (it's hard to tell if Sebald planned this effect.) By the way the translator (Michael Hamburger) must be British and I wonder what a good US translator could have done with the German of these poems which the editor has supplied as an appendix for our eluctation at the back of the book. They are so short you could copy them all out on your lunch hour, but they gain weight and resonance by their placement next to the lithographs that inspired them-33 portraits by Sebald's best friend Jan-Peter Tripp) of people's eyes. (A lot of the poetry is about questions of seeing, perception, realization, etc) I thought I recognized some of the faces and I was right in one case only. The eyes are mostly those of famous artists (Francis Bacon, rembrandt, Jasper Johns, Barnett Newman) and writers (Capote, Borges, Burroughs) and some of the juxtapositions attain a transparency as luminous as ice water. But you don't find out whose eyes they are until the end, so the volume has the aspect of a parlor game to it. By the way, check out page 74.

In Sebald's words \"The longer I look at the pictures of Jan Peter Tripp, the better I understand that behind the illusions of the surface, a dread-inspiring depth is concealed. It is the metaphysical lining of reality, so to speak.\"As a devoted reader of all of Sebald's output I was eagerly looking forward to yet another posthumous document from this astonishingly fine writer. What is in this handsome volume is not really 'poetry' but rather brief haiku-like musings. Not that they aren't lovely, it is just that they are not up to the challenging standards of his novels. Still one is left with a satisfied feeling having read this (sideways printed) book of thoughts. The art of Tripp is stunning - eyes of famous writers and thinkers. In the end, in Sebald's own critical self examination, these works are \"time lost, the pain of remembering, and the figure of death\". As such, they gain more meaning. Grady Harp, September 05",

                "review/text": "It would be unfair to suggest that anyone who disagrees with Bloom is simply suffering from the escapist, repressive anxiety of which he claims to be a theorist. Likewise, it would be a circular argument to say that anyone who finds Bloom's stance self-defeating is merely an anxious ephebe trying to justify their own mediocrity, to dissemble their own belatedness, to obscure the deeper issues of poetic originality.Or would it?I've been ridiculed for saying this, but *The Anxiety of Influence* is a very harsh, very difficult little book. And yes, most writers *do* tend to shrug it off with defensive laughter and glib overconfidence. \"Bloom's theories don't apply to me, after all. *I* don't feel the anxiety of which he speaks. I'm as young as Adam in the literary Garden of Eden, and my work is as important and worthwhile as I wish it to be.\" Thus tolls the death-knell of the M.F.A. student in Creative Writing.Bloom's vision of the Canon has nothing to do with a required list of books, with the \"carrion-eaters\" of Tradition, paying uncritical knee-tribute to precedents and precursors. Bloom is simply reminding us that literature is not created in a vacuum of Edenic self-deception (the bland, cheeky optimism of the writing workshop), but rather in the poetomachia of the solitary apprentice testing himself against the creations of the past and present, a gladiatorial dialogue with the collective personae of Anteriority. In other words, the greatest literature is in competition with *itself*, an internalized version of the Canon that each strong poet carries within. The competition is both loving and malicious, and the \"precursor\" is always a composite of texts and artists, including contemporary authors fighting for imaginative and thematic territory, spurring each other on to higher achievements while stampeding the fallen.For polemical purposes, Bloom simplifies the \"composite precursor\" in his reading of the English Romantics, testing themselves against the canonical strangeness of one John Milton. By casting the Miltonic Satan as the modern poet *in extremis*, Bloom creates a critical mythology as compelling as it is melodramatic, working through the byzantine evasions and torque-laden inversions the ephebe undertakes to carve out an imaginative space for himself. The \"revisionary ratios\" are derived from the Kabbalah of Isaac Luria, conceptualizing poetic creation as a heroic self-purgation and regeneration, achieving originality with an apparent loss of power, then returning to the fold for fresh melee and assimilative combat. Bloom's conscious objective is TO MAKE THE POET'S JOB MORE DIFFICULT, the smash complacency where it lives, in the Eliotic idealizations of \"Tradition and the Individual Talent\", which argues (catastrophically, in Bloom's view) that poetry is the benign and empyreal handing-down of the Muse's wedding-band from precursor to ephebe. But as Bloom persuasively argues, Eliot's stuffy and pretentious election of Dante as his true poetic father desperately obscures his true debts to Tennyson and Whitman, and his poetry may be weaker as a result. The casualties of Eliot's \"poetic pacifism\" lie forgotten in the charnel-house of unknown soldiers who've mistaken academic careerism for the deeper mysteries of canonical anguish, who've taken the low road of insularity against the combative \"wakening of the dead.\"To suggest that this sort of gladiatorial perspectivizing is \"self-defeating\" is rather like calling Nietzsche a \"nihilist\" because he chose to philosophize with a hammer -- that is, dedicated himself to scraping away all the evasions, the happy-go-lucky subterfuge -- to provide a more truthful genealogy of art and creativity and, more importantly, an Ethics on precisely what is required of writers (born this late in history) pretending to canonical strength. *TAoI* is as Nietzschean a text as you will find, a polemical kick in the stomach, brutal in its necessities, staring deep into the horizon of literature and conceptualizing the intra-poetic psychic warfare of poets WHO WILL NOT DIE. It is a nail-bomb thrown into the seminar-room of creative writing workshops, exploding the glib complacency of young writers who've forgotten that Time is unforgiving in its choice of literary survivors.To put it another way, Bloom never says that originality doesn't exist, only that our idealized, Eliotic perceptions of originality are immature and self-defeating, an excuse not only to *be* mediocre (as young as Adam at the dawn of Creation), but to revel in and celebrate that mediocrity. That said, those who are coddled by Academe will probably find Bloom's book vulgar, incomprehensible, melodramatic, even paranoid in its implications. While others, stoically self-critical, will find themselves reading a completely different book, and a glorious one at that.As the previous reviewer suggested, there may be room enough in the academic industry for a communal fellowship of writers and teachers, but there is an important qualitative difference between the respectable productions of, say, a Mark Van Doren, and the monstrous achievements of canonical prowess Bloom examines here. Mediocrity needs to justify itself, to make excuses for its smug complacency, but just as 99.9% of our generation's literature is \"written in water,\" so the canonical survivors of the future will be forced to take even more extreme measures to be remembered, to stand in the square where martyrs are made. Bloom's book, in essence, attempts to dramatize and account for these \"extreme measures.\"*The Anxiety of Influence*, for all its conceptual flummery and Rube Goldberg convolutions, stands today as a brilliant thought-experiment on the lengths genius will go to stamp itself in bronze, to carry on and flourish in a universe of Death (or its literary equivalent, Compromise). Even if you find his main argument pedantic and repulsive, Bloom provides dozens of pyrotechnic micro-arguments in each chapter, not to mention some brilliant and provocative readings of classic poetry. Bloom is a great talker and showman, and those who dismiss his theories as frivolous poppycock may still be charmed by his brash, Hazlittean personality. The important thing is to take the time to understand where Bloom is coming from, and not to project one's own anxieties onto this difficult and rewarding text.",

Yes, Bloom's work is filled with tremendously interesting insights into Literature,remarkable unexpected connections between creators who seemed so distant from each other.No, Literature does not follow the simple law of progression, or the simple Law of a creator's strong reaction to the strong creators before. There are figures in Literature who in some way seem to be reacting to no one( Hopkins is one good example) and figures whose whole discourse is in absorbing the creation of others not to transcend them but to celebrate them.( Borges) There are also creators who however they may be influenced by others, as Kafka was influenced by Dickens and perhaps Kierkegaard, have such a unique way of seeing the world that they seem to be born of themselves. In Literature it is not necessary always to stand on the shoulders of Giants much less knock the Giant down if one is to move forward.The laws of literary creation are as mysterious and individual as the next new voice which comes to the world.

This book makes the context clear, but a general reader still might not understand how concrete this difficulty is because THE ANXIETY OF INFLUENCE is overtly a book about poetry, and hardly at all about exercising judgment. The page of the book where I left it open the longest, and where the book subsequently opened most easily, and which I read most often in the five weeks in which I was interested in this book, was page 58, which describes a poet who \"experiences anxiety necessarily towards any danger that might end him as a poet.\" Without dwelling on the personalities of the people involved, it seems to me that the anxiety which this book is about is clearest in the case of the presidential election of 2000, in which the ability of the Florida Supreme Court to act as the ultimate judges of that opportunity to count ballots was subject to the power of the United States Supreme Court to judge the election in some way which would produce a result which would be opposite to what a majority of the Florida Supreme Court desired. (...)and poets can be much more open about what they are doing than judges, so it isn't too surprising that this book is about poets.Freud and Nietzsche form a nice frame of reference for what is happening in this book. I kept looking for mentions of Rilke, which wasn't fruitful until page 99, the first page on \"Daemonization or The Counter-Sublime.\" There it says, \"History, to Rilke, was the index of men born too soon, but as a strong poet Rilke would not let himself know that art is the index of men born too late. . . . the dialectic between art and art, or what Rank was to call the artist's struggle against art . . . governed even Rilke, who outlasted most of his blocking agents, for in him the revisionary ratio of daemonization was stronger than in any other poet of our century.\" There is a page just before page 99 which quotes Emerson on the highest truth about all things going well, \"long intervals of time, years, centuries, are of no account.\" (p. 98). Emerson shows up again on page 138, with the idea, \"Who seem to die live,\" to precede the final section of the book, \"Apophrates or The Return of the Dead.\" This part doesn't relate well to law, particularly for a system which keeps thinking that a judgment like the death penalty might be considered final at some point.",

For me, this falls into the former category. I think this is an important book far beyond the study of literature and poetry. I was first alerted to it in a book by Richard Rorty who drew on it for broader philosophical and cultural insights and that is where I see its value. I have no idea if it works as a \"theory\" of poetry but it certainly captures one important aspect of the challenge of cultural and individual change and growth, namely that sometimes both societies and individuals feel the weight of their precursors as inhibiting. Bloom puts this challenge very vividly: it is \"the horror of finding oneself to be only a replica, a copy; or becoming only a reader, i.e. drowning in the precursors.\" Is this perhaps why we readers feel we must write these reviews?",

I used the book as a foundation for writing a paper about John Milton's influence on 18th-century English poet Thomas Gray, and each stage of poetic growth that Bloom discusses provides endless possibilities for explicating the meta-textual meanings of any poem when placed in context to its predecessors. Bloom's writing style is highly erudite and may seem dauntingly academic at first, but his ideas are often very clear and proceed in a highly logical manner (despite various tangents about the origins of Bloom's chosen terms).The book may require more than one close reading to fully understand Bloom's dense and complex theory, but in each read, one finds more passages fulfill the book's overarching thesis. The book may not be of much use to someone who is not interested in poetry or literary studies, but worth a read if you're into studying poetry or literary critical theory of any type. Bloom is also one of our century's most important (if debated) critics, and should be required reading for all interested in English literature and theory.",

This book takes an original approach to still life in modern literature and the visual arts by examining the potential for movement and transformation in the idea of stillness and the ordinary. It ranges widely in its material, taking Czanne and literary responses to his still life painting as its point of departure. It investigates constellations of writers, visual artists and dancers including D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, David Jones, Winifred Nicholson, Wallace Stevens, and lesser-known figures including Charles Mauron and Margaret Morris. Claudia Tobin reveals that at the heart of modern art were forms of stillness that were intimately bound up with movement: the still life emerges charged with animation, vibration and rhythm; an unstable medium, unexpectedly vital and well suited to the expression of modern concerns.",
