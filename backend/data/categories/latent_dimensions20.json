The story can be tidious for the reader after the intial campaign of 1914 degenerates into the grotesque trench warfare that symbolizes the conflict. Hart repeatedly points out specific tactical mistakes, and grand strategic shortcomings in the allied command. Allenby's campaign in the Middle East is presented as the best allied action of the war. Hart concentrates on the actual fighting, but still brings in the political and social aspects of the Great War. In one of the book's sharpest comments the author insinuates the English government and the English people could be accused of &quot;infanticide&quot; for being so ill prepared for war when they sent a generation of men to die in trenches on the continent. Hart shows what a close ran affair the war was until German miscalculations and allied diplomacy brought the United States into the war. A somber subject brought to life with gripping insights.",

I was looking for a book that would give me good overview of WWI, filling in the details left out in the brief mentions found in our high school history books. And this after reading an abridged version of Winston Churchill's &quot;The Great War&quot;. Captain Hart's account is not for someone looking for an &quot;easy read&quot;. I don't know of any substaintial account of this war that could be written as an &quot;easy read&quot;. Of course Captian Hart is writing with 20-20 hindsight, so he is able to see and give account of the miscalculations and errors. Would we have done any better then Foch and the other allied Generals under the times and circumstances? I have my doubts, but we are in the &quot;now&quot; and can learn from the tragic mistakes of the past. If ever war was &quot;hell&quot;, it was so in the trenches of France. Somewhere in France near the Argonne Forest rests the mortal remains of Pvt. George Britton, my great-uncle, killed exactly 4 weeks before the Armistice. In Hart's account, I at least find some facts to help me understand what happened there, and come to grips somewhat with why my Uncle died at a young age, far from home and family. RIP",

As usually, human being reckon others merits too much time later. The whole Liddell Hart work it's an example. Had military staffs read him carefully before WWII, perhaps the output would has been otherwise, or at least different. So may be said about the further wars. &quot;The Real War 1914-1918&quot; is a veritable good analysis of the entanglement that led to war. But not only on military factors, as often happens. He included political, economical and even psycological considerations. Instead of a narrative reconstruction, his abarcative and reflexive study is a pretty good proof about what a writer can do if he possess knowledge, patience, and vocation to teach. As reader can verify by himself with &quot;Real War&quot; on his hands (&quot;Strategy&quot;, &quot;Germans Generals Talk&quot; or the others Liddell Hart's books as well), with a such kind of master, every book becomes sadly too much short. Thus, among the books I have had opportunity to read about WWI, I deem &quot;The Real War 1914-1918&quot; simply the best one. You won't be disappointed by your choice.",

The Americans logically resolve to annex whatever territories they've conquered.Turtledove's character development remains strong even as events become more dramatic. Bigotry and bitterness co-exist in many a heart. Confederate Soldier Jake Featherston, who blames the defeat on blacks and C.S. brass, is a sure candidate to lead a postwar, Nazi-like Ku Klux Klan.Turtledove gives too much treatment to superficial, unpleasant Anne Colleton and her cowardly servant Scipio. But he is at his best when dealing with the defeated: Canadian Farmer Arthur McGregor, who becomes an embittered monster, recoiling at nothing to gain revenge; and one-time C.S. bigot Reggie Bartlett, who actually becomes a better man -no small feat in wartime- as he learns to give blacks a measure of respect. The author's minor literary offenses are not enough to detract from the general quality of the series. But there are too many repetitions, for instance: We don't need to read fifty times that taking Winnipeg from Canada will split that country in two. One reference to &quot;black-bordered casualty lists&quot; in daily newspapers is more than enough. And every family in North America seems to eat chicken stew for dinner, every evening!The major question, as we consider Turtledove's hard, and impoverished world, becomes this: How realistic is his theory in the first place?Turtledove willingly challenges one of the strongest tenets of International Relations Theory: that democracies trade with each other and don't wage war on one another. Would the US so willingly have turned its cannons on France and Britain?Even if the CSA had won the Civil War, would Britain and France so willingly have allied with a slave-holding nation? Would public opinion in either of these countries have stood for this, and for post-1882 apartheid in the American South? Would the United States so willingly become the pupil of Imperial Germany, a nation with doubtful democratic credentials at best?Turtledove's highly entertaining series is a must for anyone with the curiosity to ask &quot;what if..&quot; But it may be no more than that: Great entertainment...",

I enjoy the whole concept of an alternative WWI with North vs South, but I couldn't help but be disappointed while I was reading and when I was finished.For one thing, Mr. Turtledove has an annoying habit of making the same point over and over with many of his characters. I'm not talking about re-establishing them for this book for those readers who may not have read the early books in the series. I'm saying that he often replays the same scenario every time he comes back to a character within THIS book, sometimes without really advancing the plot or telling us anything new. Seems like wasted verbiage to me. I keep thinking about the newspaper comic strip &quot;Family Circus&quot;, which is basically five or so concepts repeated over and over with minor variations. I would have preferred for some of these scenes to be combined in order to cut back on the tedious repetition of explanation about a character's motivations.Another gripe: There is very little about events in the rest of the world. I would have enjoyed considerably more detail about the war in Europe and elsewhere. Turtledove has a great imagination and could easily have tossed in some interesting speculation.Nevertheless, it's a good read, and I would recommend it to anyone who has even the slightest interest in alternative history. And, yes, I'll undoubtedly snap up the final volume as soon as it comes out.",

Although 'Walk' was a lot better I was worried that Turtledove was missing out on some great ideas with regaurds to the way the European war progressed and also the political aspects of the war in the two Americas. But I am happy to say that the new book in the series, 'Breakthroughs,' addresses these aspects of the war in a wonderful and satisfying way. As the war continues, new tactics are employed that allow the U.S. to force her enemies to seek peace- but that's just the beginning of the troubles that lie ahead, troubles that both Yankees and Rebs simply aren't prepared for. In the north the U.S. must learn to integrate it's hard-won conquests into the union, in the south confederates stuggle to adjust to humiliation and defeat and turtledove even gives a character with disturbing parrellels to Adolf Hitler during his time in the trenches. Far and away the best of the series so far (excluding 'How Few Remain') this is a fun romp through what might have been. Turtldove is once again on top of his game!",

                "review/text": "The Great War series has been excellent, and this is undoubtedly the best so far! The pace of the action picks _way_ up, and doesn't slow down till the end.I haven't reviewed the previous two books, so I'll start with a few words about the series in general, for the benefit of those who haven't read them. It is set in the same world as Turtledove's earlier (and highly recommended) &quot;How Few Remain&quot;. In this world, the Confederates won the battle of Antietam, and went on to secede from the Union with help from Britain and France. The first book (&quot;The Great War: American Front&quot;) opens up in 1914 with the beginning of World War I. The war in Europe goes much as it did in real life, with Britain, France, and Russia squaring off against Germany and Austro-Hungary. At this point, however, things get more complicated. The CSA is quick to join the war on the side of its old friends, Britain and France. The US is equally quick to join the war on the side of its one European ally, Germany. The result is a bloody, grinding trench war along the US-Confederate and US-Canadian borders, accompanied by battles between the US and British Pacific fleets. Like the real WWI, the result is slow, gory, and not terribly decisive. It is tense and well told, but not much land changes hands.In &quot;The Great War: Breakthroughs&quot;, this changes very quickly. What has long been a war of positions makes the slow but inexorable transformation into a war of mobility.Throughout the series, many new tactics and technologies have been introduced. In this volume, they really begin to pay off. The result is some of the fastest, most exciting military-SF action to be found this year. Airplanes drop increasingly deadly and accurate payloads of bombs, wreaking destruction on both civilian and military targets. The US and it's Latin American allies launch an assault against vital supply lines in the Pacific, hoping to starve Britain into submission. Confederate submarines struggle to break the US Navy through hit-and-run tactics. Artillerymen concoct increasingly nasty chemical weapons. General George Armstrong Custer, long thought useless, finally does some good with his innovative use of barrels (tanks).The result of all this: soldiers are no longer safe in their own trenches, and war will never be the same again. The viewpoint characters must learn to live with this rapidly changing world. As artillery shells fall on Washington, DC, Nellie Semphroch quickly learns that obnoxious men are no longer her biggest concern. Gordon McSweeney, solidly religious but thoroughly bloodthirsty, delivers the Fires of Heaven to the Confederate heathens through the barrel of a flamethrower. George Enos hunts Confederate subs from the deck of the USS Ericsson. Jake Featherston, a stalwart Southern nationalist, turns his battery of howitzers on any who would dare hinder the Confederate war effort. The end result: one whopper of a read! The action never stops, and there's also a decent supply of nasty politics. Since book one, I've been anxiously awaiting the conclusion. The wait is almost up! I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say that the war is over by the end of the book (I won't say who wins). I guess book IV will deal with an alternate Treaty of Versailles, which will surely make an interesting conclusion.I don't give books five stars very often, but this one deserves it for sheer entertainment power.",

I particularly like to keep up with various characters that he has developed rather nicely,such as Jake Featherston and Cinncinnatus. At times this book moves along rather well and some of the writing is paticularly inspired,but for the greater part of the book we are simply plodding along from one telegraphed situation to another. Not very satisfying;therefore--2 stars. I thought that the situation in which the CSA found itself in regards to armaments to be a bit odd,considering that their major ally, Great Britain, was one of the World's leading industrial powers...and a naval power! My conclusion regarding this particular &quot;installment&quot; in the neverending saga ,is that it is really a setup for a real doozer of a &quot;Second World War&quot;. The parallel of the CSA being disarmed and occupied,as was Germany at the end of &quot;real-time&quot; W.W.I,is a good teaser for history buffs.Of course the anger, resentment, and the loser's desire for revenge sets up the next war. I suspect that the next book in the series will really make this one an important cornerstone for future developments. The generally flat tone of this book was not very satisfying,but it did leave me wanting more. Overall,this book was a necessary evil in order to further bring Dr. Turtledove's alternate history timeline to completion. I look forward to the next volume with enthusiasm.",

I did have some problems with this book and the rest in the series. I always wanted to know what was happening in Europe so that I could see the difference between our world and this one. The only real glimpses we got were in the second book when Verdun fell to the Germans, which held out in our world, and when France and the UK threw in the towel. They mention that Germany created the Kingdom of Poland with land taken from the Russians and that Russia was in Revolution, but that was about it. As for the res though I really enjoyed this book. I found it very interesting the way Custer was very similar to George Patton in this book by wanting to mass his Barrels (Tanks) and some of his sayings were almost direct quotes of Patton. I was surprised at how easily Turtledove has killed some of his major charecters in all three of these books. I was glad to see some go but also sad to see others go. Of course I was cheering for the American-German alliance throughout these books. I think it was east to tell that they were winning the war by the end of the second book. I would have liked to have seen all of the CSA and Canada occupied by the USA and all of France by Imperial Germany but I was glad to see them win. I can see possibilities unfold in the future for the universe and that's part of the reason I enjoy Alternate History and especially Hary Turtledove. It can open your mind to speculating what could have happened. Overall I think this book was very enjoyable. I don't think it was as well written as the others and I was disapointed by how many charecters he killed, but that added to the suprise factor. I am eagerly awaiting the final book in this series as I am awaiting all of Turtledove's books.",

The peace treaty imposed on the Confederacy is obviously modelled on the Treaty of Versailles -- and has an even greater potential for cheating. Politically, of course, a victorious Germany on the Continent has profound implications for the future. As in our history, armored breakthroughs end the stalemate of trench warfare. Here the idea comes from an unlikely source: George Armstrong Custer, whose single notable quality, for good or ill, is aggressiveness. A noted variation from our timeline is an earlier linkage of air power with naval power.But the real attraction of the book is to find out what happens to the characters we've followed in earlier books. Some benefit in unexpected ways from war. Some suffer. And some don't survive the war. Some carry on the fight after the armistice, and others begin to prepare for what they believe will be another war between the United States and the Confederacy.The most interesting development is that one embittered Confederate veteran seems on his way to becoming a Hitlerian figure in the series' future.",

Political maneuvering by our favorite Socialist Congresswoman Flora Hamburger. Actual insight into the psyche of our Canadian friends to the north. Finally an overseas plot involving South America and info on how the war really fares in forgotten Europe and Asia. A murder mystery plot resolved with a shock. As well as the tugging of emotions with a few surprise deaths of long-running characters, some will make you cry, others will make you smile in triumph. The only little nit I have is with the continued treatment of Covington, Kentucky in the Cincinnatus plot as a racist Confederate hotbed. I live right next to the city and know it's history.

In this book, he has basically turned the CSA into the Germany of 1917-1919 that we know. A breakthrough that cannot be plugged up allows an enemy to penetrate deep into the countryside, forcing an armistice. The currency is devaluated, and the disgruntled army is still semi-mobilized waiting to avenge themselves. (If you replace Featherston with Hitler, &quot;Over Open Sights&quot; with &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, and the Richmond War Department with Munich Beer Hall and jump ahead approximately 5-10 years, then the last few chapters make more sense.) It is rather evident what the sequel will bring: Jake Featherston as a Hitler-type leader of the CSA, bringing a holocaust on the blacks as &quot;backstabbers&quot; of the Confederacy, with another minor character (probably someone from this series-Major Potter or Jeff Pinkard?)as his Himmler. In the USA, Irving Morrell will have evolved into an advocate of armored warfare, maybe one of the British desert war generals?? However, I must say that Dr. Turtledove's style is intriguing and I can't wait to read his conclusion, especially what he will do with the European situation and where he will place the Battle of Britain.",

Now the war is over and the peace remains to be hashed out. The questions linger what kind of peace will there be ? That is what the great thing about this book was, it raised more disturbing questions, while the simple questions were progressively answered through the book.The clean, yet tragic, war was ending and a new ugly kind of warfare was being born. War was being fomented on the streets, before the peace had been settled. Turtledove has nicely woven these complex questions into this book, which is definitely the climactic moment of The Great War series. I must agree with some of the other reviewers about the unnecessry sex scenes which only detract from the serious reading.Nonetheless, I would enthusiastically recommend the book to any fan of history/ alternative history. The book is fast paced and there are many surprises in the book as multiple great characters fall. The next book, which I eagerly anticipate, will further outline the face of the peace to be imposed by the victors. It will explore the themes of hatred, bigotry and sense of betrayal in the CSA which will surely result in another war, a nasty, brutal and merciless war.

The students (who appear to have been company- and field-grade officers) had a remarkable grasp of how World War II would work out, foreseeing for example a sneak attack by the Japanese, the early loss of the Philippines, a &quot;Germany first&quot; strategy on the part of the western allies, and a cautious island-hopping retaking of the Pacific by the U.S. Understandably, they did not take such leaps as the possibility that Germany might over-run France in a few weeks, or that the development of carrier warfare might make the climatic naval battle (expected by both the U.S. and Japanese navies) an impossibility. Gole's point, as I understand it, is that by playing these annual games, a third-rate army (the U.S. Army had fewer than 200,000 men in the late 1930s) was able to leverage its officer corps into a cadre that could command an army ten times as large, and that was therefore ready to wage and win a global war.

                "review/text": "In the 1930s, as now, democracy was under attack from the Left and the Right. In the 1930s, as now, public opinion -- or at least the noisiest part of it -- was almost unanimous in announcing that democracy and liberty had to take a backseat to collectivity, appeasement and vapid appeals to a human nature better than any hitherto observed.Luckily, at least in the '30s, there were a few grownups with a realistic view of the world. They numbered hundreds and mostly worked in obscurity, while tens of thousands of enemies of democracy filled Madison Square Garden and called them militarists.So some of them were, as Henry Goles details in \"The Road to Rainbow.\"If not for the resonance with current events, this book would be pretty much inside baseball. Now, it's hot as a poker.In military planning, the United States was guided by isolationism and fear of entangling alliances, and up to 1934, hypothetical war planning had always assumed a single opponent. Each country was given a color -- thus Plan Orange for war with Japan, Plan Black for Germany. (The USA was Blue.)In 1941, the United States found itself simultaneously at war with a host of aggressor states, and it fought against them under a strategic plan called Rainbow. Historians, even those who worked for the Army, have often assumed that Rainbow was developed in haste.Not so, says Goles, who is the first historian to go through the student papers of the Army War College, which lay ignored in a basement for decades.He discovered that starting in 1934, the Army War College always set its problems as wars fought in \"participation with Allies,\" and in most years, against coalitions of foes.The studies made by these students showed a deep understanding of world events -- much deeper than those of the appeasers and antidemocrats -- and the factual and intelligence material they gathered was not merely academic. When the fighting started, national war planners had this mass of information already at hand.Furthermore, Goles shows that the college worked hand in glove with the Wars Plans Division of the Army General Staff. In fact, WPD or the chief of staff of the Army usually directed the college commandant to what it thought needed attention that year.It was commonly said in the 1930s that the democracies could not match up with the corporatist or collectivist polities, which were hailed as the future of mankind. Democracy, it turned out, had more brains than its foes, and when it came to putting the systems to the test, the antidemocratic forces made far more and worse strategic mistakes than the Allies.The realistic prewar planning helped bring this about.It was a close encounter. Thanks to the refusal of the peace faction to provide either men or munitions for defense, in the first two years of the war a lot of outnumbered, outgunned young men were maimed and killed.\"The army,\" Goles writes, \"was resource poor in an isolationist country, but it invested its limited resources and energy in education, training, studies and planning.\"He adds, in a statement that can be read both as he means it and in a totally opposite sense, \"There is something surreal in a third-rate military thinking first-rate global schemes.\"He means the United States, but the same idea applies, with different outcomes, to the Japans and Italys and Germanys of that time -- and to the Irans and North Koreas of the early 21st century.",

                "review/text": "Some students of war may find this book difficult only if they have a rudimentary background of the inter-war period. On the contrary, if you have read the Army &quot;Green Book Series&quot; you may find it diificult to tell where Army War College Students analysis of the future events begin and actual events of the period 1939 thru 1945 are now known history. Accordingly, this book should be a companion book to &quot;Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare, 1941-1942&quot;, United States Army in WW II, by Maurice Matloff; and &quot;Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare, 1943-1944&quot;, United States Army in WW II, by Maurice Matloff and Edwin Snell.With the benefit of new found material,this book brings to light the amount of real effort and &quot;Spade Work&quot; that went into the several war plans that are known as the Rainbow Plans. These student officers broke new ground in attempting to gel a &quot;Jointness&quot; into war planning and are much more astute in there geo-political-military analysis than previously written history acknowledges. Additionally, as successive classes have the benefit of the previous years work, coupled with events as they transpire, the predictions and recommendations for the conduct of the war were startingly accurate. For example Chapters 5 and 6 are a discussion of student war planning activity in 1936 and 1937, read and then compare those two chapters with actual events thst occured in 1939/40.Of wider significance is the fact that this book debuncts, with specific primary sources, both the specified and implied myth that war planning just sort of materialized in 1940-41 and had been done entirely in a vacuum without consideration of &quot;joint operations&quot;, or the wider political-military impact, not true; certainly there where huge silo's, but the students and subsequent war plans staff recognized many significant pearls of wisdom that resulted in both the student analysis and the wide question and evaluation process of the student methodolgy. A review of the appendix's, especially Appendix A and B, is revealing on the number of graduate students that served in high level staff positions. It is unequivocal that the plans implemented in 1941 to 1945 had there incubus in 1934.The real beauty of the book is that each chapter can stand alone. if you want them to. You can study the new chapters and compare the results against each of the chapters in the two companion references that I mentioned.All in all, this is a highly illuminating book, must read book, that brings a fresh approach to US Army Officer competance and vindicates the idea that we were totally unprepared for war. Perhaps in many other others yes, but not in the planning phase prior to our involvement.",

                "review/text": "This excellent book continues the approach to warfare taken by the authors in their outstanding three-volume edited series: &quot;Military Effectiveness&quot; published about a decade ago. That book looked at the First World War and the Second World War (including the interwar period) from the standpoint of each participating nation. It set up the standard of &quot;military effectiveness&quot;, taken at the levels of grand strategy/national policy (to include industrial and economic preparation) strategy (operational war plans) and battlefield performance (operational or theater level of war and tactics of divisions to brigades). They have applied this thorough and enlightening analysis to the present volume. This focus makes for an excellent &quot;operational history&quot; of the war. The emphasis is on the work of armies, corps and divisions in theater-level operations, as opposed to the tales of derring-do at the company or platoon level. However, one gets a good sense of the plight of the men at the point of contact. The field commanders are thoroughly and fairly assessed. Montgomery, for example, is given his due as a great planner and a great leader of men, but a testy martinet when it came to inter-allied coordination. I would say that our British cousins would not find any Monty-bashing here. Rommel likewise is fairly handled. Guderian's halo is removed;his role as a &quot;good Nazi&quot; does not detract from his reputation as a hard-charger, but his brashness in dealing with his colleagues in other units is brought out.Throughout, there is a constant interplay between the pre-war plans and preparations with the results of each operation. National temperament and command styles are neatly summarized.There is no waste of words. The text is gripping, concise and lively. There are no anecdotal asides --- one gets the impression that these two are writing from accumulated expertise over a long period rather than from note cards with colorful &quot;filler&quot; spliced in-- a fault of too many World War II books of late.Appendices on military organization, weapons systems, the art of war and the documentary sources are mini-encyclopedia in themselves.This book is indeed the definitive book on how the &quot;war to be won&quot; was, in fact, won by the allies and lost by the Axis.Highly recommended for both the knowledgeable buff and the novice.",

                "review/text": "This is an amazing product by two of this country's most prolific military historians. Millett and Murray have teamed together before as teachers, lecturers and authors, but this is their finest hour. More than 600 pages, a dozen well crafted maps and 64 photographs are employed to produce a stunning operational narrative of this century's bloodiest and most deadly conflict. From the early days of the war in Europe to the final blasts in Japan, this duo combines their 50 years of teaching experience and punchy prose into a highly readable, entertaining and educating package. Nowhere will the reader find a better combination of sweeping coverage and sharp conclusions about all the Second World War's major campaigns and operations. Furthermore, nowhere will the reader find the striking and damning conclusions the author's lay at the feet of Generals Bradley and Clark, as well as the pithy and well earned barbs directed at Field Marshal Montgomery. This tightly composed volume is now and will be the best single volume operational history ever written on WWII. It will quickly displace the work of John Keegan and Gerhard Weinberg, and rightfully so. It will be enjoyed by veterans of the war, students of history, and all military professionals. Recent books by great historians like Stephen Ambrose have highlighted the human dimension of what the Greatest Generation was like and how they faced daunting demands of martial combat. In A War To Be Won you will find exactly what they faced and how it was done. Very few historians have the experience, breadth and tenacity to take on such a monumental history. This pair has done it and done it admirably. Their scholarship and insights will not be easily surpassed.",

As long as one has a bit of time on his or her hands, this is a useful and entertaining way to spend some quality time with yourself in the company of two excellent history writers. The book has an amazing scope, and like Gerhard Weinberg's &quot;A World At Arms&quot; has a mammoth and daunting job at hand to describe the total scope and kaleidoscope of activities contained under the rubric of the second world war.The authors here are much more forthcoming than was Weinhard in discussing specific battlefield details of particular engagements, and this adds to the book's considerable value and readability to history buffs like myself. I enjoy their liberal employment of relevant economic, technological, geographical and other factors in describing the whos, hows, whens, wheres and whys of specific struggles as well as in describing the nature of the overall socio-political aspects of the war. So, when they subsequently launch into discussing their uniquely constructed &quot;standards of military effectiveness&quot;, they add to its value by buttressing their findings with a wealth of different kinds of supporting data, information, and background that makes the total overview of the war much more understandable than it would be otherwise.The book does suffer from some minor drawbacks, such as the authors' obvious quarrel with the contributions and strategies of Douglas MacArthur, yet they are also suitably fastidious in pointing out his many contributions and effective tactics as well. This drawback is counterbalanced by an outstanding treatment covering the Nazi campaign against Russia, and the day to day details crammed into describing the ill-fated and terribly over-extended German occupation and troubles in Operation Barbarossa and in the subsequent crushing defeats at the hands of the Russian armies is worth the price of the book alone.In summary, I also believe their well-argued and documented take on the importance and lasting influence of the second world war is crucial in understanding all that followed in the balance of the 20th century to be well taken, and to be beyond reasonable dispute. In some respects (Such as level of detail regarding specific engagements) this is a better book than Weinberg's, and on other levels it falls short of his monumental work. Combined, the two books offer one an astounding and quite rich look at a war that we are just starting to appreciate in all of its amazing scope, ferocity, and consequence. This book should be required reading for anyone considering a career in 20th century history, or for all of us history nuts who just can't get enough of a great thing. Enjoy!",

                "review/text": "Williamson Murray and Allan R. Millett, two veteran American academic historians, are to be commended for producing this authoritative, one-volume military history of World War II. It is a wonderful achievement! Their book is nearly 600 pages long, and it would be impossible to address every issue in a brief, 1000-word review. I will, therefore, confine myself to the authors' treatment of the effectiveness of the United States' military operations, with the understanding that this is representative of the authors' approach to the broader issues and topics.According to the authors, &quot;World War II was a conflict of resources as well as ideologies.&quot; Virtually every reader is familiar with the ideological dimension, but Murray and Millett focus much attention on the war's political economy. One of the Americans' greatest contributions to the Allied effort was, when possible, to address military problems &quot;through their legendary productivity.&quot; The authors emphasize: &quot;So vast was American war production that the United States not only armed itself but shared its output with the other Allies.&quot; Murray and Millett write: &quot;Logistical superiority was crucial to the Allies' victory, and America's role as the `Arsenal of Democracy' made a crucial difference. Not only did the United States carry the burden of most of the naval campaign in the Pacific and an increasing load of the combat in Europe as the war progressed, but its Lend-Lease program was essential to the military operations of its allies and to the functioning of their wartime economies.&quot; There are numerous examples of the wartime application of American productivity. For instance, in 1940, over a year before the U.S. entered the war, it &quot;recognized that the German assault on world shipping posed a significant threat to its own strategic position,&quot; and the Americans' development of the Liberty ship - which was constructed in sections and then welded together - proved to be a mass-production concept that revolutionized shipbuilding.&quot; Similarly, in April 1942, when, the &quot;Navy was unprepared to handle the U-boat onslaught...for many reasons, including the fact that it had too few escorts,&quot; the United States embarked on a program to produce 60 escort vessels in 60 days, and when it achieved that goal, it announced another such program.&quot; According to Murray and Millett: &quot;A major dimension of the industrialization of warfare was the commitment to develop and deploy new weapons that would give one's armed forces distinct operational and tactical advantages over the enemy,&quot; and, of course, the design and construction of the atomic bomb by an international team of scientists remains one of the most remarkable scientific and technological achievements of all time. Examining the war with Japan is the best way to assess American military performance during World War II because only in the Pacific did the United States fully deploy every element of its air, ground, and naval forces. The Navy had years to plan for the virtually-inevitable war with Japan. According to the authors, however, it was not until after Pearl Harbor that the U. S. finally began preparing in earnest. Murray and Millet write that &quot;FDR simply stated the obvious&quot; when he declared that &quot;only American air-naval power could eventually roll back the Japanese from their Pacific outposts and liberate the conquered states of Southeast Asia and China.&quot; Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall &quot;worried about the diversion of army resources from Europe to the Pacific war,&quot; but even after the disaster at Pearl Harbor, according to the authors, the United States' &quot;Pacific Fleet retained much of its combat power, which would surge in 1943 with the arrival of battleships, carriers, and cruisers already being built, ships that would not be needed in the campaign against German submarines.&quot; Murray and Millett quote Admiral William F. Halsey's &quot;simple South Pacific guidance:&quot; &quot;Kill Japs! Then kill more Japs.&quot; The war against Japan was won with significant contributions from each of the services. The tide of the surface naval conflict began to turn in the late-spring 1942 with the Battle of Midway, which Murray and Millett characterize &quot;as not quite a Trafalgar but far from an indecisive Jutland.&quot; In addition, American submarines forced Japan's economic collapse by devastating its merchant marine. The army and marines dug out tenacious Japanese defenders from islands across the Pacific from late 1942 through the spring of 1945. And the air force's campaign against Japanese cities culminated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Notwithstanding the success of American arms, Murray and Millet are not reluctant to criticize, and their vignettes of some American commanders are brutal in their succinct candor: On General Douglas MacArthur: &quot;MacArthur's paranoia, lust for personal publicity, political ambition, structured and comfortable lifestyle, and hypochondria were well known in the army;&quot; General Mark Clark: &quot;Many of Clark's contemporaries believed he possessed one of the best minds in the U.S. Army. Others believed his character consisted of equal parts vanity and slipperiness;&quot; and General Omar Bradley: &quot;dour, unimaginative, and deeply jealous.&quot;The costs of World War II were staggering. Millions died in combat, and millions of civilians also perished. In financial terms, &quot;the United States spent almost $350 billion on its war effort.&quot; Nevertheless, according to Murray and Millett, World War II &quot;remains `the good war' in American historical imagination.&quot; There are many reasons for this. One is that the United States and its Allies fought and defeated enemies whose despicable ideology threatened every freedom that Americans enjoy. Another is that &quot;the United States emerged from World War II stronger in both absolute and relative terms than it was when it entered the war.&quot; Murray and Millett's concise and perceptive treatment of American operations during World War II is indicative of the consistent excellence of this book. I am certain that it will rapidly prove to be simply indispensable to professional historians and students, but I also recommend it without qualification to general readers who want to know more about military operations in the global conflict which established the United States as the world's greatest power.",

                "review/text": "From the first, the reader is treated to a newness in WWII historical narrative and interpretation -- how combatants planned, prepared, and delivered their military campaigns across the globe. The authors have superbly managed the complexities of modern warfare on a global scale, and they manage to include theaters and personalities that often are ignored -- such as the Austrialian campaign in the Dutch East Indies, the Indian-British campaign in the China-Burma-India theater and the never talked about plight of the First Panzer Army from the South Caucasus to Romania. Guderian, Rommel, Zhukov, Montgomery, and Patton of course get thorough treatment, as do MacArthur, Clark, Nimitz, and King. The focus is on the men who implemented (and in some cases developed on their own) national stratgy to fight the war.There are however, some drawbacks that may thwart the lay reader. On a few occasions, the double-authorship assumes a &quot;Jeckle and Hyde&quot; character with seemingly contradictory statements in the same chapter. Unless familiar with modern military lexicon, the reader might not understand the distinction between &quot;best battlefield commander&quot; (Rommel) and &quot;best operational commander&quot; (Zhukov). Likewise, the Battles of the Atlantic and the Airspace over the Reich are said to have &quot;been won&quot; in mid 1942, yet in 1943 in both cases the authors state the issues were in doubt, and on occasion, the Germans getting the upperhand. Again, if the reader misses the distinction between victory in a campaign, and the remaining tactical engagements, he may be confused.Most annoying to me were editorial errors such as the &quot;four cruisers sunk at Midway (should be carriers), that Patton's Third Army was to the left of First Army (it was on the right, from the Allied perspective), and that General James Gain commanded the 82nd Airborne (ouch. James Gavin).Finally, on the minus side, there is an extreme dearth of citations for a 600 page work. Only direct quotes are annotated, and often the authors fail to back up controversial points with evidence in the narrative or by scholastic citation. This gives the work a &quot;journalistic&quot; flavor, which may appeal to those intent on reading, but for the researcher who wants to verify statements on atrocities or Nazi-Wehrmacht complicities, be prepared for disappointment.If nothing else, buy it for the pictures: over 100 famous and not so famous photos found in one volume (overlook the &quot;British sniper&quot; with a .45 Thompson). The appendices can stand alone. The trenchent analysis of the total cost of war can't be found anywhere else.In a single volume, no better value for the money.",

                "review/text": "Dr. Murray and I appreciate the favorable readers' commentary on our history of World War II, and we often benefit from readers' suggestions for correction and improvement as the book moves into additional printings. I am distressed, however, that Mr. Shahid Zaki has misrepresented to you, and in personal correspondence to me, my analysis of the national composition of General Slim's Fourteenth Army in Burma, 1944-45 (pp. 489-92). First of all, I characterize Slim's army as &quot;non-European&quot; and credit it with the defeat of &quot;the finest Asian army to take the field in modern times.&quot; I identify seven of Slim's twelve infantry divisions as part of the Indian Army, the force Mr. Zaki claims I slight. Mr. Zaki makes two errors in his commentary: (1) I do not say that the majority of Indian Army units were cavalry or armored regiments, but that among such mobile units in Slim's army, Indian Army units provided the majority. For the entire Indian Army, infantry predominated; (2) Mr. Zaki misses my other point, which was that Slim created a multi-national, multi-ethnic army that came to depend more and more on its Indian Army infantry battalions as the 1945 campaign developed. Initially, however, Slim created mixed infantry brigades that included one British battalion, one Gurkha battalion, and one Indian battalion. Unless one counts all the Gurkha battalions as Indian Army - which they were not - Indian Army infantry battalions were not in the majority when Slim's 1945 offensive began. Slim's two British divisions had sixteen European infantry battalions and three of other nationalities. His seven Indian Army divisions had nineteen British battalions, seventeen Gurkha Rifles battalions, and twenty-seven Indian Army battalions. One should add that Slim's most unappreciated force was two African divisions and an independent brigade, which provided twenty-one more non-European, but also non-Indian battalions. This calculation excludes General Orde Wingate's six-brigade (reinforced) Long Range Penetration Group, which included Gurkha but not Indian Army infantry battalions. Over the course of the 1945 campaign, General Slim placed increasing responsibility on his Indian Army infantry battalions as their combined arms, offensive capabilities improved. He could also draw Indian replacements or new battalions for his army, but not more British, Gurkhas, and Africans. Counting individual infantrymen (not battalions), I suspect Indians became the majority infantry nationality in Fourteenth Army by war's end. Nevertheless, Mr. Zaki is simply wrong when he claims &quot;that the Fourteenth Army in Burma was comprised mostly of combat units of the Indian Army.&quot; Mr. Zaki makes a common error of military history non-professionals, which is accepting commercial publications as infallible sources of statistical and order-of-battle data. You may be sure that Dr. Murray and I have learned this lesson the hard way, but we learned it -- or are still learning it. Even the official histories of World War II (every belligerent) should be read with care. In this case, my source of order-of-battle data was taken from Maj. Gen. S. Woodburn Kirby et al., _The War Against Japan_ (5 vols., Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1957-1969), Vols. IV and V, which I highly recommend. Any general history of as complex a human event as World War II is bound to have controversial interpretations and factual errors. My characterization of the Fourteenth Army may be one of the former, but it is certainly not one of the latter.",

They move from theater to theater with the skill of novelists; they eschew the weasel word &quot;Nazi&quot; unless they're actually talking about the German political system; and they deride the conventional wisdom about the ineffectiveness of the Anglo-American bombing campaign. (Germany had 10,000 flak cannon targeted against Allied bombers, compared to 8,200 against Russian tanks. How different the war in the east would have been, if those 10,000 guns and 500,000 Luftwaffe gunners and support personnel had been freed for the eastern front!)The commanders fare rather badly. The authors detest MacArthur (no surprise there) but are equally harsh on Bradley, Clark, and King. Montgomery gets mixed reviews, as does Rommell and the German high command, most of whom were thorough-going Nazis with little grasp of strategy. Indeed, the only place where the German military gets unreserved praise is for its mastery of &quot;combined arms&quot; on the battlefield. Time and again, Allied armies fight isolated battles against a weaker German force that prevails (or at least escapes) by virtue of the fact that air, armor, infantry, and artillery worked together, and this across the entire front.Japanese commanders get off more lightly--they accomplished so much with so little--but the brutality of the Japanese military still sickens after all these years. The same of course is true of the German military, and not just in the east. (Americans who get bent out of shape over the execution of Private Slovik should know that between 13,000 and 15,000 German soldiers were executed for subversion, desertion, or disobedience in the front lines--not to mention tens of thousands sent to near-certain death in penal battalions.) The difference really comes down to numbers: the Japanese murdered their captives by the hundreds of thousands, while the Germans murdered them by the millions. They were rogue nations, and God protect us from seeing their like again.&quot;A War To Be Won&quot; has errors and omissions, of course--no two men can get everything right with respect to the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century, if not all human history.

You learn what their assumptions were, why they designed the military they did, what their strengths and weaknesses were and how those interacted in the campaigns that decided whether Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan would dominate the world. This remarkable work reflects years of thought on the topic by Murray and Millett.They begin with this definitive description of the scale of the contest. &quot;World War II was the deadliest conflict in modern history. It continued World War I's slaughter of soldiers but then added direct attacks against civilians on a scale not seen in Europe since the 'Thirty Years' War three centuries earlier.&quot; (page vii)Murray and Millett render judgment on some very interesting topics. They are vehement about the culpability of the senior British officers in refusing to promote armored specialists to command armored divisions and blame Alan Brooke and his colleagues for refusing to learn the lessons of the first years of the war and refusing to open their senior ranks to people who were capable of the speed and complexity of modern warfare but not part of the inner clique. Murray and Millett admire Eisenhower and Patton but are the harshest critics of Bradley that I have encountered.The harshest condemnation comes for the German inability to believe their codes could be compromised or their intelligence service could be fooled. Murray and Millett note that the Soviet use of Maskirova (denial and deception) was consistently successful throughout the war once the fronts had been stabilized in December 1941. Again and again and yet again the Germans were surprised by Soviet offensives.This is an impressive overview that any serious student of warfare should carefully read. For the interested citizen this is as good a one-volume introduction to the military side of the Second World War as you will find.",

I understand the major players both politically and militarily and appreciate the book identifying who was in command of certain armies and whatnot, but it gets a little bogged down when the author says it was the 82nd regiment of the third army in wherever. Again, I know that is important to military buffs, but to the average reader it makes it hard to follow. Especially when multiple units from both sides are being listed and then it says how they moved across what terrain and whatnot. The author could have made it a little easier to understand with a few fewer details and I think the gist of the story would have been stronger and easier to understand.One thing I did like about the book was the way in which it covered the war as two separate theaters. I also liked the fact that it covered the aspects of the war in sections. It would have been WAY too difficult to follow if naval campaigns were tied in with air campaigns and land campaigns just for the sake of chronological awareness.The big question I had the whole way through by the way was, who did a good job strategically during this war. It seemed like every move made could have been better according to the author. The bombing campaign crippled Germany at the cost of a lot of personnel and equipment true, but it did really effect the outcome. And, the battle for the Phillipines was an Allied victory, but in this book it was portrayed as almost a victory that wasn't worth the cost. To me, the authors editorialized things a bit much.It did help to describe some of the generals and major military leaders, although I noticed Patton got a better review than I had read before. And, Omar Bradley wasn't as well thought of as I read in other books. Also Halsey wasn't as revered. I knew McArthur would get slammed though and probably rightfully so although a career Army guy might say otherwise.This book was good, but if you are worried about a less detailed, more political view of WWII there are probably better choices.",

                "review/text": "As the generation that lived it fades from view, the memories must not pass as well. The events that led to the only true worldwide war are almost unknown among the younger generation. While they do cover the events of the war in their classes, the incremental incidents that paved the way are often ignored. It took several years of piecemeal surrender and manipulation before the war became a truly hot one. Most of the history of the last half century cannot be understood without this knowledge. Nearly one fourth of the book is devoted to this topic, with many significant events highlighted. The most telling quote is one from Adolf Hitler immediately after the surrender at Munich, \"I saw my enemies at Munich and they are worms.\"As one who is fascinated by the events that led to this conflagration, the most impressive parts of this book are the honesty of the presentation. Some may argue that the war in the Pacific is cast in a secondary light, which is true and that this is a flaw in the book, which is wrong. Despite the importance of the Pacific theater, Germany in conjunction with her allies of Austria, Italy, Finland, Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria was by far the stronger foe. In reality, the war was won on the snow swept plains of Western Russia. It was there that the overwhelming majority of battle casualties occurred and the mighty German army was reduced to a shell. If it were not for this, the allies could not have successfully invaded North Africa, much less Western Europe.Events such as the \"success\" of the evacuation at Dunkirk are also placed in their true context. A rout led to the evacuation and nearly all of their equipment and ammunition was abandoned, only to be used by the Germans against their other foes. Furthermore, had the order to halt not been given to the Germans, few of the British troops would have been retrieved.Another point where the author stays on task is in the section on the use of atomic bombs against Japan. After over fifty years, it is easy to argue that the bombs should not have been used. This point is not addressed from either perspective, as the author sticks to the facts which led to the decision.Although it took many years and events to make it happen, the six years where the second world war was global were the most significant of this century. Lessons concerning international relations and nuclear politics were learned then and still shape how nations interact with each other. However, it is more important that we all remember what happened in those years and this book will teach you all the basics in a clear and concise way.",

Going into this book I knew little of the subject besides the few key events like Pearl Harbor, D-Day, Hiroshima, Hitler, but after reading this book I can realize a larger whole and where these events fit and many more things that went on. Also the book begins with a brief overview of World War One, which is essential to know in order to understand World War Two. I cannot believe what happened in this war and in this modern age.The only complaints I have are that because it's an Idiot's Guide book the tone is sometimes a little too comfortable with the little side notes and anecdotes, but still the author does a good job of not letting the tone get too too casual. The one other thing is that I wish that it had better maps. There are a small number mixed into the chapters, but they are not too detailed. I found myself consulting my own maps.

        "description": "From the ashes of World War II to the conflict over Iraq, William Hitchcock examines the miraculous transformation of Europe from a deeply fractured land to a continent striving for stability, tolerance, democracy, and prosperity. Exploring the role of Cold War politics in Europe's peace settlement and the half century that followed, Hitchcock reveals how leaders such as Charles de Gaulle, Willy Brandt, and Margaret Thatcher balanced their nations' interests against the demands of the reigning superpowers, leading to great strides in economic and political unity. He re-creates Europeans' struggles with their troubling legacy of racial, ethnic, and national antagonism, and shows that while divisions persist, Europe stands on the threshold of changes that may profoundly shape the future of world affairs.",

                "review/text": "When Chester Wilmot, an Oxbridge graduate and a reporter for an English newspaper, was sifting through the war records at Nuremburg during the war trials, it donned on him that all the material the Allies needed to determine whether their D-Day strategy worked was in his hands. When he became a don at Oxford (I believe), he did just that. He poured over signal records captured from the Germans, historical data from the Allies, and produced a marvelous account of what the Allies did on D-Day and why it worked. The fact that Wilmot was on foot as a correspondent with the first British landing parties on D-Day only adds to the vision and understanding in, and the reader's appreciation of, this story. You'll end up wanting more. My wife and I visited Normandy on an excursion in the Summer of 1994, one week to the day after the 50th D-Day anniversary stuff ended. The crowds were gone but all the sites and history were still there. We stayed in a chateaux in a village called Audrieu and, in preparation for the trip, wanted to read a D-Day history. I'd read the Longest Day and seen the movie, but wanted something more and different. A colleague merely remarked, flatly, &quot;it's the *best* book ever written on the subject.&quot; Wilmot didn't fail me. His ability to describe the macro troop movements and supply considerations, while at the same time describing in some cases every turn in the road, every hiding spot, and every skirmish, proved to me his ability as a great story-teller and historian. Even my wife, who was on the trip only because it was to France, and who originally had little interest in the region or D-Day, was smitten by the descriptions. She picked up the book while I was swimming in the Chateaux's pool early one morning, and it couldn't be pried loose until she was done. My wife was struck by the uncanny ability of Wilmot to describe a location or a battle or a situation from a hilltop, or vista point - along with a reference to a mile marker or other memorial so today's reader may find the same view, and witness what it is Wilmot is talking about. When one does this, as we did frequently, the book comes alive in the reader's hands more than any other first person history I have read. Wilmot's book is a masterpiece. Americans will read it and enjoy it because of its slightly skewed view for all of us - it's written from the British perspective most decidedly - and is unyielding in its frank comparisons of fresh but unskilled American troops, compared with their experienced, weary British colleagues. The book will stand out as an icon of its genre to anyone who reads it - and to those who accompany the tome to Normandy, it will make for a lifelong memory. Its ability to enhance a journey to Normandy cannot be overstated. Copyright TAStone 1997.",

Wilmot covers all of the war in Europe, including Dunkirk, Dieppe, Battle of/Invasion of Britain,etc but is especially in his element post D-Day. He puts a lot of things in context- e.g. land force successes are related to the strategic ability of Germany to wage war following the strategic bombing of German factories etc., which in turn is put into the context of an air war, and other factors pertaining to output. Yes, German output of materi&eacute;l was increasing at the end of the war...For me, the best thing is that Chester WIlmot was, I believe, a New Zealander. He is therefore a lot more objective in his work than you find in many of the distorted and jignoistic books on the topic, where you expect John Wayne to arrive at any minute and nothing goes wrong. The Allies DID make mistakes. It wasnt all glorious, and he reflects this, whilst giving credit where it is due and putting reverses into proper context. For example, his analysis of Omaha beach and the inadequacies of US higher command that led to it is very moving; and he pulls no punches with e.g. Operation Market Garden either. Further, the political struggles within the allies are as well represented as the struggle against Nazi Germany itself: Finally, after reading Wilmot, you are left in no doubt that the fighting in Western Europe after D-Day was every bit as bitter and devastating as the fighting in the first world war, and with equally horrific casualties.A must have book. I have been trying to track one down for years. I eventually found a well-used 1950s copy in a second hand book shop, and I would love another hard back version, but will settle for a paperback in the interim.BUY THIS BOOK!!",

                "review/text": "Chester Wilmot was uniquely qualified to write this exhaustive history. He was a war correspondent who made the jump on June 6, so in some ways his narrative of D-Day's opening is a memoir, a trained historian and an exhaustive researcher. This book occupied him for six years and even though it was published in 1952, it was and still is, a remarkably objective history of the war in Europe.First, the flaws. It's not complete. There's no account on the fall of France or Poland or Norway for that matter. It opens when the Germans have the BEF trapped in the channel ports in May 1940. But this is understandable. Wilmot's assertion that Hitler's letting the BEF get away sowed the the seeds for it's eventual return to the continent. Second, the Russian Front (which actually WON the war in Europe by the way) is dealt with only summarily and the Pacific is only discussed in terms of overall Grand Strategy. He also only mentions the war in the Mediterranean in passing. His Cold War conclusions were off as well, but this is said of course with hindsight. But considering when this was published (1952 originally), it's understandable for Wilmot for feeling that way.The strengths of this book is that if you want a first rate narrative of the whats, the hows and the whys on how the War in Western Europe was fought, then this is the book.Wilmot covers every possible aspect of the Western European campaign. From grand strategy, to desperate battles to blunders committed on both sides.American readers might be peeved the way Wilmot praises Montgomery and not enough flattering comments are given Eisenhower and Patton (though both do receive their share). Frankly, I think it's high time Monty gets some good recognition over here. You don't become a Field Marshal in any Army by being incompetent. He was a good general, maybe even a great one. He gave the British Army its first real victory over the Germans, something no other British general had yet to do.Wilmot also discusses the political machinations of both sides. The Allies were far superior to Hitler when it came to this. Also he discusses the economics of the war; something few if any military historians did at the time. Today, it's a common practice, but in 1952, it was a radical new approach.John Keegan's recommendation of this in his history of the Second World War got me to purchasing a copy. He still believes it's unsurpassed in many ways. I have to agree.I don't agree with everything Wilmot said, but I think that's what makes a good history book. You have points to debate and discuss. After all, history is always interpretive.",

It is from June 6th that this book really shines and shows the war in the west in a farily fine-grained manner.Wilmot, being an Australian, was somewhat baised and favorable in his treatment of MOnty. This aside, he does present an impartial treatment of the war in the west. As he was actually there (I believe), he had access to primary sources that make this a highly valuable and valid work. He doesn't glorify war or the allied efforts and the closing remark about the cost of war and hoping it never happens again is quite good.

                "review/text": "In this dense book the military history of the European theater of world war two is scrutinized with intricate detail. The history begins with the battle of Britain. The fall of Austria, Czechkoslovakia, Poland and France are all omitted. Germany's invasion plans, Operation: Sealion are what the reader is introduced with. The history continues with a detail scrutiny of the political, diplomatic and military moves (with an emphasis on the latter) that made up the struggle for Europe. The book ends with a history of the blunders at the Yalta conference and hints at the continuing tension that would mark post-war Europe.Why You Should Read This Book:Wilmot, in my humble opinion, gave an objective account of the war. He was not afraid to point out some of the blunders that the allies made in the course of the war. Some critics, Americans especially might disagree because he was highly critical of Patton and Eisenhower, while Montgomery was praised as a military genius. Indeed there might be some error by Wilmot in not giving an account of Chamberlain and his policy of appeasement. However this omission does not detract from the power of this history. This book gives the details to arguably the greatest conflict of mankind. With the generation that fought that war slowly dying away, it is important to revisit this war and not forget the lessons that history has taught us.What you should expect to see in this book:Expect a very detailed and at often times dry account of military plans, logistics, etc. The maps in here are of great use in understanding the war.What you should not expect to see in this book:This book is mainly a military history, so don't expect to read about the holocaust or about the Nazi philosophy. There are many good books on those subjects, but this is not one of them (I would highly suggest The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich by Shirer if you want to learn about the Nazis). Also, do not expect a lot of history before the battle of Britain. In addition this book was written at a time when information about the Eastern front mainly came from Nazi archives and not the Soviets. If you're looking for a book on Stalingrad or Kursk, this is probably not it (the author does cover these battles in detail, but modern books have been able to access more resources in describing them).I gave this book 4 stars because I only give 5 stars to masterpieces. This book is certainly a thumbs up.",

Of all the books about the second world war I read since, this work fulfil the thirst for knowledge I have regarding many aspects of that war, like logistic, war materiel production, and the effects of scientific discoveries on the outcome. The author writing is very fluid, not repetive in its description and straight forward. He doesnt hesitate to lay blames where due, and praises when warranted, neutral as he should be. I very much appreciate the battle situations maps, being in color they are easier to read and visualize the operation at hand. Appendix B: The High Commands is most useful when it comes to evaluate the reasons behind some of the crucial decisions that were taken. On the other hand, I find the author cursory writing about such momentous events as the North African and Italian campaings somewhat disconcerting, being much too short and lacking in depth, given the impact those campaings had on the german ressources. Seems obvious that the author was not prepared to go in more details, having probably not researched those two campaings to his satisfaction in order to elaborate further. One must remember, this book was first printed in 1952, not such a long time after the war.

It's a dry book but from the point of view of the battles and command structures it has probably got to be one of the best books on war that I've read. It's the sort of book that War Colleges would recommend for professional military students to study - professional, logical and perfectly representative of command, control and communications in major war. There are no personal vignettes, no rhetorical and ethical questioning of the meaning of war etc. The account of D-Day to the end of the war in the West is in itself a sobering exercise. However, if I could quibble it would be to point out that it should be entitled &quot;The Struggle for Western Europe&quot; and that on the land. The Eastern Front is almost entirely neglected, as is Italy, the sea war, the air war which were all contemporaneous with the land battle in the west. But this is a small failing with the grinding industrial quality which is the unfortunate fact of modern war. It doesn't stop to mourn the dead (that comes later) and nor does Chester Wilmot.

But in 1814, as attention moved from the northern frontier to the mid-Atlantic region, the Americans fought back and drove the invaders from the bay. Christopher T. George traces the abuses of the inhabitants of the Chesapeake Bay by Royal Navy raiding parties under arrogant Rear Admiral George Cockburn. Cockburn's burning and pillaging of bay communities preceded the burning of our nation's capital, Washington, D.C., on August 24-25, 1814, by Major General Robert Ross. Cockburn persuaded Ross that the Americans could not stand up to Lord Wellington's Peninsular War veterans. But he miscalculated when it came to attacking Baltimore, where citizen soldiers, strongly led by Revolutionary War veterans Generals Samuel Smith and John Stricker, and backed by U.S. Navy regulars, held the British at bay, killing Ross and reclaiming American pride.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

                "review/text": "The War of 1812 was a watershed for the United States; it was the first time we declared war on another nation. So, how did we do? For one, we gained recognition as a member of the world community. But more importantly, we relied on the militia to prosecute the war and learned some hard facts about their utility as a main defense force. This is the focus of Professor C. Edward Skeen. CITIZEN SOLDIERS seeks to describe the federal use of the militia to augment the regular army; survey the militia's performance in general; and review the operational aspects of militia participation at the state level (p. 1).The fifty-five delegates of the Constitutional Convention believed state governments should provide a counterbalance to the national government. State sovereignty and individual liberty were paramount when the time came to provide for the common defense. This resulted in the militia system of national defense, which had its flaws. Although the federal government provided for \"organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia\" during wartime and could mobilize state militias to \"execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions,\" states reserved the right to regulate the militia and appoint their own officers (p. 5). Thus, the federal government wrote the regulations for the militia while state governments regulated the militia.Six of the author's ten chapters are devoted to federal-state relations and the organization and mobilization of the militia. The other four chapters are the meat of the book; they evaluate the combat performance of the militia and support Skeen's main treatise: Although the minutemen fought well under the right circumstances, the War of 1812 proved that America could not rely on the militia to serve as its first line of defense.Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry bested the British on Lake Erie in 1813. This enabled General William Henry Harrison to destroy Tecumseh and break the back of the Indian confederacy. Skeen concludes that the outcome of these campaigns \"were attributable to the militia\" (p. 95), even if their record in combat was undistinguished.Meanwhile along the Niagara, General Peter B. Porter of New York rallied the militia and routed the British at Battle of Black Rock. Skeen singles out Porter as the quintessential militia leader of the war: \"[Porter] demonstrated persuasively that militiamen, capably led, were effective fighters\" (p. 107).Along the eastern seaboard, the Royal Navy sailed into Chesapeake Bay, put troops ashore at Benedict on 18 August, and invested Washington during the Battle of Bladensburg in 1814. According to Skeen, \"The Battle of Bladensburg represented probably the worst example of militia performance in the war. It illustrated in microcosm all of the things wrong with the militia in the War of 1812\" (p. 138). They were poorly organized and equipped and they lacked unit cohesion and leadership.The outnumbered British were opposed by 7,000 Americans led by Brigadier General William Winder, whose \"chief qualification [to command] was that he was a nephew of Levin Winder, governor of Maryland\" (p. 130). Although Winder's force was predominantly militia, which Winder himself blamed for the eventual outcome of the battle--it was the leadership, not the composition of the American force that led to their defeat. Simply put, Winder was incompetent.The British withdrew from Baltimore and the Chesapeake Bay area in September 1814 and shifted their focus to the southern theater along the Gulf of Mexico. Fortunately--for the sake of the militia--the militiamen in the South performed better than their brothers did along the eastern seaboard. Andrew Jackson's dramatic victory at New Orleans was the major battle in the Southern theater and the capstone of the War of 1812. Skeen believes Jackson's leadership of the militia \"showed once again that, under the right circumstances, given proper leadership, discipline, training, and arms and equipment, American militiamen were capable of fighting\" (p. 174).CITIZEN SOLDIERS is at its best refereeing the arguments over the militia between the states and the federal government. For example, the New England states believed their governors reserved the right to decide when the militia should be mobilized, not President James Madison. They questioned the federal government's declaration of war and balked at mobilizing their militia because, they claimed, the war was unconstitutional (pp. 65-72). In fact, many of the militiamen that did fight still refused to cross the Canadian border because they believed it \"unconstitutional.\"Unfortunately, CITIZEN SOLDIERS assumes a working knowledge of the War of 1812. Although Skeen gives enough coverage of each theater of operations to support his arguments, he does not offer enough depth for his book to stand alone as a history of the war.In closing, I don't think CITIZEN SOLDIERS has broken any new ground. Donald R. Hickey has already produced the definitive history of the war with his WAR OF 1812: A FORGOTTEN CONFLICT (Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1989). Likewise, John K. Mahon has already told us all there is to know about citizen soldiers and the militia with his HISTORY OF THE MILITIA AND THE NATIONAL GUARD (New York: Macmillan, 1983) and THE AMERICAN MILITIA: DECADE OF DECISION, 1789-1800 (Gainesville: University of Florida Press, 1960). Yet, thanks to a Herculean research effort, Citizen Soldiers is a winner. Skeen's endnotes and bibliographic essay evidence his extensive documentary research in state and federal archives. He has done well in marshalling evidence from primary and secondary sources and carries his main argument: \"[The War of 1812 showed that] the militia was an unreliable main defense force&quot; (p. 3).",

The War of 1812 happened a mere 25 years after the Constitution was drafted and debated. The federal government had been charged with &quot;organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia&quot; under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution had done what the Anti-federalists had feared (despite the Second Amendment guarantees) of ignoring the militia in favor of a standing federal military. The militia was poorly armed and did not know how to use the weapons they were provided. The professional soldiers could not tolerate the lack of disciplne of the militia. The problem is that the language of the Constitutional debates no longer is understood; however, the United States had to live with the institution of the militia as its first line of defence. The author more than suppports his main argument: &quot;[The War of 1812 showed that] the militia was an unreliable main defense force&quot; for the multitude of reasons. This book is less about militiary history and very useful for Constitutional scholars.",

                "review/text": "The book does what is says, but beware!At first I was very excited to see a book on the topic. It is generally interesting, but hard to read and unevenly researched. It is centered mostly on the southern states and nearly ignores actions along the coast north of Maryland. The book is a constant jab and bash at the militia system to the point of boredom. I don't believe anyone expected a militia system that trained 4 days a year to be anything but a speed bump to veteran British regiments. The system did what it was supposed to do and countered local raids and was the 'first' line of defense against invasion.The book spends alot of time on the political troubles of the system and explains it well in a somewhat chaotic manner. Many first hand sources are used, but sometimes takes the author to the same incorrect conclusion as others before him. Modern studies that discount old myths seem to be ignored.A couple of chapters that let me down were the 'Militia Organization' and 'The Atlantic Front..'. The first boils down to two paragraghs that give very general details of organization. I was shocked that artillery and cavalry were left out. No mention of the French military influence or the basics of 'standing militia', 'elite militia (lights, rifles, artillery and cavalry)' and 'volunteers'. The second chapters covers New England in two paragraphs that are poorly researched. Both are primary sources that are biased and inaccurate. Maine was actually invaded and occupied until well after the war with the intent to adding it to Canada. The New England states did not perform any better, however they were better organized and equipped than most.The militia battle in Stonington/New London, CT mentioned on p. 130. barely gets a paragraph, but a positve chapter would counter the book's theme.Sadly the author ignores the 'Laws of War' at that time which generally stated 'armed resistence of a city would forfeit it'. A key consideration for local militia and their homes and shops.The fault was not with the militia, most countries had such systems, it is that the US depended too much on it.",

        "Title": "1812 the war that forged a nation",
        "description": "In June 1812 the still-infant United States had the audacity to declare war on the British Empire. Fought between creaking sailing ships and armies often led by bumbling generals, the ensuing conflict featured a tit-for-tat \"You burned our capital, so we'll burn yours\" and a legendary battle unknowingly fought after the signing of a peace treaty. During the course of the war, the young American navy proved its mettle as the USS Constitution, \"Old Ironsides,\" sent two first-rate British frigates to the bottom, and a twenty-seven-year-old lieutenant named Oliver Hazard Perry hoisted a flag exhorting, \"Don't Give Up the Ship,\" and chased the British from Lake Erie. By 1814, however, the United States was no longer fighting for free trade, sailors' rights, and as much of Canada as it could grab, but for its very existence as a nation. With Washington in flames, only a valiant defense at Fort McHenry saved Baltimore from a similar fate. Here are the stories of commanding generals such as America's Henry \"Granny\" Dearborn, double-dealing James Wilkinson, and feisty Andrew Jackson, as well as Great Britain's gallant Sir Isaac Brock, overly cautious Sir George Prevost, and Rear Admiral George Cockburn, the man who put the torch to Washington. Here too are those inadvertently caught up in the war, from heroine farm wife Laura Secord, whom some call Canada's Paul Revere, to country doctor William Beanes, whose capture set the stage for Francis Scott Key to write \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" 1812: The War That Forged a Nation presents a sweeping narrative that emphasizes the struggle's importance to America's coming-of-age as a nation. Though frequently overlooked between the American Revolution and the Civil War, the War of 1812 did indeed span half a continent -- from Mackinac Island to New Orleans, and Lake Champlain to Horseshoe Bend -- and it paved the way for the conquest of the other half. During the War of 1812, the United States cast aside its cloak of colonial adolescence and -- with both humiliating and glorious moments -- found the fire that was to forge a nation.",

                "review/text": "1812: The War That Forged A Nation, by Walter R. Borneman, is a comprehensive, if somewhat superficial, look at the war that gave the United States a national identity, even as it ended in essentially a stalemate. Borneman is mostly known for history books dealing with the western United States, and he even mentions in his Acknowledgements how this book seems to be out of his field. However, Borneman maintains that the war set the United States on a course that would result in the western expansion that is his bread and butter, and thus deserves to be looked at more closely. It's a very interesting book that covers the entire war that tells everything that happened, though it doesn't quite go into as much detail as I would have liked.Borneman sets the stage for the war by discussing the relations between Great Britain and the United States in the first decade of the 1800s, including one of the main reasons for the United States to go to war: the impressments of American sailors into British naval service on the high seas. The United States was still considered an extremely minor power and was bullied by pretty much everybody. While the French didn't impress sailors, they did do other things, and some hawks in the American government actually advocated going to war with both Britain and France! One other reason for the war, not as popularly known, was that many westerners wanted to steal Canada out from under Great Britain while they were distracted by Napoleon on the continent. They didn't see any reason why Canada shouldn't be part of the United States, by force if necessary.Thus, the war drums were beaten, and war was declared. Borneman does a great job showing us all of the machinations that went on behind the scenes to get the declaration of war passed in Congress, along with a couple of incidents that almost got the war started before it really did. While this information is obviously well-known to history buffs who have studied the era, it was information that I hadn't known before and I liked how Borneman laid it all out for us. He shows how Madison went along with all of this, though he was almost hoping that Congress would bail him out of the course he had set for the country.Once the fighting starts, Borneman also explains all the battles that happened during the war, sometimes in very vivid detail. He tells us about the horribly executed three-pronged invasion of Canada that resulted in the loss of Detroit to the British, as well as the first major US victories on the high seas before the British finally started taking this upstart navy seriously. The level of detail is amazing sometimes, though for some reason I felt a bit removed from all of the action. I'm not sure if it's because he is sometimes unable to give reasons for what happened or if it's his style, but while the prose is detailed, I felt like something was missing. Perhaps it's because the book comes in two modes: detailed battle information and the reasons behind some of the events in the war, but these two modes never really mingle. Instead, we get some battle detail, then we get some \"big picture\" information, and then we go back to the battles, etc.I do have to give Borneman credit, however, for making a (for lack of a better word) \"boring\" war very interesting to read about. He has obviously done his research and he gives descriptions of tactics in each battle (including wonderfully rendered maps!). These descriptions make you feel like you are right there on the battlefield, hearing the explosions and feeling musket balls whistle past your ear. Sometimes his descriptions make it seem impossible that so few (relatively speaking, of course) men actually died in these battles. He describes men being mown down by rows of musket fire and then we hear casualties of 81 killed and 500 wounded or the like. Of note is his account of the Battle of New Orleans, a battle that was fought after the armistice had been signed but before news had reached the participants, and could have resulted in a resumption of hostilities if the British had won. This battle is even more lovingly described than the rest of them and he really shows Andrew Jackson's leadership and tactical expertise in this chapter.The War of 1812 was a war that some in the United States wanted for their own purposes, but one that almost to a man it was desperate to get out of as Napoleon surrenders and the British are able to concentrate on this annoying gnat of a country. Nothing was resolved officially, but it turns out to be the war that would cement the feeling of \"America\" on an infant country that was just trying to find its feet in the world. Borneman does a great job showing how this occurred, with Jackson's resounding victory of a battle-hardened British army being the final piece of the puzzle. While there may be more comprehensive books on the War of 1812 out there, 1812: The War that Forged a Nation is a wonderful starting point.David Roy",

                "review/text": "The War of 1812 is often passed over very quickly in American history class because it is supposedly neither very interesting nor important. Walter Borneman seems to have taken exception to this idea and has set about to show his readers just how interesting and important this war was. His writing style and his ability to guide the reader along through a maze of events and people in a clearly understandable way help him to accomplish his first goal. I think however, that he may have overreached on the importance of the war, at least when it comes to national unity.Borneman writes much like a novelist and his prose keeps the story of this conflict going in a quick paced and highly engaging manner. He is in fact, a little too conversational at times and although I did find this to be a little distracting it wasn't a big problem at all. The most amazing aspect of Mr. Borneman's writing style is that he manages to tie all of the action into the bigger picture with what appears to be very little effort. This is no small feat when one considers that this was a war that was pretty much divided into at least five separate little wars that were connected only tenuously to each other. Add to that the several Indian Nations involved, most of which sided with the British but not all, and one tribe that divided up and fought each other and one has the makings of a convoluted mess. Borneman somehow manages to tie it all together without getting his readers completely lost and on top of that he keeps it interesting. Not only interesting I might add, but fascinating.Borneman's main contention is that the War of 1812 made the United States into a confident and united nation. He proves his point about American confidence fairly well and also shows that this war gained a good deal of respect for the U.S. among the powers of the world. The Monroe Doctrine would surely not have been possible before 1812 for no European nation would have paid it any attention at all.On the other hand Mr. Borneman falls short in his argument about the new unity of the United States as a result of the war. One of the chief handicaps that hampered American plans during the war was that the states didn't work well with the Federal Government or with each other for that matter. State militia units were constantly refusing to cross out of their states or into Canada, and Vermont and New York farmers were selling tons of supplies to the British. While the outcome of the war did no doubt strengthen American unity somewhat, there was still a long way to go and no matter Mr. Borneman's claims, the United States remained a plural term for many of it's citizens for many years to come.While the author's main thesis is not all that well supported by this book this is still an excellent short history of the War of 1812. It is highly readable, easy to follow and solidly researched. There is little or no new scholarship to be found here but for anyone who has a limited knowledge of this era of American history I would highly recommend this book. I would also think that even a student of this time period might find out a few new things within these pages for Mr. Borneman has brought a fairly complicated subject to life and has given it a focus.",

                "review/text": "1812 is a riveting account of a dangerous time in our country's history. For a nation only 20 years of age, one whose economic health was so dependent on overseas commerce, to emback so impetuously in a war with the world's greatest maritime power--a power who nearly was succesful in stillbirthing the nations's inception--seems foolhardy at best. The justifiable goals of war: impressmant of U.S. citizens for duty on Her Majesty's ships, the equally unreasonable Orders in Council, that forced the world's seagoing traders to pay protection to the crown, was laudable. But the American rallying cry for Canadian lands today smacks of hypocrisy, given our colonial past, and Jefferson's embargos caused more financial pain --self-inflicted-- than any policy Great Britain had imposed.As with the Revolution, this war put our national life fully on the line. In 1812, grievances that might have been successfully addressed with patience and diplomacy in the end, through war, built a national character--a sense of collective state's self-- that indeed forged a union that made the coming civil dispute a two-party war and not chaos between 18? states.I knew none of this, appreciated none of the fragility of our fledgling union before reading this book. Borneman writes compellingly, conversationally, and has a tremendous capacity for building a broader context for events and personalities that ultimately makes sense for what might otherwise be a cocophany of battles, places and people. I highly recommend 1812 The War That Forged a Nation for anyone wanting to add depth to their picture of our nation's formative years. The book belongs on the same shelf as McCullough's John Adams, Ambrose's Lewis and Clark, and Franklin's biography.",

I had read Remini's biography of Andrew Jackson (which I strongly recommend), and found that I knew nearly nothing about the War. Unlike America's previous battles, this one was essentially dominated by our Navy.As a result, I searched long and hard for a book on the war but found that there hasn't been much scholarship devoted to it. I picked up Borneman's book without knowing anything about it, and it is OK. It introduces the main themes of the war, its major battles, and goes into SOME details, not a lot.But the problem isn't so much in the details - I actually preferred getting a good overview the war, rather than being bogged down with too many details -- the problem was with the writing style. Borneman wrote the bulk of the book as I expect he likely tells his children about the war -- it's very casual and cliched. At some points though, it seems as if though he tried hard to impress us with his writing ability and descriptive prowess, much like an amateur poet, by throwing in many different figures of speech, oftentimes in the same sentence, and it sends the style over the top.Overall, the book is a decent introduction to the war. If you know nothing about it, this book will give you a familiarity with the war and the major figures. Just ignore the style.",

                "review/text": "The War of 1812 proved a great trial for the young United States. Not only did it include an effective British blockade on American shipping -- especially in the last year of the war -- but the Embargo Act of 1807 passed in Jefferson's second term led to a 90% decline in American exports before the war ever started. Across the country, wharves and warehouses were piled high with American goods and foodstuffs with nowhere to go.Who really wanted the war in the first place? It wasn't New England: Even while U.S. forces were engaged fighting the British in Canada, New England farmers made a good business selling beef to the enemy. The government in Washington was angry that American ships were being boarded by British warships and having crew members taken off because they \"looked\" like British deserters. The South was worried because the British forbade shipping cotton to Napoleon's France or to any of the mainland European countries he now occupied.Primarily, however, it was the West, which in those days meant Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio, which wanted to fight. The very thought that the British could interdict shipping down the Mississippi to the Port of New Orleans was a threat to the very existence of the newest of the United States. Henry Clay bragged in Congress that he could take 300 Kentucky militiamen and conquer Canada.That was not to be. The war on the ground took place in four theaters. It was the attempt to take Canada that was perhaps the biggest failure. Several U.S. armies came to grief because of bad military leadership, the unwillingness of militias to cross a national boundary, the inability to take advantage of a military victory (as at Lundy's Lane), and various other causes typical of green and poorly led troops. In time, good military leaders did emerge, especially Winfield Scott, but by then the focus was gone from Canada.The only real victories -- up until the very end -- were at sea. The duels between Old Ironsides and the Guerriere and Java stunned the British Admiralty. At Put-in-Bay on Lake Erie, Oliver Hazard Perry bested a flotilla put together by the British; and Commodore McDonough did the same at Plattsburg, NY, on Lake Champlain.The other two war theaters were Chesapeake Bay, in which the U.S. capital at Washington was put to the torch and Fort McHenry was bombarded, though little else of note occurred, and New Orleans. The latter, the only decisive victory by U.S. ground troops over British regulars (who had fought in Spain against Napoleon) took place after the peace treaty of Ghent was signed, but before the news of the signing had reached American shores.Borneman does a creditable job retelling the events of the War and the events leading up to it, complete with maps, footnotes, a useful bibliography, and illustrations of the major players. His conclusion that the war led to a national consciousness coming into existence, whereas before Americans thought of themselves primarily as residents of their states, comes at the tail end of the book. I would have liked to see a more detailed discussion of his hypothesis.By and large, however, I enjoyed the book enough to want to look into Borneman's other work. There are relatively few contemporary works about the period, and this one does do justice to its subject matter.",

                "review/text": "Author Walter Borneman follows successfully in the footsteps of David McCullough and Stephen Ambrose in writing this highly readable, popular account of the War of 1812. Indeed, \"1812: The War That Forged A Nation\" is not only the best popular account I have read on this war, but is one of the finest popular histories on the early history of the United States I have encountered so far. To his credit, Borneman traces the origins of the war back to Aaron Burr's infamous conspiracy to create a new \"Western Empire\" in the frontier country of Ohio and the remainder of the Northwest Territory, and the desires of some Westerners eager to add Canada and Florida to the United States. Perhaps these, more so than British impressment of American sailors, were the root causes behind the War of 1812, which Borneman implies in the opening chapters of the book. And he reveals - at least to me - a hitherto unknown dimension of the war itself, noting how close both the United States Congress and President James Madison came to not declaring war against Great Britain. Once war is declared, Borneman does an elegant job describing all of the major campaigns in Canada and along the western and southern frontiers; he correctly notes the bravery of Canadians defending themselves from the American invaders as well as the gross incompetence of most American generals, with the notable exceptions of Brown, Scott, and especially, Jackson. He also makes a very persuasive case that the American victory at the Battle of Lake Champlain was the most important naval battle of the war, not the Battle of Lake Erie or any of the brilliant frigate duels won by the likes of Captains Hull and Decatur. He also provides sympathetic portrayals of British generals such as Brock and Ross during their respective campaigns in the Great Lakes and Maryland (And yet, I can't help but notice just how incompetent much of the British military - as well as American military - leadership was during the conduct of this war.). I found this splendid one volume history of the War of 1812 hard to put down.",

He definitely keeps you interested in the story throughout the book. You even find yourself at times hanging on at the end of a chapter as if you were reading a novel.This book has many unique features which places it above your average history book. For example, as the book progresses Mr. Borneman provides detailed background of all the major personalities involved in the war in a real Stephen King-like fashion which thus adds more depth and interest to the characters as the narration continues. Another entertaining facet of the book is that he is able to arrouse enough interest in the personalities so that you can easily follow their actions as the war progresses. It is rare that you find yourself looking back in the book because you forgot a name or couldn't follow the story.The only thing that prevents me from giving this book a 5 star rating is the few flaws that slightly mar the book. Granted they are forgiveable, nonetheless flaws are present. I doubt they will deter you from purchasing this book, but in case they are of concern, I feel it necessary to mention them. First of all I was disappointed with the quality of the maps. I have ready plenty of history books and one of the most interesting things you find in them is that they are replete with maps of major military campaigns and battles. This book was \"very\" sparce on them with the exception of some naval battles. Also I feel that the conclusion of the book was a little rushed and lacking. For instance, one of the key reasons for going to war was over sailor impressment. Yet the concluding remarks does little to enlighten the reader as to how this issue was resolved after the war. Perhaps Mr. Borneman may consider rewriting the concluding remarks of the book with more details. Otherwise by the end you feel you need to look in an encyclopedia after reading the book to answer some questions that are still on your mind.All in all I enjoyed the book. It was quite easy to read and I would highly recommend it for parents or teachers who are encouraging children and students to develop an interest in history. At the same time I would recommend it as highly to history buffs and thoughtful intellectuals.",

While reading the book, I did not (at first) get this impression, but his summary did indeed tie it all together nicely and helped me to understand why he makes this claim.Borneman's book gives us a good look at the war, including comprehensive sketches of some of the major engagements. There is no doubt that had the Americans failed to perform as admirably as they did on the ocean, the war would have been easily won by the British very early. Had the Americans performed better during the land battles, they could have easily knocked the British out of North America and won a handy victory in short order.In the end, the war turned out to be 3 years of brutal fighting on the North American continent; everywhere from Canada to New Orleans that did not appear to accomplish anything militarily, but it did indeed lead to the different sections of America (New England, the South, the West, etc.) to join together and become the United States of America.For anyone looking for a solid treatment of the war, I would highly recommend this book. I was quite pleased to read the book and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the military tactics of the war, the political reasonings behind the war, and the ultimate outcome.",

        "description": "This comprehensive and authoritative history of the War of 1812, thoroughly revised for the 200th anniversary of the historic conflict, is a myth-shattering study that will inform and entertain students, historians, and general readers alike. Donald R. Hickey explores the military, diplomatic, and domestic history of our second war with Great Britain, bringing the study up to date with recent scholarship on all aspects of the war, from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada. The newly expanded The War of 1812: A Forgotten Conflict, Bicentennial Edition includes additional information on the British forces, American Indians, and military operations such as the importance of logistics and the use and capabilities of weaponry. Hickey explains how the war promoted American nationalism and manifest destiny, stimulated peacetime defense spending, and enhanced America's reputation abroad. He also shows that the war sparked bloody conflicts between pro-war Republican and anti-war Federalist neighbors, dealt a crippling blow to American Indians, and solidified the United States's antipathy toward the British.",

For such a short book, Hickey does a remarkable job with covering the political, military and (most welcome to me) social climates of the early 19th century. We learn all about the early U.S. economy and how important it was to have the good trade relationship with England and France that we initially had and how the subsequent naval conflicts with these countries affected that commerce. The other issues that led to the initiation of war, that were so complex, are covered clearly and concisely (no easy task...other books on this subject delve into much unnecessary detail that only cloud the issue leading to much confusion). All the important strategy (on the English and Native Indian side as well as the U.S. side)and battles are woven into a well balanced account. Additionally, the maps that are provided only add to that understanding. The stunning events of Fort McHenry, the burning of the White House and Andrew Jackson's battle of New Orleans are given their proper due along with lesser known conflicts along both Lakes Erie and Ontario. Finally, the political maneuvering on the part of the U.S. delegation at Ghent get a &quot;to-the-point&quot; summary that clearly lets the reader know what all the issues were that ended the war. Hickey is not bashful about stating that this war was, at best, a draw and that the U.S. &quot;won&quot; by not losing and that the diplomats at Ghent were ultimately responsible. Overall, I'm sure that the long version of this book went into much more detail on the battles and diplomacy, but, for a summary, you won't find many accounts better.",

In part, as Hickey explains in this well organized, clearly written account, this is because the war was both indecisive and probably easily avoidable. In concise chapters, Hickey fills in the diplomatic and political background to the war, including the political divisions between the Republicans and the Federalists--and among the various factions of the Republicans; the military campaigns in the Northwest, Niagara, East, and Southwest, the naval encounters, the British attacks on Washington and Baltimore, and the triumph of Jackson at New Orleans;the \"inner war,\" especially the isolation of the Federalists and New England; and the Peace of Ghent and its ironic aftermath, as the Federalists were in large measure scorned even while their beliefs in the need for greater maritime security and internal taxation were vindicated. Along the way, Hickey highlights the frequent problems of supply, finance and morale (such as militiamen not wanting to cross the Canadian border in the middle of a campaign), the accomplishments of rising stars such as Winfield Scott, Oliver H. Perry, William Henry Harrison,and of course Francis Scott Key; the ineptitude of some American leaders (political and military); and the roles of various Indian tribes in the conflict. Although told more from the American point of view, the book also notes the political aspects of the war from the point of view of English leadership.Although I've studied plenty of history, I've never read much about the War of 1812, and this book filled the gap in a short time. The writing is vigorous and sprinkled with humor, some of it appropriately ironic. Highly recommended.",

Moreover, President Madison wasn't up to the task of leading the nation during wartime. During the war's course, the British burned the public buildings in Washington, D.C. and strangled U.S. maritime enterprises, although U.S. successes in the Battle of New Orleans and naval battles on the Great Lakes helped establish the U.S. as a military force to be reckoned with.Prof. Hickey has written a well researched book that has current day relevance, even though the War of 1812 isn't exactly a hot topic.

He dismisses the obvious, the merchant marine was the lifeblood of the young nation and the engine of prosperity. He ignores the personal - 6000 sailors impressed into British service. I try to imagine the sentiment of the nation during that era with so many of it's families impacted by that brutal British policy and the fate of the political party that supported the Jay Treaty. The Federalists were perceived as elitists who were more worried about their landed financial interests and less about the fate of the common man and the sovereignty of the nation. From that perception came the elitist label and the end of their party.In the Coming of War, Hickey all but calls the Republicans isolationists. In Conclusions, he accuses the Republicans of needless war mongering for political advantage. What he misses in between is a country who's sovereignty was under assault on multiple fronts. That Americans were not looking for a fight is obvious from the decade-long effort to stay out of the mess created by European elitists fighting endless wars. That some of the Federalists policies were in many respects better is obvious, but their demise is easy to understand.Getting this country to fight at all was a miracle brought about only after great effort and miscalculations on the part of Great Britain.Great Britain judged Americans wrongly: They didn't see a cohesive nation after they witnessed the easy flipping of coastal towns and assumed all Americans were so weakly bonded together. This was not the Second Revolutionary War or the Unnecessary War, it was the finishing battles of the first.Hickey calls the result of the war a failure of Republican policies. The real point is that the beginning of the war was a repudiation of the financially-centered policies of the Federalists. These policies, while convenient to a weak nation seeking economic growth, sacrificed national sovereignty - a position that can not be tolerated forever. That the all-powerful Federalists could disappear so early in the nations history is simple repudiation enough. That Hickey ignores the obvious for tortured logic is lazy scholarship. One can not help feel that he wrote many of these conclusions in allegiance to modern American politics.",

For many historians, his memoirs of this eventful period of U.S. history have become the single most important record of the war. Crusade in Europe tells the complete story of the war as Eisenhower planned and lived it. Through his eyes, the enormous scope and drama of the war - strategy, battles, moments of fateful decision - become fully illuminated in all their fateful glory. Yet this is also a warm and richly human account. Ike recalls the long months of waiting, planning, and working toward victory in Europe.

                "review/text": "\"Crusade In Europe\" is General Eisenhower's memoir of the period from the early days of World War II, during which America waited for its involvement to begin, through the early post-war dealings with our erstwhile allies. As the premier figure among the Western Allies, his story and observations are crucial to an understanding of the Great Crusade.Ike takes the reader along with him through each stage of the Crusade. We view events from a perspective which lets us see aspects which we otherwise might have missed. Having attracted attention for his performance in Army maneuvers in Louisiana in 1940, Ike was called to Washington immediately after Pearl Harbor because of his recent experience in the Philippines. He was immediately assigned to work on plans for the Pacific. At this point the reader is reminded that, in contrast to the later Germany First Policy, the American public, for a time, screamed for revenge on Japan before dealing with Germany.Assigned to command Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa in 1942, Ike was charged with obtaining Allied Cooperation and was plunged into the morass of French politics. The disappointing involvement with Gen. Giraud presented an intra-allied problem, as did cooperation of Adm. Darlan, who while too helpful to rebuff, brought with him the stigma of association with a collaborator. The age-old Arab-Jewish hostility further complicated the administration of the liberated territory.With North Africa cleared out, Ike was charged with the conquest of Sicily. Management of the Patton-Montgomery rivalry was a major challenge of the campaign. Success having been achieved, the Patton slapping incident forced Ike to reprimand a close friend while threatening to deprive him of one of his most effective Army commanders.Speculation that Ike would return to the Washington as Chief Of Staff while Gen. Marshall commanded Overlord, the invasion of Europe, distracted Ike's attention from problems at hand. Ike's eventual appointment to command Overlord forced him to leave the Mediterranean while the Italian campaign was still in doubt. Upon arrival in England he immediately switched gears to plan the size, timing, supply and location of the invasion of France.With the invasion ashore, Ike skillfully managed his coalition of impetuous commanders in their march across Europe. Ike brings the reader into the thought processes and conferences leading to decisions on the liberation of Paris, Operation Market-Garden (\"A Bridge Too Far\") and the Battle of The Bulge.Americans are familiar with Patton's claim that, with supplies, he could capture Berlin and win the war. Ike relates that Monty bothered him with similarly impractical suggestions. He then explains why the proposals were doomed to failure. Spirited arguments with the British over Project Anvil (Invasion of Southern France) come within the reader's vision through Ike's eyes.The greatest criticism of Ike's wartime leadership is reserved for questions about whether the Western Allies should have advanced further to limit the Red Army's area of occupation. Ike assesses the claims and presents support for his decisions.After V-E Day, Ike's role shifted more into that of a statesman as he attempted to obtain cooperation with the Russians over the administration of occupied Germany.Some things come clearly through the pages of this book. The reader is constantly impressed with the importance of supplies, bringing to mind the adage that \"Amateurs speak of tactics, professionals speak of logistics.\" Despite later controversies, Ike's admiration for Gen. George Marshall is made clear on the pages of this book. Written in 1948, I find the statement that Ike disagreed with many of FDR's domestic policies to be surprising and a hint of his later political initiatives. \"Crusade In Europe\" is written in a very clear, easy to read and follow, style. It never becomes bogged down in boring details. Among memoirs, this is a gem.",

The general explains how the real work of the military is developing strategy, drawing up plans, building relationships with governments and civilians, and quickly implementing and changing the plans as required. Only criticism is his tencency to dismiss the inappropriate behavior of Patton, but keep in mind that Patton was already dead when this book was written and Eisenhower would not criticize those who were not positioned to defend themselves. He is critical of others, especially Montgomery for his foolish proposal of launching a blitz on Berlin to bring the war to an early end. Another lesson for our time is the treachery of the French troops both in Vichy and Algeria, who fight the Allied invasion and put personal objectives above military and political goals. Unbelievable candor throughout such as when Eisenhower reports that an obviously overwhelmed Truman offers to help Eisenhower in any way that he can, including supporting him for the Presidency in 1948. Important career lesson: Eisenhower did not receive any significant promotions in the 20 years after WWI and was doing staff work under McArthur for 5 years, building up the Filipino military, yet became the highest rank allied commander, through hard work, dedication, and leadership.",

After reading this book it's easy to see why.This book is not as frank as we would expect today, and some of incidents are presented as if written by Norman Rockwell. Yet this book is excellent in presenting Eisenhower's view of the war. It is a view from on high, and it is best contrasted with Bradley's book, _A Soldier's Story_, which is much more emotional, direct and forthright.But it's easy to see Eisenhower's much broader perspective. He's much more concerned with the issues of organizing and prosecuting the war from the questions of where are we going to get the materials, the ships, the troops, the ammunition, the landing craft, etc., than is Bradley, who is almost completely--again remembering from 27 years ago--involved only with the battles and which division is where.Also, it's often not hard to read between the lines on those occassions when Eisenhower retreats into puff prose, to know what he was really thinking.5 stars, because I don't see how one can understand the military aspect of WWII in western Europe without having read this book.",

Morale is critical, requiring many factors and constant effort.It is the fleshed out, rounded picture of war and people that makes it interesting.

In this book, you can see the European war from the perspective of the man who led the war. What many considered Eisenhower's greatest asset, the diplomatic manner that helped the Americans and British function as one Allied team, is also very apparent in this book.Eisenhower's story, written just a few years after the war ended, gives the reader a great high-level perspective on the war. He mentions his staff work with the War Department at the beginning of the war before being posted to Europe, and then the balance of the book covers the Mediterranean and European campaigns against the Germans. This isn't a comprehensive history of the war in Europe (for example, he covers Operation Market-Garden in three paragraphs), but instead more of a general overview from Eisenhower's perspective.Many consider Eisenhower's diplomatic skills - his ability to lead a multi-national organization - as his greatest asset and the reason he was chosen to lead the Allied Armies in Europe. Eisenhower carried this over into his book: he is never critical of any of his subordinates, defends all of their actions and beliefs (even when Eisenhower disagreed or overruled them), and never even mentions specific names in the couple of instances where he says that commanders were relieved. While this is certainly a laudable trait in a leader, it doesn't make this a particularly insightful book.Although \"Crusade in Europe\" lacks that hard-hitting punch, Eisenhower does tell some entertaining and fun personal stories.

In his role as Commander, he was privy to a vast array of the decision making discussions that took place to create the Allied strategy against Nazi Germany. In this book, he brings to light a lot of the strategic thinking and planning that went into the Allied victory in WWII. Therefore, I would consider this book required reading for anyone interested in WWII history.Having said that, I think that the book does fall short of its objective for two main reasons. First, Ike is hesitant to criticize other leaders for bad decisions, and tactical mistakes. For instance, Ike blames the lack of success in Operation Market Garden more on the weather than the ill conceived plan that Monty used to execute this daring mission. Secondly, Ike does not display much emotion when telling the tale. For example, when Ike talks about the Battle of the Bulge, he infurs that the Allies expected the attack, and felt almost no panic when it came. If you look at books from others involved in the fighting, you get a much different perspective.Overall, I enjoyed this book and wished I could give it 5 stars. It should be a 5-star book, because of the unique position that Ike fulfilled in the ETO. Instead, I give it 4 stars, but highly recommend it to anyone interested in WWII history.",

(There weren't that many of them).One almost comical account was Churchill's insistance that he visit the Normandy beaches--on D-Day! Luckily, King George stepped in and resolved the situation and kept the 69 year-old Prime Minister in London on June 6.Ike does a pretty good job of keeping the Zeus-like egos of Montgomery, Patton and DeGaulle in check, too.In my opinion, Eisenhower doesn't get as much credit as he deserves, as just getting a force of the size of the Allied Expeditionary Force supplied with ammnuniton, fuel, food and the like was a monumental task.",

                "review/text": "I wanted this book to help me reconcile two very different interpretations of this disastrous war, which killed more than half of Paraguay's population. Eduardo Galeano's leftist polemic history, Open Veins of Latin America, calls it `a war of extermination', funded by British commerce, to rid the continent of a `dangerous example' of `autarchic internal development'. Meanwhile, Robert Harvey's Liberators, a tale of `larger-than-life heroes' puts the blame squarely on the `megalomaniac' Paraguayan president, Francisco Lopez, for `declaring war on Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay almost simultaneously'. Although Leuchars' book is self-declaredly a _military_ history, it seems to be one of the few studies of the war in print in English, and does yield some insights into the social, economic and diplomatic processes behind the war.Simmering border disputes in the River Plate region came to a head with the Brazilian invasion of Uruguay in October 1864, which removed the Blanco government allied with Paraguay. In response, Paraguay declared war on Brazil, and later sent its forces into the strip of Argentina which separates it from Uruguay. Although Lopez doubtless played some of his cards badly, his fear that his larger neighbours would, at some point, try to dismember his country seems to have been borne out by the terms of Triple Alliance treaty between Brazil, Argentina, and (nominally) Uruguay. These hardly referred to the supposed causes of the war, but concentrated on how Paraguay's land was to be divided up between its two largest neighbours.The war lasted until the Paraguayan forces were obliterated, which took over four years. Leuchars spends a lot of time wondering why Lopez was determined to fight on, but not why his compatriots, including many women and boys, continued to rally to his flag, even after the Allies had obviously won. So often does the author describe the Paraguayans' courage that he apologises to the reader for the lack of variety in his superlatives. Lopez' vicious behaviour - - he even accused his mother of betraying him and had her publicly whipped - - only highlights the need to understand why so many were willing to follow him to death. The book has only an occasional hint at any ideology motivating the Allies, such as their troops mocking Lopez as an `old Indian', and their post-war prohibition of the Guarani language in schools.It's often easy to write off a national catastrophe by blaming it on the victims' leader. This book does demonstrate that there were other causes, but stops short of exploring them fully.",

                "review/text": "A few weeks after the US Civil War ended in 1865, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay formed the &quot;Triple Alliance&quot; to fight against Paraguay. The war was not nearly as one-sided as it might seem on first glance, for at the time, Paraguay's army was larger than its combined enemies. Paraguay struck first, invading Brazil and Argentina, but was ultimately beaten back and ground down. By war's end in 1870, Paraguay had lost huge tracts of territory, its President and its entire army, and an astonishing 60 percent of its population.Leuchars' account of the war is well-documented and readable. The opening chapters analyze the political climate in each country. Paraguay's erratic dictator, Francisco Solano Lopez, is generally blamed for the war. He had a large army (70,000 strong), a shrewd sense of military tactics, and he enjoyed a fanatical devotion from the public, yet his strategic aims were never clear --we simply do not know what Lopez hoped to get out of the war. Argentina's President Mitre was a modernizer who presided over an unstable country still gripped by conflict over whether to be a centralized or federated state. Brazilian Emperor Pedro II, also a modernizer, similarly faced challenges from regional warlords, as well as slavery and a shockingly unequal distribution of land and income. Uruguay was in the throes of civil war between its modernizing Colorado and oligarchic Blanco parties. Against this backdrop, Paraguay's Lopez deserves most --but not all-- of the blame for the war. The conflict began when the various countries took different sides in Uruguay's civil war, but that was quickly subsumed by each country's territorial aspirations rooted in the region's still-unfixed borders.Leuchars does an excellent job of sorting out the motives of each government and reexamining established historical conclusions. The maps are frequent and excellent. The &quot;big picture&quot; analysis of the war's impact on the region, and particularly on Paraguay's future, is persuasive. Ultimately, Paraguay's population was reduced to 125,000, less than half of its prewar number through military losses and the extreme hardship endured by the citizens. Brazil lost an estimated 100,000 troops and civilians and Argentina another 25,000. These numbers, given the rural nature of the societies, are unimaginable in today's wars.&quot;To The Bitter End&quot; is timely. There is simply not much recent writing in English about the War of the Triple Alliance. And apart from Paraguay, where the consequences remain an indelible part of the national character, it is a war in danger of being forgotten even in South America. This is an excellent book.",

                "review/text": "The previous reviewer does a good job of detailing what the book is about. Francisco Lopez declares war on Brazil and Argentina because they interfered in the internal politics of Uruguay. Uruguay (under a Liberal government) sides with Brazil and Argentina. Paraguay invades both Argentina and Brazil and seizes property and land. These three states form the Triple Alliance and roll back the Paraguay invasion and then invade Paraguay.It is interesting to make a present day equation with another state called North Korea. Both are headed by sons of dictators who assume the dictatorship. Both are isolationist and militaristic. Both pose a threat to their neighbors. I am surprised that in the summary, the author did not make the comparison. But the author strictly details the history and politics of the war. Hats off to Mr. Leuchars for detailing this bloody conflict which caused the death of 60% of Paraguay's population.After reading the book, the military battles come off a bit dry. Lopez's terrorism is something else. He shot his own brother and had his mother and sisters whipped because he thought they were plotting against him. Presently Paraguay makes him out as a hero, but the reader is left to come to his own conclusion. Leuchars explains that without him, Paraguay may have ceased being a nation.Again I commend the author for writing about a little known conflict. I wish he would have included some photographs in this book, although the maps were great. The only reason I gave it a four rather than a five star, is that the military aspect was rather dry reading.",

I wish, however, to state my reservations about the book.One oddity is that the first three chapters cover the events leading to the war, but the last chapter ends abruptly with the armistice. It would have been nice to have a chapter on the Treaty of Versailles.The book incorporates two previously published articles, as the acknowledgements acknowledge. This leads to the repetition of certain data, as it appears that they were not sufficiently edited to fit in with the rest of the book.Keegan is British, and it is obvious. He emphasizes repeatedly how the British army was never defeated by the Germans except in one campaign. The Australians are praised as the world's greatest soldiers without further elaboration. He explicitly blames Germany's naval construction campaign preceding the war for the war itself, presumably because it challenged Britain's benign supremacy. The deaths of British soldiers are lamented with poignancy that overflows into sentimentality.To be fair, the book was written for a British audience, and these excesses are much more modest than they might have been. Keegan seems to have tried hard to be evenhanded, and these excesses are largely superficial and forgivable.Lastly, Keegan admits that this book does not break new ground. A glance at the endnotes reveals that most of the material from this book was taken from secondary sources. Each chapter seems to have come from three or so books. Thus, this is not a work of history so much as a gloss on history written by others.",

                "review/text": "John Keegan' \"The First World War\" is one of those rare books which combine the thoroughly researched descriptions of history, technology and means of warfare with nuances of psychology and mystery of the Great War. Keegan starts with the overview of diplomatic positions of the Great powers involved in the war (although his analysis of origins is on his own admission is just a summary of prior work), then proceeds to the breakout of the conflict. In subsequent chapters Keegan covers every year of the Great War on the Western, Eastern, Middle Eastern, Italian and Mediterranean theatres of war in a thorough and scholarly fashion. Very soon a pattern emerges - a static trench warfare on the Western front, in-conclusive war of movement on the Eastern front with untold unaccounted casualties, diversionary operations on the secondary theatres costing significant resource drain, and pointless war of heroics, despotism and bravery on the Italian front.What I like particularly about the book is the analysis of military strategy and tactics of the main participant in the manner which somebody without training in military science can easily comprehend. Keegan points out how lack of communication, rigid bureaucratic organization and the lack of appreciation of the tactical variability of the war caused British failures to command a decision at Somme in 1916 and Ypres and Flanders in 1917; how ill-prepared was French army for defensive operations due to its romantic \"esprit de corpes\"; how Russian lack of coordination, material supply and organization lead to horrendous losses on the Western front. Germans came out as good fighters, allowing their field commanders high degree of freedom, yet weak strategically, unable to concentrate the efforts on a single point of the decisive breakthrough. Keegan touches on the naval warfare as well, specifically Jutland, but since navy in the Great war played mostly static positional role, he does not spend much time there.Overall, I found his book fair and non-biased; essentially without any political agenda. Keegan is more interested in uncovering the mystery of the war as the source of human suffering, then finding a particular side to blame. To this degree this is a rare book.",

While not a truly &quot;modern&quot; war, many of the instruments of death were well hoaned (e.g. the rifle, the machine gun and artillery). This book describes the horror of trench warfare, details the attacks and defenses, the general's attempts to break the stalemate, the mathematics of attrition, the political motivations, and most importantly, the effect on nations that established the groundwork for the second world war.

The description of the opening battles in 1914 is difficult to follow if one is not familiar with European geography.2) The writing is turgid in places. Keegan's description of the Battle of the Somme repeats the phrase &quot;The Germans were fighting for their lives&quot; at least twice in close succession. Well, of course they were!3) The analysis is thin in critical areas, particularly in analyzing pre-war events. Lack of communication was a problem, but it appears that the political systems of the European powers placed control of events in the hands of the people who had no incentive to practice restraint, and who had clearly performed no serious thought as to how new weaponry (particularly the machine gun!) would affect the conduct of war: the military commanders.Despite the problems, I didn't have much trouble finishing the book. This book was my first comprehensive history of WWI, and has stimulated my curiousity about that war. I think Mr. Keegan is to be complimented on releasing this book. For Americans, WWI is a forgotten war, and I thank him for a sobering and thought-provoking look at this conflict that destroyed men, nations, and ideals without mercy.",

His book was used as a text in a college level history course, which is where I read it, and helped a great deal.The accounts of lesser know theaters of conflict are certainly some of the book's high points. My favorite section was a the German, Paul Lettow von Vorbeck, who was in charge of the German forces in German East Africa. Keegan describes how Vorbeck waged a guerrilla war against English forces for the duration of the war. It is great reading. There are other chapters equally insightfull.Overall, the Keegan rarely becomes traped in the minutia of detail, though at times the various armies, regiments, battalions, and dates can become a bit thick. This is a book that needs about one or two days inbetween chapters for thought fermentation. You need to let it all sink in before moving on, otherwise the details slip away.I highly recomend this book to anyone who knows little about WW1 and wishes to learn more- or, like myself, someone who thought that they knew most of what there was to know (and was wrong).Professors everywhere: get books like this one for classes, they are better than texts, cheaper, and more enjoyable to read!

Maybe I was expecting to learn something. But the book was a big disappointment.First off, the editing was quite poor. On several occasions there are sentences that make no sense whatsoever. There are mislabeled maps and misspellings of simple words.The maps themselves are pretty much useless. They should have some relevance to the accompanying text, usually they don't. For example, the text will talk about a battle by a town. You look on the map, the town is not there. There seems to be little attempt to make the book comprehensible to anybody but the biggest WWI scholars.The main point of the book is that the war's origins are a mystery. Contrast that to The Guns of August, Barbara Tuchmann comes up with several reasons that were apparently ignored by Keegan.The book does make a good point about how the war started out simply as a local conflict, Serbia vs. Austria-Hungary. While Keegan stresses that point, he flounders at what could have been done to avoid it.Keegan avoids other issues, the unprecedented reliance on machines in this war, on the introduction of airplanes, of the widespread use of poison gas. There is little 1st-person documentation in the book either, contrary to the dust jacket, one fails to get an idea of &quot;how it felt&quot;.Ideally, the shortcomings of this book could have been masked by making it part of a multi-media package. A computer CD that would stress and visualize Keegan's points would have been a huge help.In conclusion, the book reminded me of several classes I took in college. You would have a very learned teacher in front of the room. But knowledge itself does not make a good teacher, the ability to impart and transfer that knowledge makes the teacher good. Sorry, Mr. Keegan, you may be a wonderfully knowledgeable historian, but the book did not transfer that knowledge very well.Howard Wexler",

There is no description or analysis, however, of the major social or political changes that occurred during the war, and relatively little on the experience of combat. His analysis, as opposed to description of the outbreak of the war, is embarassing. There has to be better conclusion than lack of rapid communications, though this may have been a contributing factor. There are other disappointing features. There are relatively few maps, and in an operational history, this is a major defect. The bibliography is scanty considering the huge literature on this subject and an essential feature of any good one volume history of a major subject is an extensive bibliography and interpretative bibliographic essay on the secondary literature. For example, see the bibliographies in any volume of the outstanding Oxford History of the United States. Keegan does relatively well on the Eastern Front campaigns, which tend to be obscured by the huge literature on the Western Front, but his coverage of the critical Atlantic submarine conflicts is poor. Writing a one volume history of WWI would be very difficult, but Keegan had not even come close to doing a satisfactory job. For comparison, see the shorter but insightful book by the French scholar Marc Ferro, which does a much better job of providing an overview of the conflict, its causes, and its aftermath.

The analysis of the battles is not very detailed and the tactical issues are not treated in depth. Admittedly, the author refuses to consider the tactical handling of battles as a crucial point in determining the reasons for the stalemate on the Western Front. His point (imbalance between the advance in weapons technology and transport and communication means) carries conviction, but the scholarly debate on the importance of the tactics is too superficially dismissed: in the least, it would have been helpful to illustrate the other historians' views on the subject. The naval and air operations are treated in a very sketchy way and nothing new is said about them. The economical and social background of the warring nations is simply ignored, although some of the books cited in the bibliography examine it in detail. The consequences of the war are explained superficially; to state that the First World War it's a &quot;mistery&quot; (misterious it's cause, misterious it's prosecution after so many casualties in the first year) is amazing: since the first years of the XX century it was clear to any military men and to many politicians that a war was impending and more and more voices even advocated it (See D. Herrmann, &quot;The arming of Europe and the making of the First World War&quot;). Finally, Europe was NOT a &quot;power for good and wealth&quot; for herself and the world: just look at the facts related in T. Pakenham's &quot;The Scramble for Africa&quot; to see what the benefits were of European domination of the Black Continent. I don't mean to make here an ideological critic; I say that this statement is superficial and simplistic from the historical point of view.

Unfortunately for him, MacArthur's long time intelligence chief, General Willoughby, had assured MacArthur there would be no attack. Rather than be embarrassed Willoughby destroys the report and drives the young Marine Captain into early retirement.However, Willoughby's plan is blocked by two developments. First, North Korea attacks South Korea on June 25 and no Marines are being retired. Second, our Captain's friend and sponsor, General Pickering intervenes and carries the story to President Truman.American lack of preparedness at the beginning of the Korean War is one of the bitter lessons every preparedness advocate (and I am one) points to in arguing for a strong peacetime America. Our Army was untrained, unequipped, and undermanned. The Marines were drastically undermanned. Our equipment was inferior to the North Korean Russian-supplied equipment. Our restrictions on the South Koreans did not stop the war (as every liberal hoped it would) they simply made it more tempting for North Korea to attack..This book maintains a wonderful balance between MacArthur as an egocentric isolated and eccentric personality on the one hand and a military genius of the first order on the other. The consistent rejection of his daring Inchon landing by every traditional senior officer is a good reminder as we look toward Iraq and elsewhere that when in doubt bureaucracies are boring, unimaginative and take the enormous risk of taking no risks at all..I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the art of decision-making at very senior levels and the nature of war when you let your country go unprepared.

You'd best catch up on your sleep before bringing it home, because it takes 2 days to read, and you can't put it down til the last page.",

Griffin closes his accounts of World War II and transports his men to the devastation of the Korean War.Scott Brick, veteran voice actor, author and writer, whose stage credits include Cyrano, Hamlet and Macbeth, artfully carries listeners through the Unabridged version. Tony Award winner James Naughton (Chicago and City Of Angels) gives superlative voice to the Abridged versions.Few writers perceive the military stance as accurately as author Griffin, thus bringing pulse quickening reality to his tales. The year is 1950 as Under Fire opens. Despite its authenticity Captain Ken McCoy's warning of trouble in North Korea is largely ignored. Moreover, McCoy is dismissed from the Corps.Yet shortly, as history has shown, Korea becomes a deathly morass, and another challenging battle for the Marines.For those who enjoy military thrills and excitement Under Fire is 1A.- Gail Cooke",

                "review/text": "I agree that Griffin's Brotherhood of War, early Corps and Badge books were good, but he has definitely lapsed into a tedious formula and his characters and situations have gotten insanely far-fetched. Sure, Craig Lowell, Sandy Felter and Matt Payne were not exactly realistic, but at least they were likeable characters who kind of worked their way up the chain. The characters in the Corps have become purely obnoxious and invulnerable - like James Bond with none of his charm.It started with Ken \"Killer\" McCoy being the best at everything (\"The only Marines who could hold a Thompson steady while firing were Chesty Puller and McCoy\" etc. ad naus). Then the ridiculous Captain/General/Jedi Knight Fleming Pickering (What's next?-\"Flem, we're gonna make you a Cardinal so you can straighten out the Pope\").At first, characters breaking the rules and bucking authority was kept reasonable, like Lowell's battlefield improvisations, but then it became a glorification of any rebel. McCoy's brother beating officers near to death but going on the war bond tour seems like the ultimate Griffin hero. Which of course leads to their sex lives, and Griffin's belief that any woman will fall in love if you rough her up. These characters all seem based on Robert Conrad in \"Baa Baa Black Sheep.\"As others have mentioned, Griffin has a problem with enlisted characters, and also with conventional battlefield scenes. Even if a Lance Corporal performs well in a brief battle, he must instantly become an officer (and one working directly for the President or Secretary), get his AAAA1 flight clearance (\"Sorry, General Eisenhower, you got bumped by Lt. Studley\")and go off to some supersecret mission.Lastly, the author is a bit too excited with his own cleverness - rehashing the same cute observations about how funny military protocols are (Yes, enough with the \"NMI\" in Stecker's name!).All that said, W.E.B. Griffin is selling millions of books and making tons more money than I'll ever see - so he obviously knows what he's doing.",

Never have I felt so betrayed by an author.This could have been, MIGHT have been, put together from excerpts of his other books. Mostly character descriptions, descriptions of past events tying characters together, explaining relationships and the like. But no action to speak of, and when it shows up, it's not worthy of the Killer.This book is not worthy of Killer McCoy. It makes me sad.

I am suprized I haven't before, however I suppose that there are so many reviews written about the previous books in this series that my opinion is in agreement with those who enjoy this series immensely.This is an excellent addition. The main characters, Ken McCoy, Fleming Pickering and his son Fleming Pickering Jr, Ed Banning, Ernie Zimmerman and all the others are important in the plot of the book.The year is 1950, and it is the beginning of the Korean War. Capt. McCoy is convinced that the North Koreans are a threat and will start a war, however the higher brass dosen't share his opinion and try to kick him out of the USMC. It turns out that McCoy is 100% on the money. Thus begins the interesting story. There of course is combat, political and military intrigue, and of course the women who love their Marines are in the book as well. My favorite is Ernestine &quot;Ernie&quot; McCoy, Capt McCoys wife, she is the type of woman that any man would be fortunate to have as a girlfriend or wife.This is a fine addition to &quot;The Corps&quot; series. It is a definite page turner that will have the reader well up into the early morning hours. I just got finished and am eagerly awaiting for Mr. Griffins next addition to this fine series.Highly recommended!",

                "review/text": "This novel is a solid and very informative overview of the war with Iraq, including a review of the earlier Desert Storm campaign and some reflections on the 12 years of containment and attrition the U.S. and the United Kingdom engaged in against Saddam Hussein.Murray, one of the best military historians of our generation, and Scales, a retired Army major general and one of the leading intellectuals on the art of war and technological change, combine to give this book an enormous chronicle of warfare contemplation. A wide range of personal relationships also allowed the authors to interview many of the key participants immediately following the battles.The Iraq War captures the audacity and daring of General Franks' campaign plan and the persistent boldness with which it was executed. Also emphasized is the fact that the component commanders truly understood Franks' intent and, when in doubt, took risks and kept pushing the envelope for more speed and more surprise.There are no gigantic revelations in the authors' account of Operation Iraqi Freedom and their assessment of what worked and what didn't; however, they highlight some principles that every sophisticated American should reflect upon when thinking about our future national security policies. Several of these principles are covered in the remainder of this review.Murray and Scales signify the human element in war and the stunning mismatch in technology, training, experience, and professionalism between the coalition and the Iraqis. But once the fighting shifted into the existing guerilla phase, most of those advantages lost much of their force.An implicit contrast is drawn between the Marine Corps system of every member being a rifleman and every convoy being expected to protect itself and the very different Army model of inadequately trained non-combat soldiers being protected by combat forces. It is clear from their outline of events that the Marine Corps progress through the inhabited areas was actually much more challengeable than the third division's drive through the desert. This is not to minimize the extraordinary speed and drive of the Army's flanking maneuver, but it does raise an interesting question about examining more carefully the Marine Corps doctrine for urban warfare (and their practice of policing areas with the support of local people).The authors report favorably on the subtle, intelligence-led British effort to capture Basra with minimum casualties to the Shia and the way in which this effort made policing the city much easier. Americans could gain an education from the British in the art of policing potentially hostile people.The largest intelligence failure of the war was our underestimation of the power of the Baathist secret police and the torture system they employed to force others to continue fighting against us. This mistake was compounded by the fact that we didn't comprehend the bitterness that the Shia people had harbored toward us since 1991. In that year, they rebelled at what they thought was President George H.W. Bush's suggestion and then 50,000 were slaughtered by Saddam's forces, while the U.S. did nothing. In the early stages of the Iraq war, these people were restrained by a palpable fear that we would not persist, and they would not risk helping us until they were confident that our troops were there for the duration.The role of the Syrians and other hostile forces is undeniably clear. One example cited is &quot;the enemy was far more skilled ... Hornbuckle was later to learn that most of the attacking fedayeen were not Iraqis but Syrian jihadists who had made the trip to Baghdad specifically to kill Americans; out of the thirty POWs captured on Curly, twenty-eight were Syrians.&quot; (p. 215)This and other references raise not only the question of why the Syrian dictatorship was allowing them to enter Iraq but also speculate where these enemies were being trained, since it their training was clearly superior to that of their Iraqi counterparts.A succinct description of the second campaign requirements to rebuild a new system of safety, health, prosperity, and freedom are worth being read by every American:&quot;Success in this new war will not be gauged by how many Republican Guard tanks are destroyed but by the less tangible and quantifiable measurement of people's acceptance of a new Iraqi leadership. Attitudes will be influenced less by demonstrations of fighting strength than by the emotional security that comes from safe streets, employment, electricity and fresh water. ... wars are conducted by human beings for political ends.&quot;(p. 237)Every informed American should read this book to place their embedded memories of specific events into the larger context of the two campaigns of the war. The first campaign we won brilliantly. The second, we are now engaged in. We should make sure that we learn from these campaigns and apply our learned knowledge to the next time.",

The writers are insightful, with expert, well researched and provide compelling information gleaned from expert well connected sources whom they had long term friendships and associations with.The book appears factually written without an apparent political agenda. An increasingly important factor for books coming out this year.Truly substantial information, facts, and details of the war. Substantially more than will be commented on here. Many disparate situations are better understood and explained by this book - like how can a mechanical support team get lost in the middle of combat?Political Year Issues:General Franks re-wrote modern military tactics with his blitzkrieg through Iraq to topple one of the most brutal dictatorships with the (one time) 5th best army in the world. Could the war have been won with much greater costs and loss of life on both sides?Good thought provoking information including substantial captured Syrian jihad troops in the fedayeen forces - what were they doing there? What does this mean to us in looking forward to the next middle eastern crisis?Questions Remaining:If we found no weapons of mass destruction, but we knew they were there before (they were previously used and the US, England, France and Russia sold them to Saddam Hussein and all agreed they were there at one time). Where did they go? Do the presence of Syrian jihad troops give us a strong enough linkage to pursue Syria for the missing WMD's? (This is my personal belief, for what little it is worth.) The point being there is no evidence of the WMD's being destroyed, therefore they must be someplace. Buried in the desert? Or, in a neighboring country?What is Syria's role in this war (with its superiorly trained troops), and potential aftermath issues that will have to be addressed within this decade? Syria remains a dictatorship that harbors and trains terrorists in its Bacca Valley and still plans to drive every Israeli Jew into the Mediterranean Sea - regardless of any peace treaty.Negatives:Could use more dialogue to bring out the first hand experience, rather than being a citation.Could have used more maps and diagrams. These are really essential for digesting troop movements relative to cities, and relative locations in a fairly dispersed and desolate land.",

This work examines the origins of this humble weapon and the 'cult of the bayonet' as espoused by the Russian General Alexander Suvorov who asserted that The bullet misses, the bayonet does not. The first bayonets appeared in France in the early 17th century and soon they were being used by every army in Europe. The author examines the spread of this simple weapon and how it led to fundamental changes being made in battlefield tactics. Over 300 years later, in the age of hi-tech warfare and weapons of mass destruction, the bayonet is still in service with armies around the world. British and US forces in Afghanistan regularly have their bayonets fixed. Fix Bayonets illustrates how tactics changed and the design of the weapon, although fundamentally the same, has evolved over the centuries.Much myth and legend surrounds the subject of bayonet charges and the weapon has become an icon of defiance and the determination to do whatever it takes to win. The author examines evidence for the reality of such actions. How did the ordinary soldier feel to be told 'fix bayonets'? John Norris draws on personal accounts of soldiers using bayonets in combat from the Napoleonic and Crimean Wars, various Colonial campaigns, through the World Wars, Falklands War and into the 21st century in Afghanistan. In so doing he explains the seemingly anachronistic survival of this simple weapon on the modern battlefield.",

        "Title": "the transformation of war the most radical reinterpretation of armed conflict since clausewitz",
        "description": "At a time when unprecedented change in international affairs is forcing governments, citizens, and armed forces everywhere to re-assess the question of whether military solutions to political problems are possible any longer, Martin van Creveld has written an audacious searching examination of the nature of war and of its radical transformation in our own time. For 200 years, military theory and strategy have been guided by the Clausewitzian assumption that war is rational-a reflection of national interest and an extension of politics by other means. However, van Creveld argues, the overwhelming pattern of conflict in the post-1945 world no longer yields fully to rational analysis. In fact, strategic planning based on such calculations is, and will continue to be, unrelated to current realities. Small-scale military eruptions around the globe have demonstrated new forms of warfare with a different cast of characters - guerilla armies, terrorists, and bandits-pursuing diverse goals by violent means with the most primitive to the most sophisticated weapons. Although these warriors and their tactics testify to the end of conventional war as we've known it, the public and the military in the developed world continue to contemplate organized violence as conflict between the super powers. At this moment, armed conflicts of the type van Creveld describes are occurring throughout the world. From Lebanon to Cambodia, from Sri Lanka and the Philippines to El Salvador, the Persian Gulf, and the strife-torn nations of Eastern Europe, violent confrontations confirm a new model of warfare in which tribal, ethnic, and religious factions do battle without high-tech weapons or state-supported armies and resources. This low-intensity conflict challenges existing distinctions between civilian and solder, individual crime and organized violence, terrorism and war. In the present global atmosphere, practices that for three centuries have been considered uncivilized, such as capturing civilians or even entire communities for ransom, have begun to reappear. Pursuing bold and provocative paths of inquiry, van Creveld posits the inadequacies of our most basic ideas as to who fights wars and why and broaches the inevitability of man's need to \"play\" at war. In turn brilliant and infuriating, this challenge to our thinking and planning current and future military encounters is one of the most important books on war we are likely to read in our lifetime.",

                "review/text": "When I finished reading this book I could hardly believe that a writer could prophesize the future war events in such a clear way. Van Creveld's thesis is that war as we know it in the last 3,5 centuries (waged between states and organized armies) has reached its end and is now in a process of radical tramsformation. Analyzing many examples from the military history he suggests that we are entering into an era where states lose the monopoly of waging war and confront non-state actors who do not embrace the same philosophical values.Van Creveld overturns Clauzewitz's traditional views one by one, using very convincing arguments, and unfortunately he is confirmed by international events today. While reading the book there were many cases when I was dumbfounded by the fact that a writer completing his work near the end of the Cold War could see our era with such a clarity, and I was really amazed by the fact that the book was written in 1991. It is more modern than anything else I have read on the subject of modern war and surpasses even contemporary analysis. Van Creveld does not avoid to touch even hot topics, like the sheer joy of fighting (paraphrasing Clausewitz he states that war is more the continuation of sports by other means than politics) the taboo of introducing women in the armies, the role of religion in the motivation of war and the very important argument that war does not begin when someone is willing to kill but when he is willing to die for a cause.The accuracy of his predictions is often so amazing that it becomes terrifying, especially when he states that in the future the war leaders will not be legitimate government officials but something like \"The Old Man in the Mountains\", meaninig the kind of warfare waged by assassins in the Middle Ages. He is also very critical against the current military-industrial complex and its super-expensive creations of high tech weapons, saying that all this paraphernalia of old war are like dinosaurs about to face extinction. This is a highly recommended book and it is sure that it will challenge many of your establised views on war.",

Creveld shows that while the militaries of the West has run away on a shopping spree to acqurie the new nifty things in the shape of fighter jets, submarines, and laser guided missiles the enemy in the shape of guerillas and terrorist have acquired other, less advanced means, to fight back. The US helicopters that were shot down in Somalia and Afghanistan were not taken down with high tech missiles - instead they were grounded by RPG-7s, a grenade launcher from the 1950s.But Creveld does so much more with this book. Rather than being a book only about the future of war it is about the future of the international system. Creveld's book has greatly influenced other writers such as Robert Kaplan who wrote \"The Coming Anarchy\".Believers in technology, the wonders of globalization, and the supremacy of the nation state should read this book and seriously consider it.

In his more classic books like 'Supplying War: Logistics from Wallerstein to Patton' he wrote VERY credible military history that shook some of the foundations of less-sound strategic thought that was occuring concurrently; he has also written a powerful critique of people who have hopped on the shoulders of NGOs and non-state actors AND state-centered people in 'The Rise and Decline of the State'. Personally, these have over time become two of my favorite books: perhaps a couple years from now, this shall finish the trinity.Van Crevald puts forth a case that the era of massed conventional wars have finished. For a variety of reasons, the Central-front type conflicts between the USSR and US of the fifties never happened and never will. The more conflicts have happened, the more correct he appears (this book is already eleven years old...) Trying to prepare for them is silly (much in the same way , he asserts, that National Missile Defense is....)This is a must read for students of military strategy and affairs and international politics in general. Its quite a worthwhile book as general reading, though I think that it might be at present out of print. I highly recommend it-- and the other books listed at the beginning of this review....",

The whole point of &quot;scholarship&quot; is to arrive at truth; its a means to an end, not an end unto itself. To those who are unwilling to let go of the skirt of von Clausewitz, no amount of &quot;scholarship&quot; is going to be enough, perhaps not even an American city in ashes from a backpack nuclear device planted there by a terrorist who works for no nation-state. There are many books out there that are &quot;scholarly&quot; and clueless about what is going on in the conflict arena, they should be discarded and ignored by those of us charged to defend freedom from real, not imagined armchair enemies. Van Crevald is right, he makes his point without pounding his intellect over your head with minutiae or academia that would distract the reader from the fact that he is talking about life and death of millions of actual, real living human beings (you and I) not some abstract bookworm debate.The Transformation of War is a critical book to the survival of the West; it outlines that we are really in the 4th Generation of war, not the &quot;Third Wave&quot; of human ego-gratifying human progress as outlined by the Tofflers in War and Anti-War. Van Crevald looks into the human condition and admits the truth we do not want to accept that man likes to kill---and that it may have NOTHING to do with Clausewitz's &quot;war is a continuation of [nation-state] policy by other means&quot;. Some groups even in an idealized, &quot;New World Order&quot; will simply fight because they want to fight; the blood lust of man runs in his own heart, and no amount of human technological gadgetry will change this basic condition--only divine intervention will do this. If we perpetuate bad nation-state warfare hoping to relive WWII-style 3d Generation warfare &quot;Desert Storms&quot; by safe, push-button warfare using air and missile strikes with digital means tacked on, or loudly sail around the world in surface ships to posture as being willing to fight (but not really on the ground far inland) when we are actually seen from space where we are easily targeted and destroyed---we will miss Van Crevald's sub-national state warrior who bypasses our irrelevant sea-based showboat military and strikes directly at the American people with subtle, psychological information warfare and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Van Crevald should know--he's an Israeli and he has seen first hand how traditional nation-state war forms have been poor tools to fight 4th Generational wars like the Intifada and the insurgency at the order of Lebanon. The troubles Israel are facing are warnings to the west, and Van Crevald is trying to sound the alarm--if we are wise enough to hear him.",

I stumbled across this book almost by accident; I haven't been the same since.Prophecy is a tough trade; Van Creveld passes the test. This work is the first and best study of what is now called \"4th Generation War\". Indeed, it is not only -- put plain and simple -- the best theoretical work on war since Clausewitz, but it also offers an astonishingly pellucid view into the future of war. In Chapter 6, Van Creveld reaches a level of insight and eloquence about the fighting man not seen since Homer. Anyone who grew up hating war during the Vietman period, or who formed his views on war from Paul Fussell, or who posted greazy posters about how \"war is not healthy for children and other living things\" needs to allow himself to be transformed by _The Transformation of War_, Chapter 6.

Some of it is right, some is not (e.g. the workings of the Roman Army are oversimplified). My major gripe is that it equates the modern state to a war making organization: when classic armies disappear, the state disappears too. The modern state probably was born as the most effective warmaking organization of his time but others could argue that it was born as the most efficient task collecting organization of his time. In any case today it does a lot more than putting armies in the field and collecting taxes. Plus it has infinite resources compared to a small group of, say, terrorists. A state that is well led and aware of the dangers of low-intensity conflicts can survive byadopting the same techniques and exporting the conflict as much as possible. Unfortunately, on one thing van Creveld may be right, that this will force the state to adopt terrorists' techniques.",

Human Social Behvaior is a result of our biological evolution and should not be seperated from our understanding of ourselves.

                "review/text": "What this book is about is described by the title: The Transformation of War. The book is an examination of the factors which influenced the development of military practice in the West. There are two main factors:(a)the development of technology, particularly as it applies to weapons and their use in war and (b)the influence of Karl von Clausewitz and his theories of war on Western military establishments. The importance of technology and of Clausewitz came about as a result of the pre-eminence of the Prussian military in Europe in the latter part of the 19th century. They were one of the first military establishments to successfully use new technologies in the development of artillery, communications (the telegraph) and especially the railroad to help them fight wars. As a result armies in other countries adopted many of their ideas and practices, including Clausewitz's theories on the nature of war.Van Creveld argues that in today's world, reliance upon technology alone to solve military problems, simply will not work. There is no all-purpose technological solution to the problems that modern armies face. To support his argument he cites the experiences of the Israeli Army during the invasion of Lebanon in 1983. The Israeli Army which invaded was the best equipped, most powerful military force in Israel's history. Yet it ended by becoming bogged down in Lebanon against a foe armed mainly with Kalashnikovs and RPG's. He also argues that Clausewitz and his theories about the nature of war, and how it should be fought are no longer applicable. For example, Clausewitz believed that the essence of war involved a climatic final battle in which opposing armies fought until one was destroyed or surrendered. Only in this way could victory be guaranteed to the winner. The problem is, he doesn't have much to say about terrorist attacks or fighting and defeating an insurgency. As a consequence you have armies which are created, trained, and equipped to fight conventional wars trying to defeat terrorists or insurgents who have absolutely no intention of fighting that kind of war. What these armies are looking for is an opposing army that they can engage in battle. But the enemy that they're fighting doesn't fight that way, so a battle such as Clausewitz describes is never going to take place. Basically, these armies are trained to fight the wrong kind of war.In light of events which are now taking place in Iraq the insights and analysis that the book provides are especially relevant. If you want to get some understanding of why things are going the way going in Iraq, you should read this book.",

What unfolds is far different from what was said publicly at the time.Occasionally, the New York Times reporter's and the retired Marine's apparent biases show through, detracting from an otherwise very good book. They seem to blame President Reagan's administration for not buying mine-clearing equipment for the Marines and the Navy, but then blame the Air Force--and not the administration--for using its money to buy items other than the latest survival radios for its aircrews. They also inaccurately claim that the Air Force developed a new doctrine for this war where they would be in charge of all theater airpower (a doctrinal concept developed by them during the North African campaign in World War II) and that the Strategic Air Command had controlled the B-52s deployed to Southeast Asia during the Viet Nam War (they actually were operationally controlled by the Theater), as well as a few other inaccurate items regarding the Air Force. It became rather apparent that all Services that were not Marines (and to a lesser extent, Navy) were denigrated. An example is their claim that the Air Force required that friendly aircraft obtain two means to verify an unknown aircraft's identification before firing on it in order to hold down the Navy's 'kill' rate (since the Navy had not invested in the systems to install two separate means of identification on each of their aircraft, they needed to contact the AWACS to obtain the second means). The Viet Nam War demonstrated this requirement and for whatever reason, the Navy had not addressed it in the interim--which the authors evidently refused to say.After summarizing what the politicians and military should do differently next time (after acknowledging that the media's outcry that the military had created killing zones north of Kuwait City partially caused the premature ending of the war), they also conveniently omitted a recommendation on what the media should do differently.Although the items cited above and a few similar ones throughout the book are distracting and cast some doubt on the entire book, their documented sources were sufficient (approximately one per page) to make them generally believable.I would recommend the book to anyone wanting to know what occurred behind the scenes, with a caution that it should be read critically and not be used as the reader's only source.",

As the title indicates, the book places a heavy emphasis on the actions of the senior military officers involved in the planning and execution of the U.S.-led coalition's 1991 war against Iraq. In the preface, the authors note that this conflict \"is without precedent in the annals of warfare. It was the dawn of a new era\" (page x).In their acknowledgements section, the authors discuss in detail the research that went into the writing of this book. They note that they interviewed administration officials, diplomats, allied military officers, and intelligence experts; they observe further that some \"talked on the record; others on a not-for-attribution basis.\" They also drew on written responses that former president George Bush provided to their questions. Their research is meticulously documented in a lengthy set of endnotes (pages 479-520), thus enhancing the book's credibility. The text is further enhanced by thirteen detailed and clearly drawn maps that illuminate many aspects of the war: the Iraqi air defense system, coalition force deployment and movement, locations of oil fields, and more. Also included are photographs of many of the senior leaders involved in the war.The book is full of fascinating details about many aspects of the war. The authors discuss the participation of various coalition forces in the campaign, as well as the diplomatic activities involving the USSR, Egypt, and other nations. Also discussed are friendly fire incidents and Iraqi POWs. I was particularly interested in the many details about the military hardware used by both coalition and Iraqi forces; the authors cover aircraft, naval vessels, sea and land mines, mine-clearing gear, tanks, and more. There are some really noteworthy battle scenes; particularly vivid is a description of a tank battle between U.S. and Iraqi forces--\"an impressive tableau of destruction.\"Gordon and Trainor are pointedly critical of many aspects of the conduct of the war. They discuss examples of rivalry and poor coordination between the different branches of the U.S. military, and also criticize the French and the Saudis. But the strongest and most sustained criticism is directed at General Norman Schwarzkopf. The authors assess both his command style and planning of the war and ultimately fault him for failing to achieve true joint warfare. The book places a heavy emphasis on the battle of Khafji; the authors discuss this engagement in detail and criticize both Schwarzkopf and General Colin Powell for failing to grasp its lessons.Gordon and Trainor note that the Persian Gulf War was \"a laboratory for the American military's new weapons and fighting doctrines.\" This well-written book vividly shows how hardware, tactics, diplomatic concerns, and personalities came together in the fighting of this war. This is a valuable addition to the military history of the late 20th century.",

                "review/text": "Bernard Trainor presents two key arguments in this book that are worthy of consideration. One is that the USMC learned early on in the battle for Kafji that the Iraqi army was a house of cards, but Gen. Swartzkopf either ignored or missed that message and in any event never got the word to VII Corp commander Gen. Franks to position his troops for a battle of pursuit. As a result a large portion of the Republican guard were able to escape the VII Corp left hook. The second key argument in this book is that Colin Powell the author of the so-called &quot;Weinburger Doctrine&quot; which argued for the use of US forces only when victory is assured and when backed by the will of the American people, urged George Bush to call a premature end to the war which allowed the Republican Guard to participate in crushing the Shi'ite rebellion occuring within earshot of US troops. Trainor is sometimes a little too critical of decisions made in the heat of battle and far too USMC-centric but he is an outstanding student of war. I highly reccommend this book.",

However, as an avid reader and student of military history, I feel the conclusions or the judgements by the authors of the commanders are a bit off and unfair. At times it comes off as a hatchet job.In one example, the overall plan or objective to destroy the Iraqi Republican Guard did not succeed as well as hoped. But, it was not at the fault of the planners or those fighting the battles. Bottom line - we prepared for the worst case scenario and got the best. With the left hook in motion, the Marines and the Army Tiger Brigade were to attack basically head on. The two events that occurred greatly in our favor to minimize casualties also caused the objective of destroying the Republican Guard to not be fully achieved.First, the Iraqi soldiers gave up in numbers greater than ever expected. In many cases, it wasn't a fight. Second, partly because of the first, the Marines and the Tiger Brigade blew through their objectives so fast, the left hook barely had time to materialize.There is something for everyone to remember when reading any book about the Gulf War. The intent of the major commanders was to minimize casualties. I'm thankful that they were a part of the Viet Nam fighting (if one can actually be thankful for such), because it instilled a common goal among each one of them, including Schwarzkopf, Powell, Horner and Franks to name a few.To achieve the objective as planned would mean the casualties resulting from the expected heavier fighting would have had to occur. Our light casualties verses the full achievement of the objectives? That's a no brainer.",

                "review/text": "Gordon and Trainor have written what is mostly a very readable and very well put together book about the first Gulf War. Students of history should be so lucky to get a book like this on the most recent conflict in the Gulf in a few years time.The book weaves political and military decisions together seemlessly, and discusses how political considerations did hamper the war effort, in contrast to the line from Washington that the civilians let the generals do all the planning.Colin Powell does not come out well in this book at all, nor does Gen. Schwartzkopf. The two authors prove that Powell in contrast to his media image at the time, was an extremely reluctant warrior and then wanted to make sure that the US forces did whatever it took to not sustain casualties. Reading this after the second Gulf conflict, one gets a sense of why Powell is Secretary of State and not Secretary of Defense, he seems to have a much better grasp of politics than he does of war. In the book, Schwartzkopf remarks bluntly that Powell does not have the stomach for war, and from what Trainor and Gordon detail, it looks like he is right.The current value for students of history and not just students of military history and tactics, however, lies in the fact that the Air Force wanted all along in the first Gulf war to topple the Hussein regime and made that a priority, only to have the other services and the civilians in the Bush administration such as Powell and Baker, push that consideration aside. The end of the book details war plans that were even drawn up and immediately classified by an outraged Washington that the field commanders even thought of this, to go to Baghdahd and topple Hussein.The book is also remarkably instructive on how the US managed to get hoodwinked by Hussein into letting him fly helos anywhere he wanted in Iraq and also not using the occupied oil fields as a bargaining chip because Powell and Schwartzkopf wanted to get out so quickly. Schwartzkopf's failures as a commander in decentralizing his command so much also led to the military not ever understanding the significance of the Battle of Kafji and the Iraqi army's horrible state. If Schwartzkopf had understood the battle's significance, the US and its allies could have possibly destroyed much of the Iraqi Republican Guard much more thoroughly and faster.Things were so disorganized at the end of the war, the Bush administration failed to even give Schwartzkopf guidance on the terms of the cease fire. All of these mistakes leaving Hussein in power with a military able to suppress internal dissent, and the US to get into a long running needless battle over sanctions and inspections that culminated in the most recent Gulf conflict. If the Bush administration and CENTCOM had done their jobs in the first Gulf war, Hussein would have been gone over a decade ago and Iraq rebuilt.This is a great book, however, it's horribly edited. There are several misspelled words with many of the chapters having the same passages repeated a few pages apart, especially in the conclusion of each chapter. A better editor should have caught those mistakes and told the authors that the reader didn't need to have something defined to them twice in three pages, and didn't need passages repeated verbatim in the conclusion.",

                "review/text": "This book provides an excellent view into much of the political and military decision-making that occurred during the first Gulf War. Gordon and Trainor's prose flows smoothly in this historical account of the war and this, along with many interesting vignettes mixed in, make the book easy to read. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning not only more about the first conflict in the Gulf, but also those wanting insight into how the planning and execution of such an operation is complex and riddled with political battles.Beginning their narrative shortly before Iraq invades Kuwait, the authors show that while some within the CIA were concerned with Iraqi troop developments near the Kuwaiti border, most in the Bush Administration were unconcerned about the possibility that Hussein would challenge the U.S. in the region. The ambiguous communiqu&eacute;s exchanged between Iraq and the U.S. are briefly mentioned, including the infamous Glaspie memo. What the Bush administration failed to realize, was how desperate Iraq's situation would become due to their failing economy and continued large military expenditures. This combination created \"an explosive relationship\" according to Gordon and Trainor.After the Iraqis seize Kuwait, the book turns to its most interesting section-the decisions of where and how many forces to deploy and what to do with the forces once in place. After scrambling to receive approval from the Saudis to station troops in their territory, debate began to center around whether U.S. forces should protect Saudi Arabia or attempt to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Powell favored only protecting the Saudis, while Eagleburger believed the U.S. should seek to remove the Iraqis. This first quibble over the role of the U.S. forces was only one of many to occur throughout the conflict between decision-makers at all levels.Once it was decided Kuwait was to be liberated, the next hot topic was how to use the forces in the Gulf most effectively. In the U.S. command debate swirled over how to use the air and ground forces. Unsurprisingly, the Air Force asserted the war could be won solely through the use of air power while the Army and Marines thought a ground offensive would be necessary. Pentagon official, John Warden, pitched his revolutionary war plan to CINC commander Norman Schwartzkopf. Warden's plan involved striking at the heart of Iraq's command and control center-Baghdad. Rather than bombard Iraqi ground troops with an endless stream of firepower, Warden proposed going straight to what he called the \"inner ring\" of Iraq's military power and targeting electrical, radar, communication, and other installations critical to Saddam's ability to disseminate orders to subordinates. Unlike Vietnam where air power provided support for ground forces, Warden's plan involved knocking out key pillars of the Iraqi military machine with the hope that it would collapse on itself. Warden's plan was tweaked several times over to accommodate other branches and military officials but the basic framework stayed in place-Iraq would be weakened through a systematic air campaign aimed at Baghdad before a ground war would begin.With the air strategy firmly in place, work began on identifying potential targets. As the U.S. gathered intelligence on exactly what types of equipment the Iraqis possessed, they began to realize two things: 1) they were unsure about the quality of the hardware the Iraqis had and 2) the massive military buildup undertaken during the Reagan administration had neglected a few areas that might become crucial during the Gulf War. Hussein had managed to cobble together a formidable regional force through arms sales mainly from the Soviets, French, and Chinese. The U.S. was uncertain how good the Iraqi air defenses were, how effectively the Iraqis could use it, and how U.S. stealth technology and radar jamming techniques would perform against it.The U.S. was not only uneasy because the stealth technology was untested but because other areas of the military had been neglected during the Reagan era build-up. Obsessed with technology, the Reagan buildup did an excellent job of developing high-tech weapons (stealth, Tomahawk cruise missles, etc.) but passed over smaller, more minor upgrades but upgrades that were still important. Two cases illustrate this point. First, only Air Force planes had two systems of independently identifying aircraft as friend-from-foe. Since it was a rule of engagement that U.S. planes had to have two independent identifications, the Navy could not engage what it believed (rightly) were two Iraqi war jets trailing U.S. planes returning from bombing raids. Another example involves the radio technology possessed by the Army. Instead of modern radios, the Army pilots had antiquated radios that had been held over from the Vietnam era. The radios were still operable but also gave away the position of the user. When two Army pilots were forced to eject over Iraq, the Iraqis eventually captured them in part because their radio transmissions were traceable.With the air phase humming along, planning for a ground invasion continued. Again, there were battles over which ground forces would carry out which missions. The Army had planned to enter the western part of Iraq, storm toward Baghdad, and cut off the supply lines of the Iraqi forces in Kuwait. The Marines' role would be to push the Iraqi army out of Kuwait and into the Army, which would have gathered a full head of steam and deliver the knock-out punch. The Marines became upset because they felt undermanned to charge into Kuwait only to have the Army swoop in and steal the glory by finishing off the Iraqis. Why do they have to do the dirty work and get none of the credit? Partners within the coalition also had to be accommodated. The Saudis insisted on helping push back Iraqi forces that had crossed the Saudi border as a matter of pride. Britain wanted a prominent role in the ground war and France also wanted to conduct a significant number of sorties. All were woven into the battle plan, even if the plan had to be altered in ways that were thought detrimental to success.With the concerns of the services and allies adequately assuaged, the ground war was finally set to begin. The Marines moved into Kuwait and after some intense initial resistance, had the Iraqis on the run. The only problem was the Marines' effort had been too successful. They Iraqis retreated quickly enough that the Army did not reach a position to deliver its \"left hook\" to the fleeting Iraqi forces. Since the U.S. had been so effective in the ground phase, Powell and Schwartzkopf began to lobby the president with the idea that the fighting should end soon and the U.S. should scale back in the region to prevent anti-American sentiment. Both Powell and Schwartzkopf believed that plowing through Baghdad and deposing Saddam Hussein would be costly in terms of casualties. They argued the mission had been accomplished-Kuwait had been liberated.",

Marvin Yancey -- short, fat, over forty, sloppy, sycophantic, cowardly -- is the most unlikely recruit at a Virginia training camp during World War II. He is called a bootlicker and a toady to the army system, which he is, and all the men in his platoon find him disgusting. Yancey's upset of well-planned military maneuvers by overseeing a party that becomes an orgy and by spinning a laundry unit askew are some the novel's funniest moments.

        "description": "On Thermonuclear War was controversial when originally published and remains so today. It is iconoclastic, crosses disciplinary boundaries, and finally it is calm and compellingly reasonable. The book was widely read on both sides of the Iron Curtain and the result was serious revision in both Western and Soviet strategy and doctrine. As a result, both sides were better able to avoid disaster during the Cold War. The strategic concepts still apply: defense, local animosities, and the usual balance-of-power issues are still very much with us. Kahn's stated purpose in writing this book was simply: \"avoiding disaster and buying time, without specifying the use of this time.\" By the late 1950s, with both sides H-bomb-armed, reason and time were in short supply. Kahn, a military analyst at Rand since 1948, understood that a defense based only on thermonuclear arnaments was inconceivable, morally questionable, and not credible. The book was the first to make sense of nuclear weapons. Originally created from a series of lectures, it provides insight into how policymakers consider such issues. One may agree with Kahn or disagree with him on specific issues, but he clearly defined the terrain of the argument. He also looks at other weapons of mass destruction such as biological and chemical, and the history of their use. The Cold War is over, but the nuclear genie is out of the bottle, and the lessons and principles developed in On Thermonuclear War apply as much to today's China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as they did to the Soviets.",

He does this in the only way it can be done-in a dispassionate way. He asks such questions as to whether civilization can survive a nuclear war and if so how long it would take for it to recover.His conclusion based on the facts and technology of the time he wrote the book (1962) was that nuclear war was winnable. Detractors of the book saw it as advocating nuclear war which is far from the truth. How easy it is to shoot the messenger.From many accounts of Kahn the man he was far from bloodless and he was in fact optimistic about the future.As one reads this book one enters into the mind of a great thinker. He was a highly logical man who dared to take on a problem others saw as taboo. Some may not like the way he deals with the subject but as long as we possess nuclear weapons the problems and all of their ramifications must be considered.A frightening yet interesting read.Jim Connell \"Hallstatt Prince\"",

There are no sentimental biases or hidden agendas - it's so refreshing to read something which just sticks to the facts and tells the story as it is. As an Australian of part Serbian heritage I totally understood the &quot;mentality&quot; that Stankovic tried to convey, he did it so well, but unfortunatly I think this &quot;mentality&quot; is so foreign to your average westerner that a lot of the true gems of this book would be lost on them. Nonetheless, Stankovic has attempted to articulate it, and once you understand this &quot;mentality&quot; that drives the people of the Balkans, you will start to see why this war happened. That is not to justify the horrors of the last ten years in any way, shape or form - but I feel that this innate understanding of the &quot;mentality&quot; is what is perhaps lacking from most books on the subject.It's a great read. Stankovic has portrayed the nitty gritty reality of the war in Bosnia, and provides an insight into the lives of the &quot;little people&quot; and the behind-the-scenes players that we otherwise never hear about because it's not newsworthy enough, or won't fit into someone's colour-by-numbers view of what is going over there... Or quite simply does not suit whoever's agenda.This book is an important read for anyone with a serious interest in recent Balkan history. After being falsely slapped with charges of espionage and his military career in tatters, Stankovic has written a probably the best and most important book on the Bosnian war.

Several outstanding books exist for the fighting on the Golan at the Syrian front and I highly recommend the books by Avigdor Kahalani and Raful Eitan. For a general overview of the war including both fronts, I recommend Chaim Herzog's \"The War for Atonement.\" However, \"On the Banks of the Suez\" has no equal for explaining the action on the Egyptian front.Some of the many reasons that make this a great book are:1. PROFESSIONAL MILITARY WRITING: A military professional wrote this book for other military professionals. Many authors have a tendency to remove military language and viewpoints to simplify the text for popular review. Bren Adan resisted doing that although he did write the book in as lucid and clear a method as is possible without \"dumbing down\" the work.2. IMPARTIAL CRITICISM: The book, while written by an Israeli general, is impartial. He doesn't hesitate to critique the fighting by either the Egyptians or the Israelis. In fact, he criticizes the Israeli actions much more so than those of the Egyptians combatants. There, of course, are some of his personal opinions and some discussions of the political factors, but Adan avoids overly moralizing history and instead presents it for the reader's review.3. LITTLE TO NO INTELLIGENCE \"BLUR\": One of the shortcomings of many books written about the 1973 Yom Kippur war in the first five to ten years after the war is the editing that IDF spokespeople did to the information released about the war. For security's sake, they often change unit names and other critical date making it difficult to track whom was where and when. Adan, being intimately aware of such restrictions, was able to write this book without having his writing made confusing.4. EXCITING ACCOUNTS OF THE ACTION: Adan holds no punches describing the action and successes of the fighters on both sides. I particularly enjoyed his accounts of the tough fighting by Egyptians commandos in the beginning of the war. The Israeli tankers, on the other hand, were tenacious dedicated fighters as well.5. INSIGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF NONCOMBAT FACTORS: Adan describes very well what's is going on in the background of the war: the superpower struggle, ineffective UN mediation, political factors in both the Egyptian and Israeli government, as well as the effect of the civilians behind the lines.I highly recommend this incredibly well written book to anyone interested in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. I particularly recommend it to military professionals.Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan",

                "review/text": "There exist very few books on the Yom Kippur War. 'No Victory No vanquished' is a useless account written just after the war. 'The war of Atonement' by Herzog is informative. 'Yom Kippur War' by the london insight team is slightly biased against Israel but very informative. 'Two O'clock war' by Boyne is totally americanized and does not have a good grasp on Israel. This read by General 'Bren' Adan is the most professorial of the books and one of the most dry but also most informative in regards to the SOuthern front.Adan found himself and his unit facing the brunt of the arab attack along the canal in the first days of the fighting. he lost 1/3 or more of his tanks in a wasted counterattack during the second day of the conflict. But although wounded his unit went on to cross the canal and take vengeance upon the Egyptians. This authoritative account is critical of the role of Sharon and commends 'Dado' for his original counterattack plan that was subsequently changed by Gonen.An interesting account of Israeli arms in a time of crises. the new book by Blum 'Eve of Destruction' is a much easier read but does not contain the detail of this dry account of the war by one of its cheif participants.",

The book tells the tale of two brothers growing up in a poor but suportive home environment, which gets progressivly worse after the death of their father. It shows how the local gentry could force those without resourses to do as they were instructed. This conflict between the gentry and the working classes is one of the main motive forces in the story. Michael Morpurgo shows how ultimatly the older brothers refusal to be broken in spirit led to his undoing. A very well written and enjoyable book, not just for young adults. Its a book that speaks up for those soldiers who were put to death by the the officer corp of the British Army.A final thought on this topic; Back in 1997 Tony Blair seeking election as the next Prime Minister made an election promise to give posthumous pardons to these men. to date he still has not delivered on this promise.OK so in the end Blair came through with the pardon when he was needing a boost the polls just before an election if memory serves.",

                "review/text": "Private Peaceful has a very interesting premise: Set against the backdrop of World War One, we follow brothers Charlie and Tommo as they grow up and subsequently enlist in Britain's army to fight the Hun. Each chapter begins sometime during a very long night as Tommo remembers all the adventures and trials he and his family endured together. Morpurgo does an excellent job of building suspense as we learn slowly that Tommo is dreading the coming of morning, though the reason is unclear until late in the book. By then, we are so emotionally vested in this story that the realization of what's coming is devastating.Private Peaceful (Peaceful is the family name) is a short book that packs a wallop of emotion. However, at times Morpurgo doesn't move the story along as quickly as I'd like, though of course war itself is like that. Tommo doesn't waver in his commitments, whether to his brothers, his soldiering, or his love for his brother's wife; it's this love for Molly that I found immature on his part. The brothers are realistic in their devotion to each other, and Morpurgo is skilled in bringing us to the climax that tests those bonds.Overall I enjoyed this book, though I felt it might have done a little better with Tommo being less focused on his own feelings. The book would make a great addition to a history teacher's repetoire; it illustrates the devastation of trench warfare and the unrealistic notions of young men enlisting to fight an unknown enemy. Ultimately packing a powerful punch, this is indeed a book I find easy to recommend.",

These books are a historical companion to each major war in the nineteenth and twentieth century. The fate of soldiers, battalions, armies, can change in the blink of an eye-with this comprehensive book readers can follow the conflicting sides in their strategy, weaponry, and policies. World War II Day by Day is a chronological history of the second World War from the beginning of the Polish campaign in September 1939 to the surrender of Japan in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945. All the major war theaters are covered, as is the fighting in the air and the sea. The dated entries, which are written as though they have just happened, thereby recapturing the immediacy of the war, analyze the major battles and campaigns of the war, such as Stalingrad, Kursk, Midway, D-Day, Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Berlin. Accompanying the entries in World War II Day by Day are longer features on various aspects of the conflict, such as the war's decisive weapons, strategic decisions, and policies. There are also biographical entries on the individuals who shaped and prosecuted the war in both Europe and the Pacific theaters: leaders such as Chamberlain, Stalin, Zhukov, MacArthur, Hitler, Manstein, and Eisenhower.",

You can glance through the pages and have a decent thumbnail sketch of what happened in any month of the war. This makes the war years understandable without wading through a million books.The layout is similar to news releases, so each page looks like a newspaper (although they are not authentic newspaper articles).It must have taken years to compile this book.

For example whole Battle for Moscow is not even mentioned, even though it was one of the first most important military operations on the territory of USSR in fall/winter of 1941 and Germans were stopped just 30km from their goal. Winter comes after summer (no fall in 1941 in this book :-) Chapter on Stalingrad does not describe even remotely the true proportions of that battle and author's own analysis of these events are strange to say the least. Siege of Leningrad is mentioned, but so briefly. I mean c'mon, 1 500 000 people starved to death but did not surrender...Also I find it almost offensive how cold the author talks about sufferings and hardship of civilian population. This whole war was such a horrible tragedy and should be presented like one. To understand better history and horror of WWII I recommend \"The Unknown War\" movie if you can find a copy together with some better book to follow chronology. Almost completely put together from documentary pieces from war time archive this movie will show you real people going through real events. You will not be able to look at World War II as \"another war\" anymore or think about military action without understanding how much suffering was behind every and each one of them.All in all some material is presented very well, but with huge gaps authors left uncovered I find it hard to recommend.

        "description": "A novel that seamlessly blends military intrigue, relentless suspense, and a baffling mystery, The Advocate is a harrowing account by two master storytellers who dare to imagine what can really happen in the fire of war, where good and evil aren't always what they seem. Here one man must pierce the military's impenetrable wall of silence to prove that even in the midst of a world war, murder is still a crime. The Advocate On a chalky bluff overlooking the windswept English Channel, an old man watches a horrifying spectacle unfold. Within a matter of seconds, one American P-47 Thunderbolt fires on another, mercilessly driving the crippled plane into the sea. And the old man, his cottage strafed, barely escapes with his life. The year is 1943: The Russians have defeated Hitler at Stalingrad. North Africa has fallen to the Allies. And the Americans, after two disastrous years, are winning the war in the Pacific. Now, in England, American fliers wage a bitter air war against the Luftwaffe. But what really happened in the skies above the Channel is something no one--least of all the military--is prepared to have revealed. To find out the truth, the Judge Advocate's office calls on a brilliant, cynical, homesick lawyer. The last thing Harry Voss wanted was a case that had every indication of becoming a political powder keg. But Harry, a man of honor, cannot turn his back on the possibility that the incident over the Channel may not have been an accident--but an act of cold-blooded murder. Harry has no idea what he is getting into. For his investigation will lead through a labyrinth of military politics, where ambitious, powerful men guard their turf and soldiers guard their secrets with an unbreakable code of silence. For Harry, the case becomes his own personal war, as he uncovers a series of murderous events that detonate up the chain of command. He only wants justice for a crime. And he is willing to risk his own career and life to get it, as he begins a dangerous journey into the dark heart of war. It is here that Harry Voss will dare to enter a world where heroes are killers, wrong becomes right, and even angels must dip their wings into the fire of hell itself From the Hardcover edition.",

On their return home, one of the fighters shot down a single engine plane in an apparent friendly fire incident. A shepherd and his wife watched the event until the pilot notices them and tries to kill them too.Colonel Joseph Ryan assigns his friend Lieutenant Harry Voss to investigate the accident. Harry goes to the scene of the incident where he learns from the shepherd and his wife what they saw. Harry also notices that the film on the nose of the plane is missing and believes one of the two survivors destroyed it. Soon one of the men confesses to killing his peers, but Harry observes discrepancies in the story, as if he is hiding something. A superior officer tells Harry to back off, but the tenacious officer continues to make inquiries even if it costs him his career.World War II fans will get a feel for the way it was for a Yankee stationed in England during the Big One. Readers learn that there is quite a difference between allies and friends. THE ADVOCATE provides a look inside the armed forces community especially policing and passing judgment on one of their own.

Here -- for the first time in one volume -- is the chronicle of the United States Army's dramatic mobilization and stunning march to victory in World War II. In a lively and engrossing narrative that spans theaters of operations around the world, Geoffrey Perret tells how the Army was drafted, trained, organized, armed, and led at every stage of the war. Beginning with the prescient military planners of the 1930s, he offers vivid warts-and-all profiles of the farsighted commanders who would lead the way, men like Marshall, MacArthur, Eisenhower, Ridgway, Bradley, and Patton. Drawing heavily on important new source material in major archives throughout the United States, THERE'S A WAR TO BE WON offers new insights into the wartime Army, its commanders, and its battles.

The structure of the book is conceptual instead of chronological. The parts of the book that are not stories of the battles but istead tell the behind-the-scenes of Army practicce are the best. In these we get to see the Army develop under the watchful farsighted eye of Marshall, the book's hero. Perret does the best job I have ever read on how the Army stepped back and looked at war as a whole. When you see just how much innovation took place in the inter-war period, you see how easily we could have lost WWII without it.The book is run on biography, like all good history. We get to see the personalities behind the events. Perret surely has his favorites. Marshall, Truscott, Frederick, Bradley, &amp; Ridgway can do no wrong, MacArthur, Montgomery, and Brooke can do no right, and Eisenhower, Patton, Churchill, and Roosevelt come in the middle.The biographies are the first inkling of the big flaw in this book. Perret is too much a cheerleader for the Army. Compare how he writes about the repple-depples (he doesn't even use the derogatory term) and how Stephen Ambrose writes about them in Citizen Soldiers. The difference is night and day: Perret glosses over flaws, Ambrose is honest about them. It is so blatantly obvious that Perret wants to say that the Army did most everything right, and only when it's impossible to hide the flaws will he grudgingly admit to them. CBI is another example--here he manages to blame the problems on individuals, not Army policy. This is why this book only gets 3 stars: you're never quite sure if such-and-such really happened or if it is just spin.",

                "review/text": "In &quot;There's A War To Be Won&quot;, the author gives a broad overview of the development and growth of the US Army during the 1930's and 40's, as well as its remarkable combat performance during the war. It is an amazing story, considering that in the late 1930's the army consisted of 100,000 poorly equipped soldiers led by superannuated generals and junior officers who had little hope of promotion past the rank of captain during a normal army career.Mr Perret's focus is not to give the reader a blow-by-blow history of the US Army in WWII, a mission already splendidly accomplished by the army's own historians in their multivolume postwar colossus. Instead, he provides a broad overview of the planners and leaders, like George C. Marshall and FDR, whose devotion to duty and to the army they served during 1930's and 40's prepared the army and the nation for the trial and ultimate victory that lay ahead. Mr Perret effectively debunks the popular myth that the US Army's victory was due simply to overwhelming material abundance, and correctly ascribes it to the courage and tenacity of the American soldier.In addition to the broader panorama, Mr Perret turns his attention to specific vignettes that provide insight about army strategy, tactics and organization, as mentioned in the editorial review accompanying the book description above. I found the chapters on logistics and on the fate of the killed and wounded especially interesting and illustrative.All in all, one of the best general-interest books about the US Army in WWII that I have read, and one that will whet the reader's appetite to know more. (Along this vein I highly recommend Cray's one-volume bio of George Marshall as well as Rhodes' &quot;Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot;). I am very sad to have discovered recently (during a reorganization of my bookshelves) that I have misplaced my copy; and that the book is now out of print.",

What happened to battlefield casualties (both wounded and dead), what happens to POWs, how medals were distributed, how the Army developed it's dreaded artillery fire method, how C-rations were created. In fact, I can't really think of anything that Perret didn't cover.I disagree with the reviewer who said the book was &quot;spin.&quot; It's the superior force makes the enemy fight on his terms, not on those of the opponent. The fact stands that time and time again, the U.S. Army forced its German and Japanese enemies to fight on its choosing, not theirs.My only gripe about the book is the notes. They are lumped into the back of the book and there isn't a bibliography. Had these been added, I think that it would have made a great book even better.I will let Perret conclude for me:&quot;The German Army of World War II has many admirers and defenders. 'No one has ever met them on their terms ever defeated them' is how Eric Larrabee, who fought in North Africa puts it. Larrabee is absolutely right. At the same time, it is equally true that no one who met the U.S. Army of World War II on ITS terms ever defeated it either.&quot;",

What was fascinating to learn was that, as late as 1940, the U.S. Army was ranked below that of Portugal. Through reading this book, the reader sees how it was through the foresight of people like George C. Marshall and other fine soldiers such as Matthew Ridgway, Maxwell Taylor, Bradley, Eisenhower, and Patton, that the U.S. was able to develop, by 1944 and 1945, one of the finest armies in the history of the world.What is also really good about this book is the insight Perret provides about the ordinary GI and the distinguished service provided by Black combat units, such as the 969th Field Artillery Battalion, the 761st Tank Battalion (which served continuously in combat longer than any other U.S. tank battalion in Europe), the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion, and the 92nd Infantry Division.I highly recommend this book.

He really dives into the story like few other authors. Some of his conclusions are different than most, but he explains his reasoning very well.So many authors try to explain military battles like they were sports games. Battles are far more complex than a simple football game. Mr. Perret does a great job of walking the reader through some of the complexities of battle. He covers things that few authors takes time to cover. He talks about how what was talked about in the classrooms of CGSC at Ft. Leavenworth shaped the commanders that fought the war. Mr. Perret takes time to explain how Marshall set up a system to crank out divisions off of the training line much like Ford created cars.Almost every battle the Army fought is covered by the author, some in great detail, some battles were covered in passing. He naturally covers the big battles like D-Day but also gives good coverage of the campaign in Italy, Sicily, North Africa, and with McArthur's troops in the Pacific. He even talks about the forgotten men McArthur left in 42 who were seemingly forgotten by history after that. Mr Perrret does a good job to explain the tactics, and strategy of the war. He doesn't forget the ever important logistics of the war from the war production board in Washington down to the supply Sgt. on the battlefield.The author also gives the reader a little color with the story. He does mention the unique personalities at various levels that helped bring about the victory.This book is a great book to make a novice into a history expert in short time.",

What I will do is give Mr. Perret allocades for the best single volume treatment of how the US Army prepared and won a two front war on the ground and in the air.While others might quibble that he does not take to task the organizations and personalities sufficiently for their failures, I do not. I see this book as cutting though all the \"fog\" and presenting the non-historian with an entertaining and well organized presentation of the years leading up to and during the war. I have read the book several times....The reader will come away with a greater appreciation of just how lucky the U.S. was to have done as well as we did. In large measure the Army's success was a result of retaining the best and the brightest leaders and strategists at a time they were needed.Shrewd choices in weapons development, and program management also paved the way to victory by allowing the US Army to become the only truly mechanized army in the world (despite what the popular history books would tell you about the Wehrmacht), possess the largest air force ever in existence, develop the nuclear bomb, and supply and maintain 93 divisions (larger and better equiped than the brigade sized divisions fielded by both the Soviets and Germans) on two fronts on separate sides of the globe.This book is a great introduction to the history of the US Army in WWII.

                "review/text": "Here are the basic facts: In WWII, the US Army was outnumbered by two to one in each theater of operations. The mathematics of movement meant that there would be places where the numbers would be over five to one. It would be taking the offensive against prepared forces, which should require a superiority of between three to one and five to one. It was inexperienced, which should have been the equivalent of a three to one disadvantage. (It turned seven million men into soldiers in less than five years.) And it fought at the end of the longest supply lines ever seen in war. Yet this force lost only one engagement--its first. It won its second engagement, and its third, and its one hundreth, and more beyond that. History records many great commanders and armies, but none come near to this.How did such an army fight? How was it created? WHY did it win? Today we know the immense advantage given by ULTRA. But that alone cannot explain how the army managed to sustain itself, nor how its soldiers fought outnumbered and won in contact between small units.This book attempts to explain the success of the US Army of WWII. Chapter by chapter, it explains what was done, what worked, and what didn't. Each chapter is a story in itself, and bit by bit the picture is filled in: The rifle that took forty years to develop and was ready just in time, the invention of the obstacle course, the general who spent his family fortune on gasoline so his tanks could practice maneuvers, how the Army stretched the world's first direct-dial long distance system across Europe--and how a logistics expert nearly sank the whole war.No book can tell the whole story of WWII, or even of one army. And, as other reviewers have noted, not every failure is recorded, nor are all the failures described given a full analysis. But the story of the USA in WWII isn't a story of failure. It is a story of success, a success so total that it is hard to believe today that it was ever in doubt. But it was in doubt. This army had to triumph over the enemy. It had to triumph over the Great Depression. And, as the numbers show, it had to triumph over history. It did.Perret's prose is direct, his progression as logical as possible. He does not shrink from the ugliness of war, whether death, disease, or foul-mouthed commanders. Nor does he avoid the brighter colors: the story is often inspiring and recurring themes pull the self-contained chapters together into a unified whole.This book should be required reading for every high school senior.",

                "review/text": "The author, and this book, may well be among the strongest elements of what I perceive to be a growing backlash against the prevalent technophelia characteristic of the military-industrial complex that President and General Eisenhower warned us against--a technophelia that advocates a &quot;system of systems&quot; with no provision for strategy, doctrine, or intelligence; and a Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that looks to micro-UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) and robotic ants as the primary means for defeating any enemy. We will simply assume every enemy will conveniently expose themselves to the narrow range of capabilities that we have devised at great expense!The author provides as good a review of &quot;friction&quot; in war and in policy as one could hope for. Although sometimes tedious and not always easy to follow, this book is a must for any serious scholar of future conflicts between states, nations, and organizations. Above all, this book is a giant compressed Castor Oil pill for the techno-meisters so eager to believe they can shape a world where our money and our technology can overcome every obstacle and every opponent.A few highlights intended to recommend the purchase of this book and its digestion:1) Friction is not receiving the attention it merits from modern social scientists, including all those on the Department of Defense payroll. We still conceptualize our capabilities along techno-rational lines instead of human-normal chaos lines.2) It is the combination of thoughtful doctrine, individual and unit discipline, initiative at all levels, and good intelligence (individual, organic, and external) that leads to victory through the reduction of friction--what General Alfred M. Gray, former Commandant of the Marine Corps institutionalized with his concept of &quot;commander's intent&quot; on top of training for war with the assumption that communications and computing *will* collapse in the heat of battle.3) Although very brief in his coverage of intelligence per se, the author is helpful in reviewing Clausewitz's top eight sources of friction, the first three of which deal with information: insufficient knowledge of the enemy; unreliable information from patrols and spies; and uncertain knowledge of our own capabilities and dispositions. The author administers the coup de grace to technophiles with some elegant quotes from these worthies claiming that the new world of satellite intelligence is taking us to a non-Clauswitzian world where friction can be overcome by &quot;information superiority&quot;--these are the same folks that cannot find Bin Laden and had to invade Panama in order to capture Noriega--the same folks that let a warlord in Somalia run amok and let a small crowd chase away a U.S. Navy ship of war from docking in Haiti...the same folks that ignore 18 distinct genocide campaigns on-going today, with all that implies in terms of forced migration and epidemic disease and failed states and rampant destabilizing crime.4) The author's review of groupthink (Janis) and how this leads to policy fiasco's is very worthwhile, not only because it is acutely relevant to how we are making decisions today in defense, energy, health, and fiscal policy, but because it highlights so clearly the dangers that come from a leadership that thinks it is invulnerable, morally superior, self-censored, sharing illusions of unanimity, subject to stereotyped visions of the world, and--worst of all--protected from reality by self appointed &quot;mind guards&quot; who put direct pressure on &quot;deviant&quot; naysayers (or dump them from the team).5) The author is one of the few to focus on the impact of friction on what Clausewitz calls the ultimate disconnect, that between ends and means in war. As America prepares to rethink its military force structure, it is especially appropriate to note that we are planning to downsize the conventional forces while investing heavily in electronic capabilities, at the same time that the most advanced thinkers have moved beyond asymmetric war to non-traditional soft power including major emphasis on disease control, water preservation, transnational law enforcement, and major diplomatic and economic assistance options. Looking at today's situation through the author's eyes and this book, one can see that we do not have a strategy; we don't even try to understand what everyone else's strategy might be; and we are completely ignoring the need to fully integrate home front and overseas defense, foreign affairs, and trade strategy and capabilities management.Over the course of 7 chapters, the author reviews friction both at the policy/acquisition level and the operational level of command, in relation to irrelevant and inflexible war plans; nuclear crisis management; within Desert Storm; in small wars, &quot;faux wars&quot; and peace operations; in modern deterrence; and in relation to mass destruction and information warfare paradigms. In the latter instance, he is acutely sensitive to the teachings of Dr. Steve Blank, that one man's information &quot;warning&quot; attack is another man's signal for &quot;total war&quot;--witness Russian doctrine that considers a C4I attack to be fundamental and requiring an immediate &quot;dead hand&quot; retaliatory attack.The author concludes the book with a review of simple, compound, and complex friction in policy and operations, with examples, and for this section alone the book merits inclusion in any serious library concerned with international security.",

Taking friction to the level of politics and strategy is an excellent idea, and one that many politicians might learn from. I enjoyed the book, and found the review in the first chapters on the modern thought about friction to be quite helpful.The remainder of the book, though, rehashes themes that Cimbala has covered in significant depth in the past. He uses the examples of Russian war planning at the start of WWI, US/Soviet relations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and nuclear war planning to demonstrate how inflexible plans and thoughtless leaders can precipitate undesired wars. In this, the book is a simple repeat of his earlier book, Military Persuasion.Cimbala does include two thoughful chapters that expand his earlier themes and contribute to the study of friction in modern, information driven conflicts: one on NATO action in Kosovo, and one on the Gulf War of 1991. Both chapters are useful and highlight his thesis that war planning in the information age is just as susceptible to friction as it was 100 years ago.Overall, those interested in friction in policy decisions, or friction in information war will find the book useful. Those who have read some of Cimbala's other works can safely pass this one up.",

        "Title": "the silent war the cold war battle beneath the sea",
        "description": "The Cold War was the first major conflict between superpowers in which victory and defeat were unambiguously determined without the firing of a shot. Without the shield of a strong, silent deterrent or the intellectual sword of espionage beneath the sea, that war could not have been won. John P. Craven was a key figure in the Cold War beneath the sea. As chief scientist of the Navy's Special Projects Office, which supervised the Polaris missile system, then later as head of the Deep Submergence Systems Project (DSSP) and the Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle program (DSRV), both of which engaged in a variety of clandestine undersea projects, he was intimately involved with planning and executing America's submarine-based nuclear deterrence and submarine-based espionage activities during the height of the Cold War. Craven was considered so important by the Soviets that they assigned a full-time KGB agent to spy on him. Some of Craven's highly classified activities have been mentioned in such books as Blind Man's Bluff, but now he gives us his own insights into the deadly cat-and-mouse game that U.S. and Soviet forces played deep in the world's oceans. Craven tells riveting stories about the most treacherous years of the Cold War. In 1956 Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine and the backbone of the Polaris ballistic missile system, was only days or even hours from sinking due to structural damage of unknown origin. Craven led a team of experts to diagnose the structural flaw that could have sent the sub to the bottom of the ocean, taking the Navy's missile program with it. Craven offers insight into the rivalry between the advocates of deterrence (with whom he sided) and those military men and scientists, such as Edward Teller, who believed that the United States had to prepare to fight and win a nuclear conflict with the Soviet Union. He describes the argument that raged in the Navy over the reasons for the tragic loss of the submarine Thresher, and tells the astonishing story of the hunt for the rogue Soviet sub that became the model for The Hunt for Red October -- including the amazing discovery the Navy made when it eventually found the sunken sub. Craven takes readers inside the highly secret DSSP and DSRV programs, both of which offered crucial cover for sophisticated intelligence operations. Both programs performed important salvage operations in addition to their secret espionage activities, notably the recovery of a nuclear bomb off Palomares, Spain. He describes how the Navy's success at deep-sea recovery operations led to the takeover of the entire program by the CIA during the Nixon administration. A compelling tale of intrigue, both within our own government and between the U.S. and Soviet navies, The Silent War is an enthralling insider's account of how the submarine service kept the peace during the dangerous days of the Cold War.",

The earlier, Blind Man's Bluff, has a copyright date of 1998, while the more recent, The Silent War, has a copyright date of 2001. The authors of Blind Man's Bluff refer several times to John Craven, auther of The Silent War, while Craven refers to Blind Man's Bluff in several places, sometimes to question its analysis.The Silent War was written by one of the principles in submarine circles during the Cold War, John Craven. As such, he is in the paradoxical position of knowing more of the details than the authors of Blind Man's Bluff, while being bound by security regulations to say less. As a result, his book presents an interesting picture of the personalities involved, and an occasional interesting technical tidbit [two examples: big waves can be created on demand by driving a large ship at high speed - and turning it abruptly at the last second; materials have a critical temperature, below which they become brittle, rather than flexible.] - but less operational detail.The book is written in the first person and with a sense of excitement that one would expect from an author having lived through the experiences personally. Despite stumbling over an occasional clich&eacute; or misspelled word, the writing is competent to very good.Which to read? If you want to know what happened, I'd go for Blind Man's Bluff. Its content overcomes the better writing and sense of presence of The Silent Sea. If you want to know something about the people that made it happen, I'd go with The Silent War.",

Plus I knew who Craven was, knew what he'd meant to the Navy and knew he was current, so it was with great anticipation that I picked up his book.It was interesting enough, but still in the end I felt a little unfulfilled. My submarine career pretty much encompasses the second half and end of The Cold War, and I guess I expected to see a little more of me and my comrades in Craven's work which is subtitled, &quot;The Cold War Battle Beneath The Sea&quot;, accompanied by a dashing photo of a 688 class nuclear submarine on it's dustcover.Craven writes in great, sometimes scientific detail, about the various Navy and marine programs and investigations he was involved in. But there is not a lot discussion of actual operational submarining, in contrast to Sherry Sontag's and Christopher Drew's &quot;Blind Man's Bluff&quot;, and this may be where the reader gets mislead. There may be security reasons, or maybe operational submarine discussion of the period isn't interesting to anybody but us submariners who were there, but a reader looking for that will be disappointed.But there IS room for &quot;Blind Man's Bluff&quot; and &quot;The Silent War&quot; in your submarine library. While Sontag and Drew have taken a lot of flack for their book, it IS much more a story of the submarines, the crews, and the missions than anything else current. Craven writes from a much more &quot;above it all&quot; perspective and his topics and discussions deal more with their strategic impact on submarining, than with the actual submarining itself.The one REAL negative of Craven's work is his propensity for tooting his own horn and patting himself on the back.It starts at the very beginning and continues unabated throughout the book. The personality and demeanor that we see of him in all the television pieces on submarines, shines through on every page of the book. He did make an invaluable contribution to submarines, the Navy, and our nation, but he's gotta give us a break.Maybe if he'd titled his book, &quot;My Story&quot;, with a portrait of himself wearing a tiny little set of civilian dolphins, we would have been better prepared for what we were getting into.Gene Brockington, San Diego, California",

Though he avoids discussing some of the accounts found within &quot;Bluff,&quot; due to classification concerns, he does provide a number of details previously unpublished, as well as his unique insight into Cold War submarine operations.Some of his accounts are somewhat questionable, given contradictions with previously published accounts, which again, brings up his concerns over revealing sensitive information.The only thing lacking from the book is illustrations or pictures of any kind, which seems odd given the wealth of published images on the subject.

He is clearly a brilliant man with a tremendous amount to say -- too much of which has remained secret for too long. The truth about what was going on during the Cold War is beyond the wildest imagination of the most gifted of fiction writers; the fact that we were able to avoid open conflict with the Soviets is indeed a miracle. Craven's book, while a bit technical in the first few chapters, becomes a real page turner -- I couldn't put it down and finally reached the end around 3AM. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in submarines, the Cold War, military history or global politics.",

                "review/text": "I have read several stories about the cold war but I never seemed to get the big picture that I got from this book. I thought this was going to be a book mostly about submarine warfare. I was surprised at all of the other missions that were connected to special operations.It starts out and tries to explain the reasons for deterances and how to utilize them against an enemy. He seems to tell us in this part that we had to have enough to make the enemy take notice but not too much where they felt they had no choice but to make a first strike.The methods that he tells about next where, first the Polaris missile system the problems with the original missile and the benefits and problems of the fuels that they used. After the missile was successful Dr. Craven told about how the Polaris originally had one mega ton warhead and later they figured out how to use MIRVs for a greater deterrence. At this point he tells some personal information about how he got to be head of the program.The story then went into the loss of the Thresher and the possible causes but at this point the story changes and leaves submarines for deep submergence projects.First you learn about the deep submergence rescue vehicle but it is vague on what it does. If you saw the movie the Hunt for Red October you would have a better idea. Next you learn about Sealab I & II and all the problems they had there. I would not have thought that these were so clandestine if I had not read this book. At this point you learn about saturation diving and the problems and benefits of the programs.The next part is more interesting where you learn more about the submarines Seawolf, Whale and Halibut. The only problem is that I have learned more on the history channel than I have in this book because it does not talk about any specific missions. When it talks about the Trieste bathyscaphe the book only references it to talk about how they were going to use the Trieste II as a spy weapon.The fisherman's friend was an interesting story about the lost nuclear bomb and what the fisherman tried to get for that find. The book mention's what they had to do to recover it and what lessons they learned to increase their capabilities under the sea. This knowledge leads to the NR-1. This book does not talk much about the NR-1 if you want to read a good book on it read Lee Vyborny's account in Dark Waters: An Insider's account of the NR-1, the cold war's undercover nuclear sub. At this point he tells about how he had to deal with Rickover and the type of man that Craven thought he was.Craven follows this with the story of the two missing submarines and how they had to go and find them. I was surprise that they were able to pin point both of these subs with some acoustic recording from back in the early 70s. This was the most interesting part of the book when Dr. Craven thinks that the reason for the missing Soviet sub is that it was a rogue that was firing a missile at Hawaii but the fail safes caused an explosion and sunk the sub. I had never heard that story before.The remainder of the book describes the debacle of the Glomar Explorer, how this Soviet spy was after him for years and the ending of the cold war.I can recommend this book if you are looking of an overview of the political strategy used in our military during the cold war. If you are looking for an adventure novel telling you about one of the exciting projects in detail then I think you would be disappointed.As you can tell I enjoyed the book but there were many unanswered questions that left me wanting more.",

The main events go back to the 50's and 60's and most of Craven's peers and colleagues are long retired or dead. Craven appears to be a substantive scientist, and the book is written certainly from his point of view. Just his reinterpretation of the events around the Glomar Explorer make this an interesting read. Since everything was top secret or higher, we will never really know the truth, and I would doubt that any historian or biographer will ever be able to dig out many of the events in these most secret programs he discusses. However, any older engineer that knew a bit about these things at that time will find the book worthwhile.When I made a quick first pass through the book, I was not so impresssed, but then doing a second, more serious read I liked what I saw. What some would consider self-centered, others would view as the confidence needed in a scientist and administrator to get things done. Due to the secrecy of the programs, there is a lot held back, and I thought this took some carefulness in the writing that would make some topics appear disjointed. I presume Craven had a diary and notes and a good memory to be able to play back some of these events, and again I would be puzzled by how many notes can you keep when everything is top secret.I found this a good read, but I have a historical interest in technology events of that period.

He states that he is prohibited from talking about most of the interesting details because he was a participant, not just an investigative reporter. So the book gives the reader a brief overview of the interesting operational items and goes into depth on more of the management issues. Not really what I was looking for.To be fair to the author he does do a good job in writing the book. Even though there is a limit to the amount of operational \"Hunt for Red October\" type details in the book, he does make it interesting. I kept thinking the real value to the book is as a companion to some of the many other books out there now that detail some of the stories briefly mentioned in this book.

        "description": "November 11, 1918. The final hours pulsate with tension as every man in the trenches hopes to escape the melancholy distinction of being the last to die in World War I. The Allied generals knew the fighting would end precisely at 11:00 A.M, yet in the final hours they flung men against an already beaten Germany. The result? Eleven thousand casualties suffered-more than during the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Why? Allied commanders wanted to punish the enemy to the very last moment and career officers saw a fast-fading chance for glory and promotion. Joseph E. Persico puts the reader in the trenches with the forgotten and the famous-among the latter, Corporal Adolf Hitler, Captain Harry Truman, and Colonels Douglas MacArthur and George Patton. Mainly, he follows ordinary soldiers' lives, illuminating their fate as the end approaches. Persico sets the last day of the war in historic context with a gripping reprise of all that led up to it, from the 1914 assassination of the Austrian archduke, Franz Ferdinand, which ignited the war, to the raw racism black doughboys endured except when ordered to advance and die in the war's last hour. Persico recounts the war's bloody climax in a cinematic style that evokes All Quiet on the Western Front, Grand Illusion, and Paths of Glory. The pointless fighting on the last day of the war is the perfect metaphor for the four years that preceded it, years of senseless slaughter for hollow purposes. This book is sure to become the definitive history of the end of a conflict Winston Churchill called \"the hardest, cruelest, and least-rewarded of all the wars that have been fought.\"",

                "review/text": "I have read a number of histories of World War I. I believe this war was the most important event of the twentieth century, creating world political and social conditions we are still trying to work through today. At this point, 90 years after the start of the war, it is difficult to find an author with a new take on taking us through this history. Mr. Persico has made a valiant attempt and, for the most part, he succeeds.The 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of the year 1918 is, of course, the moment when World War I came to an end. What Mr. Persico does is tell the story of the war with its last day as his starting point. He does this for a couple reasons. First, he wants to make the point that, as the armistice had been signed before this day, the casualties of November 11th were pointless. He then uses the senseless casualties of the last day to bring to life much of the senselessness of the previous four years. He needs to do this to bring the scope of the war into a focus that he can cover in 400 readable pages, using the stories of many individual soldiers to get at the heart of the matter. And we do manage to get a lot of personal stories here: from the great (Foch, Pershing) to the soon to be great (McArthur, Truman, Patton) to the lesser known. And he gives us at least a taste of the German side with, of course, Hitler, Ludendorff and others.The difficulty with the book is that the jumping around in time and place occasionally makes things difficult to follow. And he often gets away from his \"last day\" conceit, spending most of his pages on other days which makes his conceit seem somewhat artificial. Though, to his credit, he does tie everything together rather well by the end with a brief but lucid commentary on the effect of the war.Mr. Persico may not have written the best book on the war but he has given us a fine addition to the literature that can be read in a reasonable amount of time. A quality many tomes on the topic do not share.",

                "review/text": "The author's point concerning the sheer stupidity and callousness of Pershing and other allied commanders in continuing to attack German positions AFTER THE ARMISTICE HAD BEEN SIGNED is earthshaking and almost incomprehensible to today's reader. Yet there it is; probably 6,500 additional American, Canadian, French and British soldiers gave their lives in the six hours between 5:00 AM when the armistice was signed and 11:00 AM when the cease fire took effect. And this was not because of German perfidy or perverseness -- it was due to our own commanders continuing to send troops over the top to attack German trenches.The French and British can be almost forgiven for ordering Americans to die up to the last moment; they looked upon the US troops as Johnny-come-latelys who were going to grab the spoils without paying their butcher's bill. But nothing can excuse Pershing, Bullard, and other American commanders for ordering their troops to attack and die. It is impossible to read Persico's treatise without experiencing mounting anger, but this last date, at whom or what?I will be eternally grateful to author Persico for making this imformation public -- like probably most others I had accepted official reports of casualties (woefully understated for 11/11 in a cover-up) and did not realize the abject criminality of those involved. There were many rationalizations, and Persico offers them all, but to little effect. For this I would give the author 5 stars.Unfortunately, the author flits back and forth from the morning of November 11th, 1918, to other days in the war starting with its beginning. Most of the coverage is through ancedotes from letters and works by participants, but the overall effect detracts from the book's main theme and makes for confusing reading. On this basis the book becomes a personalized narrative, rating only three stars. With respect to learning about the war in a wider context, the book is simply unsuitable.The concluding chapters feature probably the author's best work. His provocative questions and thoughts concerning the armistice of 1918 as leading to World War Two are worth reading. Some of it is light, such as overlooking that the British continued their blockade of Germany until the Versailles Treaty was signed (in a very large sense, continuing the war after the armistice), and the proffered idea that the war needed to be fought through to Germany's total defeat to eliminate any chance of resurgent militarism. It needs to be remembered in this context that no European War had been fought at that time since the Romans to the complete and unconditional surrender of a nation. Prior to WWI, wars were fought to acquire land, resources, hegemony, or to place a particular ruler on a throne, and negotiated treaties had been the norm.Another item treated lightly was that had Wilson not brought the US into the war through propaganda and pretense, the parties most probably would have had to negotiate a peace after fighting to exhaustion on both sides. Clearly this point was reached in 1918, and it was only the American intervention that brought about the German collapse. One is tempted to believe that Hitler would not have come to power and World War Two would not have occurred had the US stayed out of WWI. Unfortunately, Persico does not expound on this thesis.There were a few minor problems such as saying the Germans said, \"Der Krieg ist ueber.\" That's a literal translation for \"The war is over\", but a German would have said, \"Der Krieg ist vorbei\" or something more idiomatic. Overall, however, the prose is excellent and well-edited and the author's writing style is crisp and engaging.In conclusion, author Persico makes many valid points and has produced an important work that adds to the World War One literature. At this late date, that is an achievement in itself. I recommend purchasing this book.",

                "review/text": "\"11th Month, 11th Day, 11th Hour\" by Joseph Persico is an interesting and captivating book covering not only the final moments of the Great War but also offering a general history of the war from its beginning in 1914. The author follows a number of characters, great and small, throughout the narrative. We follow the paths and final fate of a number of soldiers from America, Britain, France, and Germany. We also get glimpses of those who control their destiny, Foch, Haig, Hindenburg and Pershing.The story is well told and you'll find yourself following the lives of these men and women intensely, mostly with the knowledge of what is to come but still drawn into the final agonising moments before the end. The book can jump about a little, from 1914 to 1918, as mentioned by previous reviewers, however I did not find that this detracted from the story and felt it worked well enough.The book has received a few negative reviews in my country (Australia), mainly for the fact that the author tends to miss the other allies (Australia & New Zealand) who were fighting along side the Americans. The Australian Imperial Force (AIF) served from 1915 to 1918 on the Western Front and as a whole suffered a casualty rate of 65%, the highest of any Allied army in WW1. However I can see that this book has been written mainly for an American audience and I think it has done well.The author's intent, to show the terribly tragedy of that final day, the waste of soldiers lives by Generals in an attempt to comply with criminal inept and stupid orders from higher up comes through strongly. Regardless of which nation those soldiers served, it's a well-told story and one that needed to be told.I have read a quite a number of books on the Great War but this is one of the first to bring home the futility of some of the actions carried out by supposedly intelligent leaders & commanders. I hope that we never forget the sacrifice made by all the combatants, willing or not, in this most terrible War.",

Moreover, the other fronts in the war are given almost completely short shrift. Want to know what happened on the war's last day in Italy? The Middle East? Sorry.

John Perisco's \"11 11 11\" provides color, texture and shading to the northwest corner of the drawing, namely the Western Front.It's an interesting concept, finding the theme of senseless slaughter on the last day of the war and using it as the narrative thread to unite the whole war. Think of this book as a bookend to Tuchman's \"The Guns of August\", which deals with statesman, generals and the beginning of the War. This book deals primarily with the men on the front line and the war's end.Tuchman is a better writer, and her narrative is more cohesive. But I still found this book very engrossing and readable, told mostly from the soldier's point of view.Perisco makes some declarative statements I question. For example, he says the great influenza pandemic of 1918 was called the Spanish Influenza \"for no justified reason\" and \"the pandemic may have originated in the American military post at Fort Riley, Kansas.\" History points to San Sebastian on the northern coast of Spain as one of the first places with an identified outbreak of the flu in 1918, so \"for no justified reason\" seems a little harsh. I know of no history that claims that Fort Riley, Kansas was the origin of the flu in the United States, let alone for the entire world.But this is an enjoyable narrative that gives the reader a sense of what the war was like for the men who fought it on the Western Front, with bits of history about Churchill, Pershing, Hitler, Haig and many others that make for a very enjoyable read.It isn't the greatest, most comprehensive or cohesive book about The Great War, but read it as companion to other histories and you won't be disappointed.",

                "review/text": "For years I had been terribly dissatisfied in my search for a truly good overview of World War I. That search has ended with the discovery of this absolute triumph by Joseph Persico.While other authors approach the war as a massive chess game played by scheming generals, with battalions here and regiments there, Perisco focuses on the millions who served and died and were maimed on the front lines. While in the hands of lesser historians these soldiers are mere numbers, Persico personalizes myriad stories. A solider didn't not merely \"serve his country\" and ultimately \"fall in battle.\" He lived in the trenches among the lice, rats and human filth. He ate bad food, wrote letters home to a mother, fought bravely, perhaps killing an enemy solider (one who thus had a grieving lover left behind) with a bayonet thrust to the heart before himself dying a slow agonizing death after being struck by shrapnel in the neck.This is war. Those poor souls who are used as pawns in the giant chess games.No war was ever more wasteful, ever more disastrous than the Great War. Never did so many die so needlessly. The clash of modern warfare against outmoded tactics made the Western Front slaughterhouse.The single most illustrative fact of this war's insanity is the carnage that happened in the time between the agreement of the armistice and the time it took effect. Those hours when the war was not technically over and many officers sent soldiers into the fray one more time. This is the heart and sould of \"Eleventh Hour...\"Persico tells the whole story of the war, from the assassination of Austria's prince that set the wheels in motion, thorough Verdun, the Somme, the U.S. entry and Germany's final failed offensive. But always he flashes forward to the peculiar insanity of the war's last hours.Persico introduces us to numerous soldiers from both sides and their stories of horror, valor and pain through their letters and diaries. We also are reintroduced to more familiar figures who fought in the war such as Adolph Hitler, Harry Truman, Siegfried Sassoon, and Douglas MacArthur.Great works of history illuminate the past and tell stories that stay with the listener or reader. They demonstrate thorough research, a grasp of perspective and the historian's ability to reflect. On those counts. \"Eleventh Month....\" is a masterpiece.It is at once an excellent starting point, culmination and midway reading in any understanding of World War I.",

                "review/text": "\"Eleventh Month, Eleventh Day, Eleventh Hour\" by Joseph Persico is not at all a bad book. If it were an account about an earlier or later war, I might have rated it at four or five stars. However, this book chronicles the Great War, a war that has produced the finest and most captivating masterpieces in fiction (All Quiet on the Western Front, A Farewell to Arms) and nonfiction (The Guns of August, The Price of Glory) alike. When, for example, it is compared to Alistair Horne's account of the battle of Verdun (\"The Price of Glory\") Persico's book falls flat.The title (Eleventh Month, Eleventh Day, Eleventh Hour) seems to imply that the book will focus primarily on the events of the last day of the Great War. While many other WWI accounts will recall the last days with high-profile events such as the Kaiser's abdication or the German representatives' visit to Foch for terms, few mention how the trenches were blazing with gunfire and artillery right up to the final seconds of the Armistice. This is where Persico's book does well, although in my opinion he missed an opportunity to do better. Persico confined the actual account of the final day to a few chapters while scattering the personal accounts to bite-sized excerpts over several preceding chapters--chapters that chronicle the entire war from August 1914.The personal accounts of the last days of the war were good but were unfortunately diluted by Persico's impulse to retell the war in its entirety. My only explanation for why Persico recounted the whole conflict was to make his book more palatable to lay readers. Oddly, many other authors (such as the fore-mentioned Horne) have a little more faith in their audience's ability to recall at least the basic course of the war. If readers need to brush up on their WWI history in order to understand the intended focus of this book, there is no shortage of great World War I overviews (such as those by AJP Taylor or a recent work by John Keegan.)As with any book on the Great War, Persico does well in conveying the immense tragedy of the conflict from both sides on the Western Front. The diary and memior excerpts included in the book are not only from the American, British, and French perspective, but many German accounts are included as well.As I have previously stated, \"Eleventh Month, Eleventh Day, Eleventh Hour\" is not a bad read, but it simply lags in its special classification as a WWI account. For those that have read a multitude of Great War literature (fiction & nonfiction), they will likely be disappointed in the lack of new information presented in this book.",

Hardly confusing, this style is seamlessly executed and lends a dramatic re-telling of events that have shaped world history to this day.

The author admirably gives us what's going on in each phase of the war, and details each battle in a style of Strategy, then Big-Picture, then Zoom in showing the viewpoint of an individual corporal or captain. Plenty of descriptions of what corps or brigades must do and obstacles, but also plenty of quotes from diaries and letters and journals of participants. It doesn't matter that two hundred authors have given the big picture; you must still give your own version of the big picture in order to fit your new private letters quotes and details in it. But I must say this is not a fun read: Here's one detail:\"During the fight the men under MacArthur imagined they had witnessed every permutation of human suffering until they observed the fate of private Jim Gallagher, 168th Infantry. In an anemy night attack illuminated by star shells, a flare lodged in Gallagher's gut. There was nothing his comrades could do to remove the hissing projectile but watch the man die in agony.\"I've read several recent Civil War offerings and see that today's history trend is offering diaries, letters-back-home and journals from corporals, privates and lieutenants; Persico has followed this with much illuminating source content; but he had to give the brigade and corps picture, the generals and strategies too, so we can fit the small into the big and get a clear picture, and Persico fully gives us this. The notes and bib pages, in packed small print, total twenty-seven pages (plenty for volumes way under six or seven hundred pages; this text is 410), including not only books but journals, archives, and gov docs collections, covering the gamut from 1914 to 1999. This is not stale stuff, we get a fresh lot in a full picture of the early glory-seeking and later \"just survive!\" actions and feelings, the soldiers' downtime and the few up times; and it's a balanced picture between the Brits, the French, the AEF (American Expeditionary Force) and the Germans; the privates, and the generals.Here's another in it: \"Troops of the 37th and 79th Divisions were arrayed before Montfaucon, a hill dominating the center of the front. Its earth was steeped in ancient blood. More than a thousand years before, men had died on its slopes in battles between warring tribes. Rain appeared to be the inevitable concomitant of a new offensive on the western front, including this day. Numerous creeks crisscrossing the region flooded and turned fields into quagmires. Troops dumped tens of thousand of sandbags into washed-out roadbeds to allow supply wagons to reach the front. The infantrymen had to lay down duckboards to advance.\"I sure can't quote whole pages here, but every chapter gives good stuff: you hear and touch and smell every forest, every road, every mudpit, every man, besides see it like you are there; and thus gain the understanding. One could easily wish to choose 200 paragraphs to quote trying to give a picture of the illuminating success of this author's efforts: you could in fact read only this book to get a competent view of the daily doings and surviving efforts, and criminal career-motivated orders of many commanders, leading to his main point.He drives home his point of exactly why the men who died that final November morning didn't have to: nothing gained, wasted lives. And woe to infantry advancing against entrenched machine guns.",

        "description": "With \"shattering prose,\" the New York Times-bestselling author of From Here to Eternity captures the intense combat in the battle of Guadalcanal (San Francisco Chronicle). In August of 1942 the first American marines charged Guadalcanal, igniting a six-month battle for two thousand square miles of jungle and sand. In that gruesome stretch sixty thousand Americans made the jump from boat to beach, and one in nine did not return. James Jones fought in that battle, and The Thin Red Line is his haunting portrait of men and war. The soldiers of C-for-Charlie Company are not cast from the heroic mold. The unit's captain is too intelligent and sensitive for the job, his first sergeant is half mad, and the enlisted men begin the campaign gripped by cowardice. Jones's moving portrayal of the Pacific combat experience stands among the great literature of World War II. This ebook features an illustrated biography of James Jones including rare photos from the author's estate.",

But Ihave always thought of Mailer as poseur who wrote what he wrote in order to beaccepted into literary society and become famous. Jones has always seemed tome the real deal. He enlisted in the army in 1939, was at Pearl Harbor whenthe Japs attacked, fought in the Solomons, receiving the Bronze Star with V forValor and the Purple Heart.With the money he made from &quot;From Here to Eternity,&quot; Jones founded a writer'scolony and paid the hospital bills of the great and tragic poet DelmoreSchwartz, who clearly influenced Jones' writing. See especially the poem &quot;Forthe One Who Would Take Man's Life in His Hands&quot; from the collection &quot;SummerKnowledge&quot; published in 1938.As far as I know, no critic has ever noticed this, but the first stanza of thispoem in 12 lines gives the storyline of &quot;From Here to Eternity.&quot; The secondstanza gives that of &quot;The Thin Red Line,&quot; and the third and final stanza that of&quot;Whistle.&quot;Jones carried out something remarkable, getting the vision for a monumentalliterary undertaking from a poem he read as an enlisted man in a garrison army,actually carrying out the vision and producing what, in my opinion, is thedefinitive American fictional narrative of the war. In short, Jones turned hislife into a poem and that poem into splendid novels.I stand in awe.",

                "review/text": "In a word - incredible. Terrence Malick's sketchy, loooong, underdeveloped movie does not do this classic justice. If you care about the WW II soldier, what this generation did for ours, and what it was like to fight on an infernal island thousands of miles from home, witnessing savagery and experiencing traumas that you could never fully recover from, you simply must read this one.James Jones masterfully goes from one character to another, introducing the reader to the character's internal thoughts, while keeping the novel moving, marching through the jungle, to a conclusion that is exactly how it was for the soldier - this battle over, on to the next, what for, who cares - you didn't die, but you probably will on the next island.How does one manage these thoughts, as a sane, rational human being? Jones' does an amazing job of bringing out these subleties in each character, how each one deals with it, how each one thinks about it. You can almost feel yourself there on the island, having made it through a day of horrors, lost some acquaintances, exhausted, and what for? In WW 2, it wasn't one year and out of service - you were in it 'til A.) you died, B.) you were maimed, or C.) the war ended. After 24 hours of constant combat and no water during a battle, all you had to look forward to during your &quot;recovery&quot; (a day, two days, a week?) was the same thing all over again, until you either died or somehow, the war ended.While Mallick's films fails spectacularly in attempting to illustrate these points, Jones succeeds in ways that will only cause you to keep reading, imagining what it must have been like, yet thanking your God that you weren't there, and that these brave men were there for us.I cannot imagine why the earlier reviewer here at Amazon trashed this book. Please make your judgements based on the 30-some glowing reviews and his/her one negative review. My only criticism with this book is that Jones seems to be fixated on the p*nis (can you write p*nis at Amazon?!), and writes about homosexuality among the troops quite frequently. Well, he was there, so he must know, and while I personally don't enjoy reading about a man longing for another's &quot;sweet, girl-like buttocks,&quot; I have to defer to the author and trust his experience on this one.Do yourself a favor, buy this book, and like &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front,&quot; add a timeless war classic to your collection that will help add to your &quot;humanistic&quot; understanding of the war, a war which was about tactics and generals and presidents and prime ministers, but more than anything, like all wars, came down to the individual courage and suffering of the individual soldier.Sermon over.",

                "review/text": "It's difficult to write a book about soldiers at war. There are always many characters, the ranks are confusing, the description of the battles must be very accurate otherwise the reader will be lost. If it's fiction, the author must be very careful not to, unwillingly, transform his book in a re-telling of other, more commonly known battle events. James Webb managed to write a very good book about soldiers at war, \"Fields of fire\". Cornelius Ryan wrote a series of excellent non-fiction books about the second World War in its European Theatre.\"The thin red line\" is about the battle of Guadalcanal, an island of the Solomons chain and an important base in the south Pacific Ocean, between the american and the japanese troops.\"The thin red line\", by author and ex-combatent James Jones, was brought under the spotlights once again more recently after cult director Terrence Mallik transposed it to the big screen, for the second time, in 1998 (the first time was in 1964). The movie is visually beautiful, long, and insightful, with extraordinary development of its main characters. The book does not have visual resources, but Jones' fast prose, moving from character to character, from battle scenes to the long nights spent in the open, all this makes the reader \"watch\" what is happening with his or her mind, just like it was a movie.Jones knows what he is writing about. He was there, he did that. And he is intelligent. War battles are not much different, one from another (except if you are actually there, of course). So, Jones technic is to write unusually long chapters, to make the reader feel involved with the environment, with the people of C-for-Charlie Company. All the characters, with no exception, have, contrary to the chapters, unusually short names - four or five letters at most. Witt, Fife, Bell, Dale, Stein, Tall, Bosch, Bead, Gaff, just one syllabe, they are easy to remember and their sonority makes the reader instantly recognize the person associated to the name. Also, the brevity of the names reminds us of the brevity of the lives of his characters, fighting unexpected death at every moment.\"The thin red line\" is fiction, but barely. The last sentence of the book gives Jones away. It's fiction in the sense of characters ann their development, and building atmosphere. It is very good fiction, really a masterpiece. And it's a true account on the horrors of war. Fiction and truth, ballanced. Enjoy both parts.Grade 9.0/10",

                "review/text": "So here is my review for The Thin Red Line. This book is basically about an extended series of battles on Guadalcanal. Most of the men have never seen combat before this and are rightly terrified. The author goes from man to man exploring each ones fears and thoughts. This could've been a good thing except for the fact that there are like twenty guys that he does this with. It just gets overbearing at times, at a lot of times. Also, none of the characters was particularly likable. At best, I found myself just tolerating them and at worst, hating them. They are either arrogant, cowards, selfish, whiny, or any number of unappealing character traits that completely define them. Something else I did not understand was the overt homesexual theme that ran throughout the novel. I didn't know that so many U.S. soldiers engaged in guy on guy action just because there were no women around. It seemed awkward to me and, though I wasn't there, I found myself doubting whether it really happened to the extent that it did in the story. This book pulls itself along like a snail and except for the battles, nothing else remotely interesting happens. Like I said, you see what each man is thinking, and then you see that man get gunned down. And you don't even care. The author does do a good job of describing the battle scenes themselves, but I found myself not really understanding what they were doing as far as strategy goes. I just concentrated on the combat and not the tactics themselves. I forced myself to finish this book because I was on a war-novel binge and this was supposed to be a good one. Now I wonder why I even bothered at all. Approach with caution.",

Both address the difficulties of facing and accepting death brought on by war. The book does this in a realistic, almost 'in your face' way with its detailed depictions of soldiers' experiences, both on the front line and off, and as it delves into each character's evolving thoughts and emotions. James Jones really brings you onto the battle field and into the soldiers' minds. The movie on the other hand takes a poetic, almost ethereal approach, leaving you to wonder and reflect upon death and war. While it doesn't take you deep into all of the character's minds, the movie does offer powerful imagery and eloquent narratives to illustrate its message...as well as excellent performances by the actors themselves. I highly recommend reading this book and seeing the movie, but don't expect them to take you down the same road. And if you're expecting another &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, then you should see &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; is on a whole other level.",

Because of this book, I now understand what my great-uncle must have gone through on Saipan and Okinawa where he was killed in action.

He describes many events that comprise a battle, the transport, the encampment, the waiting, the shelling, the shooting, the fighting, the bravery, the cowardice. We enter the minds of those who fight. Some fight for politcal advancement. Some fight for fear of being labled a coward. Some fight just becuase they love the company and men they're fighting with. The main characters are John Bell, a former engineering officer who resigns his commission to be with his wife. He opens the story as a lowly private. The fear of being killed hardly enters his mind. He's too worried that his wife is cheating on him to think about anything else. Corporal Fife, the company clerk and coward, learns to fight and love it. 1st Sergeant Welsh is the madman leader of the non-coms who does surprisingly little fighting. He likes to walk around and stir the pot. This is probably due to his two canteens full of gin. There are many other important characters, but interesting to me is a minor one named Witt. Witt, is the doppleganger of Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt from Jones first book of the trilogy From Here to Eternity. Witt, like Prewitt is a strong willed Kentuky boy who was once a regimental boxer. In this book he drifts in and out of the company as it suits him. The 1998 movie focuses on him much more than the novel.If you are interested in World War II, you'll enjoy this book.",

Each novel tell the stories of a group of inexperienced soldiers sent as cannonfodder to fight the Japanese on a lonely Pacific island.But under the surface, the novels could not be more different. Norman Mailer's novel uses the war as a vehicle to preach a message about hypocricy and corruption at the core of American culture. The soldiers, not really human to start with, are manipulated and degraded by the military machine.The soldiers in The Thin Red Line face the same experiences as Mailer's characters. But Jones' characters are realistically human. They display independent thought (rational or not) and realistic emotions (alternately strained and dampened by the extremity and exhaustion of battle). Canny or confused, each one strives to make sense of the war and of his own responses. The theme of the book is the diversity of those responses. The last line sums it up: \"One day one of their number would write a book about all this, but none of them would believe it, because none of them would remember it that way.\"Mailer gives us subhuman characters cast as soldiers; Jones helps us appreciate the humanity that survives even in the most degrading circumstances.Although this is a novel about characters, it does not let the reader get sentimentally attached to them. I appreciated the measure of emotional distance because otherwise the (sometimes graphic) death, destruction, and mayhem would have been painful to read.",

Those looking for an anti-war or pro-war message will be disappointed.This book can be read on two levels. One can read it for its hard-hitting descriptions of combat. The fighting scenes on the various hills of Guadalcanal are somewhat tedious to read through the first time, but become clearer with a further reading. The raw impressions of the members of Charlie Company (with curses and all) are also particularly effective.On another level, Jones seeks to describe the human (as opposed to the mechanized) element of war. He describes the raw feelings of the men of Charlie Company. Some can't wait to kill the enemy. Others want to get out at any cost. Most are just resigned to their fate. Shining examples of heroism are also to be found. Jones also discusses the nature of leadership, as well as the opportunism and politics that thrives in any military organization. Jones makes sure that we never forget that an army is first and foremost an organization of people, and that it is these human relationships that shape the war.&quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; is one of the masterpieces of American war literature. If you like &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, I also recommend Jones's earlier novel, &quot;From Here to Eternity.&quot;",

Nearly all of the reports include the order of battle and commanders for both sides, with the outcome where known reported in terms of causualities (killed, wounded, captured and missing) as well as overall victor and significance of the fight.The value of O'Kelley's book are the narrative reports of skirmishes and small encounters as well as the major battles of Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse. The narratives are concise, but usually with enough detail to get more than a flavor of the actions and personality of the leaders, particularly in the bloody clashes between Whig and Tory partisan bands, many of which gave no quarter as some clashes were more for revenge than for political or military gain. \"Nothing but Blood and Slaughter\" demonstrates that nowhere in the colonies was the fighting so extensive, so personal, so destructive as in the Carolinas.All of the \"Nothing but Blood and Slaughter\" volumes are essential for any student of the American Revolutionary war and/or for students unconventional warfare.O'Kelley is a retired Special Forces Master combat veteran and an avid participant in Revolutionary War recreations, and with those experiences provides an insight most historians miss. His research is extensive, with much of the incidents he reports about being ignored in the history books. He does an excellent job of separating myth from fact. For example, many believe the Revolutionary War ended with the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown. Not so. O'Kelley is now working on a fourth volume, reporting on incidents of warefare in 1782 and beyond.The only negatives are more of a nuisance rather than flaws in reporting. Volume III is riddled with typos and, as in Volumes I and II, he uses endnotes rather than footnotes, requiring the reader to constantly be thumbing back and fourth. However the end notes are extensive,often more enlightening, adding to the authenticity of O'Kelley's exceptional work.",
