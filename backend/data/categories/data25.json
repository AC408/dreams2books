        "description": "A novel that seamlessly blends military intrigue, relentless suspense, and a baffling mystery, The Advocate is a harrowing account by two master storytellers who dare to imagine what can really happen in the fire of war, where good and evil aren't always what they seem. Here one man must pierce the military's impenetrable wall of silence to prove that even in the midst of a world war, murder is still a crime. The Advocate On a chalky bluff overlooking the windswept English Channel, an old man watches a horrifying spectacle unfold. Within a matter of seconds, one American P-47 Thunderbolt fires on another, mercilessly driving the crippled plane into the sea. And the old man, his cottage strafed, barely escapes with his life. The year is 1943: The Russians have defeated Hitler at Stalingrad. North Africa has fallen to the Allies. And the Americans, after two disastrous years, are winning the war in the Pacific. Now, in England, American fliers wage a bitter air war against the Luftwaffe. But what really happened in the skies above the Channel is something no one--least of all the military--is prepared to have revealed. To find out the truth, the Judge Advocate's office calls on a brilliant, cynical, homesick lawyer. The last thing Harry Voss wanted was a case that had every indication of becoming a political powder keg. But Harry, a man of honor, cannot turn his back on the possibility that the incident over the Channel may not have been an accident--but an act of cold-blooded murder. Harry has no idea what he is getting into. For his investigation will lead through a labyrinth of military politics, where ambitious, powerful men guard their turf and soldiers guard their secrets with an unbreakable code of silence. For Harry, the case becomes his own personal war, as he uncovers a series of murderous events that detonate up the chain of command. He only wants justice for a crime. And he is willing to risk his own career and life to get it, as he begins a dangerous journey into the dark heart of war. It is here that Harry Voss will dare to enter a world where heroes are killers, wrong becomes right, and even angels must dip their wings into the fire of hell itself From the Hardcover edition.",

                "review/text": "On August 15, 1943 five American soldiers stationed in Chillingham, England flew over Germany on a mission. On their return home, one of the fighters shot down a single engine plane in an apparent friendly fire incident. A shepherd and his wife watched the event until the pilot notices them and tries to kill them too.Colonel Joseph Ryan assigns his friend Lieutenant Harry Voss to investigate the accident. Harry goes to the scene of the incident where he learns from the shepherd and his wife what they saw. Harry also notices that the film on the nose of the plane is missing and believes one of the two survivors destroyed it. Soon one of the men confesses to killing his peers, but Harry observes discrepancies in the story, as if he is hiding something. A superior officer tells Harry to back off, but the tenacious officer continues to make inquiries even if it costs him his career.World War II fans will get a feel for the way it was for a Yankee stationed in England during the Big One. Readers learn that there is quite a difference between allies and friends. THE ADVOCATE provides a look inside the armed forces community especially policing and passing judgment on one of their own. The story moves slowly forward because the authors want their audience to use all five senses to savor the history. The characters are fascinating, noting Harry and his antagonist as the real stars. Bill A. Mesce Jr. and Steven G. Szilagyi have quite a future ahead of them if this historical war tale is any indication of their talent.Harriet Klausner",

While using a narrator may be a clever idea in some instances, here it detracts. We had no idea who this narrator was until about a third of the way in. The use of British idioms was annoying but finally made some sense when we find out the nationality of the narrator. This is essentially a story about a non-story, that is, there is nothing to it. It is really unfortunate for Mesce has written another one about Major Harry Voss, an interesting character, but Mesce fails to do anything with him.

It is a sleeper of a book and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys WWII fiction. The characters are believable, the authors get the tone and feel of the times right. You pick up little nuances like calling a Rolls Royce a Rollers. I chuckled at the prospect of Harry Voss fighting the intractable gear shift of a jeep and the MP sargent finally offering to park it for him. This stuff rings true. The story itself is well crafted and has enough surprises to keep you interested. It is not a hell bent action story and may leave some readers who are used to that type of story unsatisfied. The military details are right, I kept seeing scenes of 12 O'Clock High running through my mind. It was enjoyable to see a rumpled, overweight main character in contrast to so many super heroes that are now the norm.

This is probably more true-to-life than most of us (who opt for more action and contrived situations) like in this genre. Not a bad read but it is ambivalent and, with two authors, one understands why. If you like books about the military and WWII,, you'll like this book.

Billy Boyle himself wonders. Back home in Southie, he'd barely made detective when war was declared. Unwilling to fight-and perhaps die-for England, he was relieved when his mother wangled a job for him on the staff of a general married to her distant cousin. But the general turns out to be Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose headquarters are in London, which is undergoing the Blitz. And Uncle Ike wants Billy to be his personal investigator. Billy is dispatched to the seat of the Norwegian government in exile. Operation Jupiter, the impending invasion of Norway, is being planned, but it is feared that there is a German spy amongst the Norwegians. Billy doubts his own abilities, with good reason. A theft and two murders test his investigative powers, but Billy proves to be a better detective than he or anyone else expected. From the Trade Paperback edition.",

Billy Boyle finds himself not in a sheltered stateside billet but in a freezing B-17 on his way to war-torn London, assigned to Hq, European Theater of Operations. How did he get here? As he's arrived at so many other destinations in his young life: through family connections, this one on his mother's side--the Douds. When he arrives, his \"Uncle Ike,\" General Dwight D. Eisenhower, briefs him on his first assignment, to use his skills as a detective in finding a spy who has infiltrated \"Operation Juno,\" an Allied operation centered on Norway.There are things that Billy doesn't know about \"Operation Juno,\" and things that Ike doesn't know about Billy, particularly that Billy passed the detective's exam only with some family help. And Billy himself doesn't know how he's going to pull this off, but he knows his duty when he sees it. And he's been a Boston cop for five years, and has learned a lot about detection from his father, himself a veteran South Boston cop.So Billy begins his investigation, and then there's a murder, and then another death, a heartbreaking one. Billy moves about, from London to the English countryside, and to other military bases, learning all the time--from his associates, from the people he meets along the way, and from his own memories of his father's life and what his father has taught him. Things like \"chasing a lie\" to find the truth, and looking for remorse when it should be found, but isn't always.The writing here is absolutely excellent, skillfully interweaving Billy's search for a murderer and for justice with the lessons that he's been learning all his life, now concentrated in a war-time environment. The characters are beautifully realized, and all have something to teach Billy. Eisenhower appears only a few times, but each time he introduces a theme of the novel: family, the inevitability of loss, and the terrible costs of war. And the author shines in his characterization of Billy, who at the start of his tale is simultaneously cocky yet unsure of himself in this brand new milieu; as his investigation continues, he learns the lessons of war, and of family, of true bravery, and of manhood.The various settings are perfectly detailed, whether in bombed-out London, at an English country house, or in a newly-built mess hall in England, so new that the sawdust from its construction still lies in straight lines on the ground nearby. Likewise, dialogue is true to the period, yet never trite.This is a fine book, with an engaging hero. It is suspenseful, often charming, and always thoughtful, right up to its exciting denouement. I'm looking forward to the next one in the series.",

The novel's characters relect that trend yet they have the human flaws that are incumbent in all people, but so well described in this work by Mr. Benn. This is a book that is a mystery and really is. The obvious is not so obvious and the surprises come out of left field. I read this in two nights. It would have only taken me one night but I needed to sleep since I had to work the next morning, but you know, I could have skipped work and it would have been worth it.",

This book is an excellant kickoff for me.Although I read BLOOD ALONE first, I highly recommend reading these in order. The character definitely matures from book to book. The status and relationships with other characters also develop. Also the mood changes, this having the most humor of the three books. Anyway, this book sets up the main character, a distant relative of General Dwight Eisenhower and an Irish-American cop in Boston who's just made detective when the U.S. enters the war. He expects his relationship to Ike to pave his way into a nice cushy and safe staff job in the army, but of course it doesn't turn out that way for him. Instead, he becomes Ike's personal investigator and is assigned to ferret out a spy connected with the Norwegian Government in exile in England. This is an intricate mystery with the war background. The only warning I'll give is that it will hook you and you'll want to read the two sequels as well.",

What was advertised as a war time mystery set in London with General Eisenhower playing role devolved into basically a locked room murder mystery set in an English manor house and not a particularly compelling one at that. The lead character, Billy Boyle, has a lot of potential with his background as a Boston cop and rather brash nature but the presentation of his character is not consistent. Sometimes Billy is insecure and nave while on other occasions he is insightful and observant. I suppose one could argue that he grows by leaps and bounds in the course of this story but if that is the author's intent it unravels in the end where Billy is left looking less then stellar. A large dose of period elements could have livened up the show ala the works of Kaminsky, Goulart and Collins but what we see here seems forced as if the author tossed in a scene in a pub or with a very English \"character\" every fifty or so pages to add period color rather then integrate the story firmly into it's time and place. The war finally comes to call in the last fifty pages or so and shows us a little of what the author is capable of, hopefully we'll see this obvious potential realized in future offerings in this series but I think I'll wait for the paperback myself....",

After the entrance of the United States in to World War II Boyle, a Boston police officer, doesn't allow his influential family to keep him from serving his country in the Army, but he doesn't want too dangerous of a job so he goes to Officer Candidate School hoping to serve his time in the Army at a billet safely out of harm's way. Life for Boyle takes an unexpected turn early in the novel when he's sent to serve at Headquarters, European Theater of Operations, which is commanded by his uncle, General Dwight Eisenhower. When he arrives, Ike gives Boyle the job of tracking down a German spy that's infiltrated Allied HQ before this spy has an opportunity to impact a planned allied invasion of Norway, or so he thinks.With very limited experience as an investigator in Boston and no experience in counter-intelligence operations, Boyle's task is already daunting but he encounters murder and maddening reluctance and sometimes outright hindrance from American and British military figures as he attempts to complete his mission.This novel is written entirely from a first person perspective. It's as if Boyle is telling his own story as it happens. That was a little off putting in the beginning but I eventually got used to it. Unfortunately, except for Boyle, Benn doesn't fully flesh out many of his characters. I never felt like the story was all that real or suspenseful. I was a little surprised at the ending but never felt a \"Wow!\" moment because Benn doesn't do all that great of a job building suspense, just confusion. By the end of the book I was more confused than Benn's main character Boyle. Perhaps he intended it that way.Lastly, for Kindle owners this book is well formatted in most places but does have one annoying issue. The first half line or full line of each chapter is written in capital letters and often the words are not properly spaced. It would have been nice for the publisher to take the time to fix this minor annoyance in the Kindle edition.",

The New York Times bestselling spy novel The Company lays bare the history and inner workings of the CIA. This critically acclaimed blockbuster from internationally renowned novelist Robert Littell seamlessly weaves together history and fiction to create a multigenerational, wickedly nostalgic saga of the CIA-known as \"the Company\" to insiders. Racing across a landscape spanning the legendary Berlin Base of the '50s, the Soviet invasion of Hungary, the Bay of Pigs, Afghanistan, and the Gorbachev putsch, The Company tells the thrilling story of agents imprisoned in double lives, fighting an amoral, elusive, formidable enemy-and each other-in an internecine battle within the Company itself. \"Compulsive reading from start to finish.\" -The Boston Globe \"Hugely entertaining . . . A serious look at how our nation exercises power. . . .

Second, it serves as a living history review of clandestine U.S. ventures going back to World War II. And third, no matter what political perspective you come from, you will come away a different take on the War on Terrorism.Robert Littell takes several young men who joined the brand-new CIA after the war and follows their careers. All enter the spy game because their experiences with communism during the war have lead them to believe that it is a destructive element that must be halted. From the same war comes a young communist who as whole-heartedly believes that communism is the salvation of the world. They will fight on different battlegrounds throughout \"The Company\"--Berlin, Hungary, Cuba, Afghanistan--until communism collapses.In many ways, \"The Company\" is a standard spy thriller, with ample supply of the requisite secrets, double-crossing, and triple agents. There's an unnecessary Alice in Wonderland theme throughout and some clunky writing. But what makes the book stand out is not just the skill Littell brings to the plot,but the scope. This is a history of covert activities, and because we see so many major incursions represented, we can watch disturbing patterns develop. It seems that since WWII, the U.S. has entered a number of frays for all the right reasons and withdrawn before the matter could be resolved. \"The Company\" deals with the spies and civilians left dangling, and raises questions about earlier policies that may have left us vulnerable to terrorists.This is a timely book that I hope will excite discussion and increase understanding. If readers don't agree with Littell's take on events, then I hope they'll do research on their own. \"The Company\" should encourage readers to take a look at the past, and is a whopping good read to boot.",

Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.The book's overall plot, a &quot;history&quot; of CIA's sucesses and failures in the Cold War, is well done except that Mr. Littell conveniently avoids a few of our &quot;successes&quot;, such as the U-2, SR-71, and intel satellite programs, the war in Laos (the only part of the overall Viet Nam War that the US didn't lose), etc.My main quibble with this book is the appalling lack of research done by the author on the Washington DC area, and history in general. Examples: There was no Beltway around DC in 1956, there was no &quot;downtown&quot; Springfield, Va or Hilton hotel in 1951, or Tysons Corner suburb in the time used by Littell. And, by the way, Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, not DC. I could go on, but I'll just mention one more glaring error; telephone area codes in the 1950s? Jeez Loueez! There are so many mistakes about Agency components that I would not, even if I could, begin to list them here. Bottom line: not that well done, in my (biased) opinion.",

                "review/text": "Robert Littell has written some of the best books in this genre but for some reason he does not seem to have the audience of a LeCarre, a Ludlum, and others. If you enjoy any of the well known and widely read of this type you will certainly enjoy this man's work. \"The Company\", is a massive work of almost 900 pages, it still reads well and is in no way ponderous or excessive. As many books seem to continually shorten it is a pleasing exception that Mr. Littell took all the time and pages he needed to tell his story.To any readers of Cold War novels all of the topics that are covered in this book will be familiar but not unwelcome. This book covers a very large portion of the CIA'S existence and presents familiar events as part of a continuum as opposed to focusing on a single event like The Bay Of Pigs, Kennedy, Suez, etc in isolation. There are very good books on all of these topics both documentary and in the form of novels. This work places them all in a larger continual historical context as well as a more realistic one. These historical events did not take place in solitary or in a vacuum, they were events that were planned and dealt with together with all of the other issues that were at hand for the agency at the time. They were also planned and executed by people who developed and created the atmosphere of the agency with their talents as well as their faults. By presenting the large picture as opposed to an isolated historical event, Mr. Littell gives readers the wide perspective that only an inclusive history can offer.This is a novel and while not appropriate it is tempting to forget that what you are reading contains much truth albeit as presented in the form of literary fiction. Mr. Littell clearly has his favorites and those he thinks little of in terms of the players who conducted the operations at the agency. He gets close to the edge of editorial extreme with some of his depictions but I don't know that he really crossed any lines that readers will find difficult to accept.If you have never read this man's work, this is not only a great place to begin, but also a grand tale told with the appropriate pace.",

                "review/text": "I read a lot of non-fiction spy books (bios, histories, etc.)as well as espionage novels. But I don't read spy fiction in order to learn history but to gain an original and creative insight into the minds and personalities of those who engage in spying. Le Carre, Graham Greene, Charles McCarry, Eric Ambler, Len Deighton or David Ignatius have delivered that (to me, at least). Littell in this very (very) long \"A Novel of the CIA\" has failed (I haven't read his other novels). This is just a very silly and quite boring stuff, full of many, many factual mistakes (Washington didn't have a subway system in 1974: Mosadegh was not an Arab nationalist) and it's quite embarassing to follow the stories of Littell's set of streotypical characters (a Mossad agent in Berlin who dresses like a Rabi, for example). The only interesting material (about Philby, Angleton, Dallas) is drawn straight from books that any reader of espionage will recognize (Brown and Knightley on Philby, which includes his address in Washington); Grose on Dallas; Mangold and Winks on Angleton). So, there is not a lot of original research here. Now, there is nothing wrong about mixing fact and fiction. Norman Mailer did a good job in \"Harlot's Ghost,\" another \"A Novel of the CIA\" of developing Angleton's character (as well as others), and Banville has written a literary masterpiece in \"The Untouchable\" (about Blunt). It just doesn't work here, and as far as the various conspiracy theories in the book... well, I perefer the real nutty fantasies that Delillo (Libra) or Ellroy (American Tabloid) provide us. Littell recycles here a mishmash of explanations for historical events that are the level of a under-developed Oliver Stone. In short, don't waste your time. Life is short. If you want to know about the Cold War, read the real stuff.",

What could they write about.Le Carr&eacute; has moved on, but Robert Littell remains, and with The Company he has firmly established himself master of the genre. This is an awesome book, a spy thriller of the old school, with moles and Joes, cutouts and dead-drops, plots and counterplots. There are the usual colourful characters - the Sorcerer in the seedy sleazy alleys of post-war Berlin is worth the price of the book alone - and thrilling if not romantic situations. It goes on for a satisfying length, a good solid read, and there are meaty plots and subplots and subsubplots to give the reader a generous fill as the story follows through the early days of the CIA and the freezing of the Cold War, past Hungary and Cuba, a long episode in Afghanistan and ultimately to the White House of Boris Yeltsin, where generations meet in a blazing conclusion.There are plot twists and red herrings, tension and drama as the key players work against each other to uncover a high-level mole. I won't give the game away, but if you keep your wits about you right from the beginning, you should be able to spot the first seeds that will sprout shoots of doubt and ultimately grow to bear fruit many many years later.The plotting (and I use the word advisedly) in this book is of a high level. It flows naturally, never forced, always thrusting the story along. Little details echo the moods and motivations of the characters, tieing in to one another and weaving a multi-stranded tapestry that gives the book so much of its satisfying flavour. It is hard to say what I enjoyed most, but perhaps the scenes that most impressed me were inside the Ronald Reagan White House, where the various political motivations of Washington institutions were dealt with in rambling code phrases in a sort of real-like movie shot in the mind of the President. Scary, haunting stuff.But I guess I'm rambling too. Make no mistake. This novel is big, but it is no meandering time-filler. It is tightly written for all its size, and it will keep you turning just one more page until you get to the end. It is one of those rare books where you get to the end and want to start at the beginning again to read it again in a new light.Highly recommended.",

To even mention John Le Carre in the same breath in terms of writing skills is sacrilegious. Any 50 consecutive pages of Smiley's People are far superior to the whole 900 pages of this book.There are very interesting passages...even chapters. But if I ever see the words &quot;steaming coffee&quot;, a drink in &quot;his paw&quot; or enumerable other words sets that repeat again, again, and again...well, I'll be pulled back into the bad overall reaction to this book. The characters are black and white, the good guys win and the bad guys get killed. Men are strong, women are weak. Ronald Reagan is portrayed as a political cartoon. Much of the dialogue - especially toward the end - is stilted and false. The basic plot has a major hole in it when one realizes that the undercover spy who is the go between the major traitors in the book was actually a close college classmate of two of the CIA hero's...come on. All that trouble to invent a new identity for a guy who lives in Washington where a chance meeting with his old friends at Yale could blow the whole thing open? Further, the Sorcerer drank so much alcohol for so long that his liver would have shut down well before his reputation. Neither would have lasted for 900 pages. When I read the great editorial reviews my mind wonders whether the phantom wall between some of Wall Street's &quot;independent stock brokers&quot; and the investment banking end have wandered uptown into the publishing business.

The problem is that I don't want a sequel. Weaver hasn't given us a single character to care about. The central character is not nice, committed to anything that makes sense, or bright. He seems very, very young. And his logic stinks: he joins a school to get away from home, and then desperately seeks to go home again, to a home that is not poor, but middle class/professional, a loving father, and an apparently adequate environment. Subsidiary characters mostly exist to die messily. Why? And then the novel ends with pages of appendixes that are a clear indication that the author took himself far too seriously. Weaver, however, is best when self-deprecating, humorous, ironic, or lighthearted (though he's crude and abusive on the subject of parenthood). He loses track of that in this novel that lacks shape.",

Relations between the Seven Systems Alliance and Terra has been steadily deteriorating and the Guard Corps foresees the need for many more officers with the anticipated onset of war. Exeter was chosen as the site of the Academy due to the extensive ruins left by the alien Racinians.Scott St. Andrew is a colonist from Gatewood-Callista who has entered the Academy to escape the mines. He and his brother Jarret have been assigned to the same squad under Squad Sergeant Judiah Pope, a second year cadet. Scott is despised by his squad mates as a genny, the bearer of a birth mark that indicates that he has the mutated genes resulting from a virus infection several generations earlier.In this novel, someone cuts the line that Scott is using to rappel down a cliff. Although saved by Pope with a anti-gravity gun, another of his squadmates, Roolsin Halitov, tries to have him kicked out for the incident, but is thwarted by the evidence of the cut rope. Halitov, also from Gatewood-Callista, is determined to get rid of Scott because of his low scores and unimpressive performance.After they return to the barracks, Halitov attacks Scott but is driven off by two other squadmates, Dina Anne Forrest and Paul Beauregard. Since the attack was observed by the barracks surveillance devices, Pope punishes Halitov by placing Scott in his charge, so that both will graduate from the Academy or wash out together. Later Jarret is beaten by other cadets because he defends his brother.This novel tells the story of Scott as he learns to be a soldier and a leader of soldiers. When war breaks out between the Seven Systems and the Terran Alliances, he is placed in command of a unit and gains actual experience in combat. He is by no means an ideal officer, but learns from his mistakes.This novel is loosely based on the circumstances among US Army officers prior to the Civil War. The West Point graduates from the South were faced with conflicting loyalties and many later found themselves facing their former classmates in battle. However, Scott faces a further conflict between opposing forces within the Seven Systems Alliance itself.This story also explores the advantages and drawbacks of a conditioning process developed by the Racinians which provides a degree of control of the laws of nature, even to the extent of countering gravity. While he has some superhuman capabilities, there are unforeseen consequences.Recommended for anyone who enjoys Combat SF tales.-Arthur W. Jordin",

Not only is this a serious breach of ethics, but does this earlier reviewer really think there's no one that actually likes the book? If he does, then he's wrong.I did like the book; it was engaging. The characters were full of shifting traits, and those traits were believable. The Quantum Physics stuff was an an interesting sub-plot to the story of Scott. Being an amateur physicist, I completely enjoyed this take on the byplay between atoms and conciousness. The universe set up was a bit trite, with the colonies fighting a tyrannical Earth. But how many really wonderful works of SF had the same set up?I'm also an aspiring SF author and so not only did I read the words on the page, but I analyzed them too. There were sentences that I sometimes thought could be reworked, but over all I liked Mr. Weaver's word choices. More than once I came across a word that I either knew was uncommon or had to actually look up myself. While many people might find that jarring, I considered inspired. Overused words fade into the background. Mr. Weaver knew how to use words to hammer home points.Of course, I did have problems with the book too, but really they didn't come until the end.

                "review/text": "Brothers in Arms falls into the category of Military Sci-Fi. In the tradition of these novels it is short, punchy, heavy on technology and light on plot or characterisation. It draws heavily on books such as Haldeman's \"Forever War\" and Steakleys \"Armour\". For me I think it lacks the punch that Forever War displays, but is better written than either of the above books. The standard genre elements such as the basic military setting, the hard cadet training and the soldier being thrown into war at the deep end are all fleshed out by other elements. There is the Alliance/Colony power struggle which erupts into Civil War, so that the cadets are pitted against each other rather than some faceless enemy. There is a racist undertone of being a colonist, and the worse stigma of being a genetic freak. There is the poorly understood technology of a disappeared race, and what exactly it does to you. Because Weaver has actually done his research and constructed a plausible galaxy for us, there are enticing visions of worlds and ideas that lie outside the story. Weaver is obviously keeping back a larger picture and letting us see only a glimpse of this world. This may be a prelude to a series of books, or it may merely be good technical writing skill. I have not given Brothers in Arms a great rating because I think the book fails in a number of its key objectives. Weaver wanted to show us the transmogrification of his central character from uncertain idealistic boy to a pragmatic and confident officer. In this he fails. The character at the end seems to me no different from the one at the beginning. I felt the characterisation of Halitov (the sidekick) was better managed and the layers beneath him were explored better. Also, there are issues in the book that needed better development, such as the political ramifications of the split between colonies and alliance etc. I suppose it is a feature of Mil/Sci/Fi that you get only the grunts view of the world. I like to see things on a broader canvas and for that reason I find the genre unsatisfying. I think Weaver had the makings of a great speculative fiction novel here but that he harnessed it to the wrong genre, a bit like hitching a racehorse to a cart. If you have got to the bottom of this review you will probably feel much the same as me about the book. Those who lost interest in my review in the first paragraph will probably get a kick out of it.

Now Bond debutes an exciting new series that rockets straight from the cutting edge of America's war on terror . . . Officially designated the Joint Services Special Demands Project, \"The Team\" is a unique unit created to address unconventional threats in an unconventional manner, beyond the beurocratic restraints of either the U.S. intelligence or military establishments. With an almost unlimited budget, the Team, consisting of a CIA officer, two Special Forces commandos, and one outnumbered Marine--is authorized to track vital intel and then take immediate action. A radical response to perilous times, the Team has never been more needed than this very moment: a quantity of radioactive waste, being shipped across the former Soviet Union, has gone missing. In the wrong hands, the stolen material can be converted into a \"dirty bomb\" capable of rendering any American city uninhabitable for centuries. With time running out, the Team must locate and neutralize the threat--unaware that their unseen enemy has already chosen a target: the island paradise of Honolulu.

First, the book summary on the jacket because that is the only hope you have of following the plot, and second, the captions beginning each chapter that indicate where the characters are.Larry Bond's books have all been high quality novels, even though the last one he wrote wasn't as good. But he hasn't written anything in awhile then returns with this effort with co-author Jim Defilice. I don't know who wrote what, but somewhere along the line, they really botched this book up.The story involves a team that operates outside the law tracking terrorists. It has CIA man Fergeson, two special forces memberts Rankins and Connors and a marine called Guns. They are on the trail of terrorists trying to prevent a dirty bomb being set off in the USA.I seriously considered quitting this book after about 100 pages. At this point the problem wasn't the storytelling, but the horrendeous dialogue among the \"First Team\". I guess the authors were trying to add character to these people, but every other word was a joke or a lewd comment. This detracted from the story because it often seemed forced and out of place and incredibly unrealistic. I doubt soldiers trade crass jokes in the heat of battle.The horrible dialogue tapers off somewhat and then the horrible story takes over. The authors can't describe scenery at all and do a horrible job of telling the reader why characters are in Iran, then in Russia, then split up into teams, then together. Why are they following a train? Why do they stop? How do they get to a US airbase from following a train? Those easy questions are never answered.This book has the typical computer nerd working in a messy office at headquarters and he finds some useful info and shares it with the team in the field. Or at least I think he did. What he finds out and tracks makes no sense. The authors mention a May 11 memo. Where did this come from. Did I miss its introduction early in the novel?The president of the USA sends a sexy 26 year old attorney who amazingly has gone through special forces training out in the field to go with the \"Team\" and to make all key decisions. Ridiculous.The \"authors\" do a horrible job of setting up the premsis for the existence of the \"First Team.\" They do a baq job of writing characters and dialogue. They have no clue about telling a story.This book is horrible. Please don't read it!!!!!",

Unfortunately it's difficult to believe they cart all this stuff around in a truck as they do their \"secret\" missions in places like Chechnya.I've read other Larry Bond books and generally he's not bad.But \"Larry Bond's First Team\" is just plain awful. No plot; no believable characters; no suspense; no fun. By the end of this novel - if you get that far - you may well wonder as I did, why you wasted the time. My own rationalization is that it's like getting hooked on a really bad movie. It's so bad that you can't believe it gets worse. In the case of Larry Bond's First Team.

I immediately purchased this new novel as soon as available with great expectations. Alas, was not to be. This book was terribly disappointing, and a hard to finish reading. The story was choppy, the characters only cardboard cutouts that you could care less about. Nothing was in-depth and read like a book thrown together overnight by a couple of buddies over a beer. Even the hero, Ferguson, seemed more of an accident waiting to happen, and inept to say the least, to be leading a special forces strike team. Sorry Mr. Bond, but if this is the first book in a planned series, I surely hope that more thought and depth goes into the sequels. Try reading some Vince Flynn novels with hero Mitch Rapp to get the right idea of some great action stories.",

The Story didn't make much sense. The charactors were not developed, heck in most cases, the characters weren't even explained as to WHO they were. I have read EVERY other book by Larry Bond and this is the only one I thought was bad. In all of his previous books the charactors were very detailed and real. In this book the charactors weren't even good enough to be called two-dimensional. Mr Bond always seems to colaborate with someone when he writes (Patrick Larkin and Tom Clancy) and It is VERY CLEAR in this instance which parts were written by Mr. Bond and which parts were written by Mr. Jim DeFelice.Please Mr. Bond, drop the Co-authors and write your next book alone. I know that Mr. Bond has a new book due out in May, 2005. I only hope he has gotten back to his roots in telling good stories with believable charactors.",

                "review/text": "Those familiar with Harlan Coben's series featuring sports agent sometimes detective Myron Bolitar will delight in this gifted author's latest book, The Innocent. Joining other stand alone books of Mr. oben's like Tell No One and Gone for Good, this book takes its rightful place along with the above mentioned as being a hair raising roller coaster of a read. And one which I imagine most readers will love as I did when Mr. Coben's newest book around the asks the age old question, do we really and truly know the person we're married to. To day this is a really good suspsense book and will have yoru emotions going up and down as the suspsense mounts is an understatemnt.Matt Hunter is 20 years old when during a vacation from a college vacation, he is involved in a brawl and accidentally kills a college student. Although he ha dlittle do with instigating the fight and merely was trying to help a friend, Matt is found at the scene whiel others scurried away and stands trial for the death of another college student.While this most likely was an accident and he may be innocent he is found guilty by a jury and is sentenced to spend several years in prison. Needless to say, as a young suburban man, Matt is less than prepared for prison life but manages to stay alive. When he leaves prison four years later he is taken under the wing of his older brother,a laywer with a prestigious NJ firm which eventually hire Matt as a paralegal. But life for Matt as a convicted felon will never be the same.Now it is nine years later, Matt's brother is dead from a brainaneurysm and his father is also gone. Matt's mother andsister live far away but he still helps out his sister in lawand his two nephews. Matt also continues to work for the same law firm as before but he is now mrried to a wonderful woman, Olivia and they are expecting their first child.He is also about to close on a home in his old neighborhhod and Matt cn't help but think that life is good. But when his wife convinces him to buy two cell phones which can send pictures, this sets in motion a series of events which have Matt wondering who Olivia really is and why is his life spiraling downwards. on one otherwise ordinary day Matt's phone rings andthe sights he sees will once again change life as he knew it.And we as readers now embark alogn with Matt on a whirwind and well thought out plot stretching from New Jerey to Nevadawith a cast of characters we come to know and enjoy.This was a real good read, much better than Coben's last two books, No Second Chance and Just One Look, in my opinion. The characters are fully developed and we are privy to not only what is happening now but what happened to them in the past as well. Readers are able to feel all of the emotions as this story takes off and doesn't let go. One slight change from Mr. Coben's other stand alone books and main characters is that, Matt Hunter isn't quite as sarcastic as other characters found in this author's other books, ie Myron Bolitar This fact makes Matt a much more believable and vulnearble character. And as hardened as Matt may seem from priosn life,underneath we know that he can't believe the world he has made with Olivia is unraveling before his eyes.Harlan Coben's books at best are rather convoluted whichhas been one criticism which I have often heard about his books. I even found myself taking a few notes while reading his books to try and keep one step ahead of these well crafted novels. Overall, though, I found this book a bit easier to keep up with and if I didn't get all of the goings on at the end, Matt Hunter himself says there are some things he won't ever understand either. And this I can live with since I really enjoyed this book. If I had one small criticsm it would be that the end was a bit too coincidental as if the author decided to tie up the book with an ending which readers were hoping would happen.While I have read all of Mr. Coben's stand alone books I haven't read any of his Myron Bolita series books. I hope to read them this summer. And I also am anxiously waiting for Mr. Coben's next stand alone. he can't write them fast enough for me and I highly recommend his books.",

                "review/text": "McEwan creates well the atmosphere of a post-war, pre-wall Berlin, amplifying our imaginings. The interaction between Brits and Americans is full of subtle humor, and as it later turns out, great regard and humane understanding. The narrative is smooth and concerns an everyman, virgin, British geek assigned to an American intelligence project consisting of building a tunnel crossing the border into the Russian zone to tap underground phone cables through which presumably important matters are discussed (remember, we are in 1948, almost a decade before Sputnik). Love interest and sexual education is provided by an experienced German girl to our Brit, the virgin geek. The writing is so smooth that one doesn't realize one is turning pages and reading on at a rate as if one were reading a chock-full-of-events thriller when in fact not much is really happening; the tunnel is just chugging along. But McEwan is a \"smooth operator\" and he is moving you along, hinting at tension, to the point you are expectant of actions or revelations in the intelligence component of the novel to pop-up any minute and throw everything topsy-turvy.Rest assured McEwan is too smart to do that. Nothing happens as such that you are aware of for three quarters of the book until our everyman, the somewhat endearing British geek is plunged into a grand guignol not of his making and totally alien to the place where you would have expected the excitement you were owed to come from.(After all, you bought the book and it was sold to you as a thriller, and after all, it takes place in thriller-city and all major protagonists except two are freeks and geeks and goons and guards mostly in uniform and with varying levels of security clearance in the intelligence services of the powers which split this city. At times it looks as if each agent has his little black book which lists the interests they are called uypon to protect, investigate, eliminate, whatever, and thus move quickly about, talk with other similar blokes and keep moving about. The Tunnel provides a country-club of sorts for those connected with the project. There are body parts indeed, but they do not come from there.So, much activity occurs in our atmospheric tunnel, yes. But nothing happens there really. The unwelcomed death occurs elsewhere, has nothing to do with Military Intelligence. The neatly wrapped body parts do not bring the Tunnel down, it's the disguise they wear. But the story does not end there.Many years later a mature, no longer virginal Brit geek comes back to Berlin, post wall, to revisit sites, and carries with him a letter explaining what precipitated events at the tunnel and freed him of any trace of guilt, if any such he held.The explication at the end of the book is clear, surprising, and truly closes the nattarive in an intelligent, satisfying way.Endearing Love, after such an unforgettable opening and the obsessive development remains my favourite McEwan novel so far. Saturday is contrived, feels Thatcherite and stacked against the lower orders. Nonetheless I appreciated the medical tracts. (It's up for a Booker). In short, I liked \"The Innocent\" Better.",

I've proceeded to gobble up every stand-alone since Tell, but by the time I finished No Second Chance, his third stand-alone, I noticed Coben had employed THE VERY SAME TWIST IN EACH BOOK. Tell No One, Gone For Good, No Second Chance, Just One Look--the big mystery behind each pivoted on the same identical fulcrum. I wondered: \"Will he ever try something new?\"Enter The Innocent. I prayed and begged the gods of genre fiction that Coben had learned to flex his creative muscles. I bequeathed them burnt offerings as an intercession on Coben's behalf, that they would let the scales fall from his eyes and grow him to be more than a one-trick pony. Please, I wailed, please let The Innocent be different! No more of the same!But the gods must hate me.The Innocent has at its core the same schtick peddled in previous Coben stories which, for the sake of not spoiling your own reading, will not be mentioned in this review. The story had the twists and turns Coben's fans have come to expect, but in the end it seems he's grown quite content to re-gift the same gimmick to us time and again. Not only that, but The Innocent was his second most sloppily-written work behind Just One Look. His description resorts yet again to little more than telling as opposed to showing. The characters are better drawn here than in Look, the ever-present info-dump still frustrates--albeit not as madly as in Look--and the dialogue continues to be embellished and redundant. Furthermore, instances exist when the story FEELS like it's moving forward, but ends up staying in one place till the next chapter or the one after that. Comparatively speaking, Innocent was a welcome semi-return to form after Just One Look (a putrid piece of fiction). It doesn't stand up to Tell, Gone, or even Chance, or even most of the Bolitar series, but thank the fiction gods that at least we don't have to put up with Just One Look II: The Sideways Glance.The message seems to be, \"I'm Harlan Coben, I can take you for a ride, so I can grow lax in the areas not concerned with plot.\" He's since returned to his Bolitar series, and for that we can only hope his schtick has at last come to an end. Read this after Tell, Gone, and Chance (in that order), and skip Look. Be prepared, however, that the more you read his stand-alones the more you'll get the same ol' again and again.",

That is my main beef with this story. I could not enjoy myself spending time with this character or the circumstances. McEwan did a remarkable job in writing this and pacing the story, he just never gave us a character that we as readers could relate to.I have never read McEwan before, and I am looking forwards to trying my hand at another of his novels.

It's part psychological horror, part espionage, part mystery, part coming-of-age, part character study - and it's splendid.Set in 1954 in Berlin, before The Wall was built, it's the `true' story of the construction of a secret spy tunnel so the Brits and the Americans could spy on the Russians, whom they no longer trusted. Much to his surprise, Leonard Marnham, an extraordinarily innocent and nave British postal technician, is recruited to participate in this top-secret operation. A virgin at age 25, Leonard falls in love with a pretty German divorcee, and his initiation into the pleasures of a sexual relationship follows. The couples becomes engaged, but their world collapses into macabre horror on the night of their engagement party. The 80-plus pages that follow this horrific event are gruesome and spell-binding at the same time in a way that only a superb writer could possibly handle.The ending, leap ahead 30 years to 1986, feels a bit contrived and distanced, esp after the intense and personal material that's just been revealed.At its best, it rivals Pulp Fiction and Fargo for explicit shock value.

                "review/text": "\"Eureka,\" according to Webster's, signifies the discovery of something that brings joy or satisfaction. Thus, it is an appropriate title for the latest from William Diehl, a master of storytelling and suspense. Broadway, film and television actor Cotter Smith offers a finely articulated reading of this multi-generational tale.When Zeke Bannon was sent to fight in World War II some unfinished business is left behind - the mysterious death of one Verna Wilensky who was electrocuted in her bathtub. Almost as puzzling as her demise is her hefty bank account, fattened by anonymous cashier's checks from a bank in San Pietro, a Southern California town once known as Eureka.A few years and one Silver Star later Zeke is recuperating in an L.A. hospital when he is visited by his ex LAPD partner who has been investigating the Wilensky case. As Zeke digs into old files readers are transported to the Eureka of 1900, a hotbed of graft and prostitution. It is also a place where many secrets were buried.Jump start to today and popular Sherif Thomas Culhane, who seems certain to become California's next governor until his bid for office is jeopardized by stunning revelations.Diehl seamlessly weaves past and present to craft a story that keeps readers spellbound until the last.- Gail Cooke",

I cannot remember a read this good in a long long time.It took a great deal of self-discipline not to reread it immediately after finishing it. I was torn between reading it as fast as possible to see how everything was resolved or limiting myself to a daily ration in order to savor it for an extended period.Could not put it down and had to reread the last chapter at once.The characters come alive and you feel a part of the story. I was drawn into the era as the settings seemed atmospherically perfect. The plot is intoxicating, and just when you think you have solved a part of it; you find you guessed incorrectly.It is a wonderfully noirish, hard boiled tale. I felt the spirit of Raymond Chandler and hopes this becomes a movie. Mr. Diehl just gets better and better.It was worth the five-year wait.",

If I had finished this book 6 days ago, I would have put it alongside of John LeCarre's \"The Constant Gardner\" and Lehane's \"Mystic River.\" Forget any naysayers. \"Eureka\" is a eureka, a great mystery with wonderful conversations that smack of times gone by. An excellent novel.Growing up on the East Coast, I remember old guys who had fought in WWI. One fellow lived into his late 80's with one lung gone, having given the first one up to mustard gas at Belleau Wood. So there's a 'reaching' aspect of Eureka that transcends a number of years. And we really don't feel it. Diehl is able to interrupt conversations in the past, flash forward, come back chapters later to finish them. Very tricky; very well done.Diehl captures the chronology swiftly and smoothly. Sometimes he's writing of events a 100 years ago, sometimes 60, sometimes in between. \"The bohunk got ironed out in a hit and run.\" The dialogue is crisp and seemingly accurate. Very timely. Great conversations.Everyone who reads the reviews knows the plot by now. Honest cop, diamond in the rough, investigating the accidental electrocution of a widow in a 1940 bath tub, with only two things out of order: no will and \"100 large in the bank.\"A tough WWI veteran about to run for Governor, unanswered questions about the past igniting the future with a 40 year fuse. The quote from Gatsby, 'boats against the current,' is as prescient now as it was then.Some romance that might be too much but everybody finds someone sometime.The best dialogue is found in Elmore Leonard. Diehl gives him a run for his money in Eureka. Strongly recommended.",

I have been a big fan since &quot;Sharkey's Machine&quot; was published. &quot;Eureka&quot; does not dissapoint. It is an intriguing story with well developed characters and a feel of nostalgia for more simple times. With the story taking place in the first half of the twentieth century, the author does not have to bog down the story with a plethora of technical details. It is one of the few books I have read in quite awhile that was truly impossible to put down. It seemed easy to get caught up in the plot and the characters' lives. This novel is not as violent as some of his earlier works, but still has enough action to keep the reader interested. To me it was a good story and an enjoyable read.

Characters that we meet (like old Eli, Ben, Isabel) practically disappear after being introduced. Ben and Brodie are set up as best friends, but Ben is hardly a part of the 1940's segment at all ! Plus, we get this character Big Redd who plays such a pivotal part in the latter portions of the book, so why is he introduced so late in the story? This all just points to sloppy storytelling in my admittedly unimportant opinion.The romantic subplot also comes too easy, as two people (Zeke and Millie) who like each other come together with zero conflict. Millie's character lacks any sort of suspense or danger, or interest. And although there's a good twist about the first mystery that Zeke is investigating, the scene at the end where Brodie just \"tells\" Zeke a bunch of the answers he's been hunting for, is entirely too weak a revelation.Ultimately, it seems as if those ..., put too much stock in the author having had a bestseller before, or won some award somewhere. That has nothing to do with this book, which is both choppy and too long, anti-climactic, and full of the kinds of plot holes you might expect from a first time novelist. Though the main character of Zeke is likable, the book itself is not THAT well written, nor deserving of such \"five star\" praise.",

Someone puts an LP on the phonograph --- eight years before the long playing record was invented. William Diehl is clearly not big on research, quickly destroying the mood of this riff on noir mystery.It begins in 1945 and then flashes back to 1900. Eli Gorman and Shamus O' Dell own a good bit of land south of San Francisco. Unable to get along, they play a (totally unbelievable) poker game to see who gets control. Ben Gorman and Brodie Culhane, close friends, watch hidden in the loft. O' Dell loses but he has had his revenge already selling a local town, the Eureka of the title, to the evil Arnie Riker.Culhane, an orphan, leaves town for highly predictable reasons, becomes a hero in WWI, returns and becomes the deputy lawman until a shootout claims the life of the highly unbelievable Buck Tallman, an old-style Western town marshall.Tallman dies in a shootout at the local high-end brothel.Jump ahead a couple of decades and a woman is found dead in her bathtub. It seems accidental: a radio had fallen into the tub, electrocuting her. But the erstwhile detective Zeke Bannon is on the job. My, my: doesn't take long before the apparent accident is found to be a murder!And off we go back to Eurkea where secrets want to be kept. With Zeke Bannon on the job? Perish the thought --- though you may perish by the time you reach the end of this formulaic potboiler.It's not all that bad. Just riddled with factual errors, paper thin characters, a Tinkertoy plot that requires one small miracle after another to keep things going, a lot of totally unnecessary sex scenes and a surprise ending that is just plain silly.Perfect reading for a long flight or a rainy afternoon, but not much else to recommend it.Jerry",

Brodie grew up in Eureka, joined the Marine Corps, fought in the Great War and came home to become the town's sheriff.His mentor was Buck Tallman, a man right out of the old west, and we are told he was deputy for Wyatt Earp. While Buckman is a bit 2 dimensional, his presence lingers throughout the novel.Then there are Eli, Isabel and Del. Without spoiling anything, it is the stuff good sagas and generation novels are made of. By the time Mr. Diehl finished introducing Brodie, I really liked the character.The novel shifts to Zeke Bannon - a hardboiled detective working for the LAPD. He begins investigating an apparent accidental death that turns out to be a homicide and the trail leads him to San Pietro (Eureka's new name) and to Brodie. You see there is something dark and sinister in Brodie's past and while you really don't want something to be wrong. Mister Diehl continues to lay a body of evidence that points to Brodie.This is a very satisfying read, and it lives up to what I've come expect from this author.When my son asked me: \"What was the best thing he has written?\"I answered without missing a beat, \"Everything.\"",

And ain't that a big enough majority in any town?\" -- Mark Twain Ross Thomas chose the quotation from Huckleberry Finn as the text of his post World War II story as well as for the title. When Lucifer Dye is released from three months in a Hong Kong prison, debriefed, handed a false passport, a new wardrobe and a $20,000 check, his haughty control makes it clear that Dye's career with his country has been permanently terminated. But a good agent is always in demand, and just a few hours later Dye is being interviewed for a highly ingenious position. Victor Orcutt, although a not very good imitation of a British pre-war gent, has creative talents of his own. He has his sights a small southern city, with the ordinary run-of-the-mill corruption one would expect in such a place. The canny Orcott knows there's no profit in that . His creed is \"To get better, it must be much worse.\" He and his two associates have looked up Dye's history, and he now offers the ex-spy's a mission. For two and a half times the government's bounty, Dye is to thoroughly corrupt the town. And the sly Dye takes the offer.",

Thomas' novels aren't so much gritty as they are witty, and less about openly violent crimes as about deep corruption beneath the veneer of civilization.\"The Fools in Town Are On Our Side\" is one of the best Thomas novels. It's really about three or four stories all wrapped together. The stories all happen to be about the narrator, Lucifer C. Dye. Dye was born in Montana, but spent his childhood in Shanghai, China, before and during World War II. Story No. 1 is about how he came to be raised by a Russian-born madam running Shanghai's top brothel. Story No. 2 is about how Dye came to be the youngest Sergeant Major in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, largely on the strength of his perfectly fluent Mandarin (Chinese), and his subsequent recruitment into a government intelligence program. Story No. 3 is about how he got booted out of the program. And Story No. 4 is the main story, wherein he is offered $50,000 (it was worth a lot more back in 1970 when the book was written) to help \"corrupt\" a town, the idea being that in order to get the townspeople to vote for a reform slate, they have to be really fed up with corruption. That requires making things far worse so people see how bad the corruption is.Of course, Thomas does not tell the stories in that sequence. Instead, they're all mixed together, which ordinarily I find annoying, but each story is so interesting that the technique works here.There's a little bit of violence, but for the most part, the book is really about intrigue, double-dealings, and so forth. If you've never read anything by Ross Thomas, this is a great introduction.",

If a community becomes disgusted with rampant corruption in the ranks of its civic leaders, Victor will come in and clean things up. But Victor has found that before bad government can be reformed it has to first become even more corrupt. When the good citizens of Swankerton, a southern gulfcoast city, hire his firm to rid them of their thoroughly corrupt municipal government, he in turn hires Lucifer Dye to carry out the task of making the corruption worse.Who is Lucifer Dye? Why he's the novel's protagonist and first person narrator. Born in Montana and raised in Japanese occupied Shanghai, Lucifer's biography is an exceedingly interesting one. For the past decade he has been a spy stationed in Hong Kong.When the ultra-secretive intelligence agency he works for abruptly hands him his walking papers, Victor Orcutt is right there to provide employment for him on the Swankerton project.Lucifer's much anticipated work in Swankerton really doesn't get underway until the second half of The Fools in Town Are on Our Side. The first half of the book is largely about Lucifer's early life and his later tenure as an intelligence agent. Subjects which are both amazingly interesting to read about.This book deserves a 5 star rating for a number of reasons. The narrative is extremely compelling and substantial. There's lots of action including several instances of sudden, shocking violence. As in all Ross Thomas novels, almost all of the characters are imbued with cynical attitudes that are finely honed. In fact, the degree of cynicism found in the pages of this novel is a delight to behold and is probably its most engaging characteristic.The Fools in Town Are on Our Side is one of the author's best efforts.

It reminds me of some of the early books from Thomas Perry - particularly \"Metzger's Dog\".Take the title of the book: \"The fools in town are on our side\" - it comes from Mark Twain's book about Huck Fin who says to Big Jim that, if the fools in town are on our side, pretty much we've got the whole town on our side - I'm paraphrasing.Our hero - one Lucifer C. Dye - was born in the US, orphaned in Shanghai pre-WWII, and raised in a Whore House run by an escapee \"White Russian\" - Lucifer's Tante Katerina - and peopled by a \"United Nations\" of survivor ladies! In essence, the skills that Dye acquires here, later in the Shanghai prison, on the ship back to the US, in various schools to round out his education, and later in the \"intelligence business\" all blend to create a thoroughly fascinating character.

The universe is a dangerous place, a fact violently brought home to Frank Compton for perhaps the thousandth time when a stranger delivering a message dies right in front of him. An operative for Western Alliance Intelligence until his whistle-blowing activities got him fired, Compton is now being sought out by the Spiders, the robotic alien beings responsible for the upkeep and operation of the Quadrail transportation system, which connects the galaxy's twelve inhabited empires. The discovery of a sinister plot to use the Quadrail for ill has brought the Spiders to Compton-for only someone possessing the former agent's unique skills can stop the scheme for good. But when Compton leaves Earth behind-joining forces with Bayta, the Spiders' beautiful, half-human representative aboard the Quadrail-the terrifying scope of a vast, galaxy-wide conspiracy begins to reveal itself. Targeted on all sides by alien assassins of every shape and species, Compton and his enigmatic new partner are suddenly in a race against a clock ticking down to an irreversible doomsday, one in which the galactic night train will derail, carrying all members of humanity screaming to their deaths. The first in the Quadrail series from the Hugo Award-winning author of Blackcollar and many New York Times-bestselling Star Wars novels, Night Train to Rigel is an action-packed \"great read\" (Booklist).",

I've said often how I buy each one as soon as it comes out, knowing I'll get a fairly formulaic but also extremely exciting romp with some very clever plot twists.Well, outside of \"formulaic\", none of that describes this one. It seems like Zahn took the first half of The Icarus Hunt, perhaps my favorite of his, and removed all trace of humor and cleverness, then replaced the second half with something cliched and constantly, irritatingly predictable. Truly - the setup is EXACTLY the same, from the narrator having a shady job that the reader is not told, to a powerful and mysterious alien race controlling all of the transportation in the galaxy, to the main character recieving a job that is clearly more than it appears from someone with a hidden agenda, etc, etc. It does eventually go somewhere different from Icarus, but not somewhere good - instead, we're treated to a series of staggeringly easy to predict plot twists, resulting in a climax that, while somewhat enjoyable, is nowhere near Zahn's usual standards.Also, the Big Secret hanging over the story - what the narrator's original occupation was (this is constantly referenced in little side-comments, like \"Serving two masters is indeed possible, so I decided to take the second job\" and \"I was actually making progress on my original job, too, in a twisted way\") - turns out to be nothing more than, essentially, a punchline, revealed on the last page (though I'd figured it out well before).

                "review/text": "Set in a future galaxy in which interstellar travel takes place via the \"Quadrail\" which is a giant network of faster-than-light trains - yes, trains - running between solar systems. Spaceships are used only to travel within a solar system, e.g. between planets and the point in an inhabited system where the quadrail station is located.The quadrail was built 600 years ago and has been operated since then by a mysterious race nicknamed the \"Spiders\" who are part organic and part machine. Until now they have always tried to stand aloof from politics between other races. Apart from the spiders, there are twelve other intelligent races recognised as major powers by virtue of having at least five inhabited systems: the human United Nations, with exactly five worlds, is one of the least significant of these twelve powers.The story is told in the first person by Frank Compton, who used to be a top investigator for \"Western Alliance\" intelligence until he was fired for blowing the whistle on the bogus reports which had been used to justify the colonisation of Yandro, earth's fourth colony and hence the one which got UN officials the status of being a recognised empire.Frank has just emerged from a meeting at which he was offered a new job, when he is accosted by a young man who has just enough remaining strength to utter Frank's name before dropping dead with multiple bullet wounds. The message which the man has given his life to deliver brings Frank to the Spiders, who want him to investigate a threat to both the Quadrail and the Galaxy. They tell him that someone, they don't know who, appears to have found a way to smuggle warships through the Quadrail and is preparing to launch a war.Frank and his assigned partner, Bayta, who appears to be a human female but is very strange, begin to investigate. They soon begin to discover evidence of a vast and dangerous conspiracy which appears to threaten the entire galaxy - but is it the same as the one the Spiders warned about? And does Frank have a conflict of interest?Frank and Bayta are soon enmeshed in a complex web of intrigue in which nobody and nothing, including Frank and Bayta themselves, is quite what they seem.I had a little difficulty suspending disbelief in one or two of the ideas in this book - for example, how a railway network between the stars could be flexible enough to cope with the fact that stars move,and that the transfer stations would either have to orbit those stars or tend to fall into them. Once I'd got past that point and into the story I found it an entertaining and interesting read.Most of the other plot ideas are not as original as the idea of an intragalactic railway, although they way they are put together is unusual. I didn't feel the charactisation was as good as this author usually manages.Overall \"Night Train to Rigel\" is not up to the same level of brilliance as the best of Zahn's recent work such as \"Warhorse\", \"Deadman Switch\", or \"The Icarus Hunt.\" However, I thought it had a lot more going for it than some of the strongly negative reviews here make out, and I did enjoy reading it.UPDATE OCTOBER 2008\"Night Train To Rigel\" has been followed by a number of sequels and there are now four published or expected books in the \"Quadrail\" series, which are:1) \"Night Train to Rigel\"2) \"The Third Lynx\"3) \"Odd Girl Out\" and4) \"The Domino Murders.\"",

So I thought I'd give this most recent book a look, but I was never really engaged. I found the early setup interesting, but as the book moved along, I never really found myself taking much interest in the characters or the plot.The main character is Frank Compton, an ex-government agent for a futuristic Earth. He receives instructions from a messenger (murdered just after he delivers his message) to claim a ticket to ride a transit system called the \"Quadrail.\" This amazing transportation system can transport people to various star-systems in days, but nobody except its operators understands just how it works. Mr. Compton is soon asked to participate in a mission that could determine the fate of the galaxy and assigned a partner, the mysterious Bayta.This book has its fair number of twists and some decent action as well. The problem was, I never really felt myself feeling interested in what did or didn't happen with the various characters, or even with the plot in general. Zahn just doesn't seem to concentrate on the right aspects here to really capture the interests of the reader. It's almost as if he's \"phoning it in.\" Sure, I enjoy a nice, light read sometimes, but I do like to feel like I can actually take an interest in the affairs of the characters.",

                "review/text": "Timothy Zahn is one of our most reliable producers of traditional action-adventure SF. His latest adult novel is Night Train to Rigel. Earth is the twelfth of the Twelve Empires: twelve alien races linked by an explicitly train-like interstellar travel system. The system is run by the Spiders, inscrutable aliens who do not allow details of their FTL method to be understood by anyone. But they do allow races access to this transportation network -- for a price. And those races who have colonized enough planets become part of the \"N Empires.\"At first blush this setup seems transparently an excuse to use a silly title like Night Train to Rigel. But so be it -- there have been worse backgrounds for good SF stories! The hero is Frank Compton, a former agent for Earth's intelligence service who was cashiered for his public criticism of the expensive plans to colonize the last planetary system required to make Earth an \"Empire\" in the Spiders' eyes. As the story opens he is accosted by a murdered man, and offered a ticket to Yandro, Earth's controversial colony in the Rigel system. He accepts seemingly on impulse -- though we learn that he has accepted another job, its nature not revealed until much later.Once onboard the train, Frank is quickly apprised of the nature of the commission implied by his acceptance of the ticket. It seems the Spiders are concerned about a potential future war among the Twelve Empires: a war that they had hoped to prevent by their strict policy against taking weapons on the trains. Frank acquires a mysterious human companion, a young woman named Bayta who can telepathically communicate with the Spiders.Frank and Bayta begin a journey along the interstellar railways, looking for the unidentified warmongers the Spiders want to find. Frank quickly realizes they are the objects of interest of a variety of entities, including an alien Frank had known on his previous job, and also his former boss, a man whom he has cause to hate. They survive attempts on their life, and attempts to frame them for murder, and they seem to be herded towards the Sistarrko system, which includes a resort on one of a pair of gas giant moons, a moon which is home to the extremely popular Modhri coral. And there, of course, (this being the kind of novel it is) they learn secrets affecting the future of the Galaxy... and they are in the position to affect said future.I must say that for the first half of the book or so I was annoyed. Zahn seemed to be driving his plot by a series of absurd coincidences and unlikely actions. But to be fair, he is aware of all this, and by the end of the book things are explained in a satisfying manner. The central idea of the book, and the eventually revealed good guys and (especially) Bad Guy, aren't terribly new ideas, but they are fairly well handled in this context. The book is pretty enjoyable, though the opening sections do drag a bit. As I suggested, Zahn redeems some of the weaknesses of the beginning by the end, and I ended up a pleased, but not really thrilled, customer.",

It's the only book I've read of his that I actually think is bad. The character decisions are not too believable. There are some interesting aspects of the universe he tells about, such as the space trains. However, there isn't much told about those, and they don't really have anything to do with the story. The big mystery is regular Zahn kind of WOW how did you think of that, but all in all, this book is pretty bad. The dialogue is bad, characters are bad, believable factor is bad, and this really doesn't feel like Timothy Zahn's writing. Maybe he just had this idea and wanted to write it. I'm sure he has no problem getting published at this point. From any other author, this book would just be a failing statistic. I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it's Zahn. But this book was not good, it didn't hold my attention, and in the end it was a disappointment.I want to say again that Timothy Zahn is a great author, my favorite author who is still writing. Some excellent, highly recommended books are: Manta's Gift, Conquerors' Pride (first book of a great trilogy) and Heir to the Empire (even if you are NOT a Star Wars fan, this is the first book in a series that stands on its own).Zahn also has many great books that are out of print but available used, such as Spinneret, Warhorse, Deadman Switch, Triplet, and A Coming of Age. These are all excellent. Zahn truly has a unique imagination.",

                "review/text": "This is sort of a companion piece to The Icarus Hunt (by the same author). That book was a wonderful homage to Alistair MacLean, working all of MacLean's conventions into a classic MacLean thriller plot. But Night Train To Rigel is a bit different.There are multiple direct references to Hitchcock films (both explicit and otherwise). Much of the novel also has a generic Film Noir detective/horror story feel to it. But it still has a lot of the MacLean signatures as well.The plot is not quite as tight as The Icarus Hunt, and the initial misdirection is so big that it almost feels like two books grafted together once the real plot conflict is finally raised.The classic Pullman train setup is a wonderful image (sleeper cars and third class baggage cars to the stars at one light year per minute on a railroad through tubes connecting solar systems). But in the end it eventually comes off as something of a gimmick, used to justify all the conventions of the genre (like having to travel along the top of the train in order to reach a runaway engine).All in all, a good book if you know the background references that Zahn is playing with. As a pure standalone, though, I can understand the reviewers who thought the plot was overly complicated and overly driven by coincidences and deception. However, the same could also be said of many of the classic Hitchcock films which this book is trying to reference.",

                "review/text": "Night Train to Rigel (2005) is the first SF novel in the Quadrail series. It is set a few decades in the future after Earth has been admitted into the Galactic community through the Quadrail system. The station costs a trillion dollars to construct outside Jupiter's orbit, but it then provides access to many destinations throughout the galaxy.The Quadrail system is run by the Spiders, an arachnid-like species. The trains travel through tubes that connect to stations in other solar systems. The four-railed tracks are built around iridescent Corelines running down the center of each tube.In this novel, Frank Compton is a former agent of Western Alliance Intelligence. He was fired for blowing the whistle on the Yandro scam. Several scapegoats in the UN were publicly terminated from their jobs over the scandal, but Comptom was also canned six months later.Bayta is a mysterious woman who serves as Compton's guide and liaison with the Spiders. She communicates with the Spiders through a form of telepathy. Bayta obviously knows various secrets, but is more closed-mouthed than Compton himself.Korak Fayr is a Belldic commando officer. He and his men have apparently gone renegade, picking their own missions. Compton has a few encounters with Fayr before learning his status among his superiors as a loose cannon.In this story, Compton has found another job and makes the final arrangements with his new boss. Upon leaving the hotel, however, he finds a person waiting for him on the street. He says a few things to Compton and then falls over dead. The boy has multiple wounds that should have put him to sleep or killed him much sooner. Compton finds only two items on his person: a Quadrail ticket to Yandro in Compton's name and a cash stick.Since Compton was thinking of leaving Earth in the next few days, he just accelerates his departure. He catches the next flight to the Quadrail station. Along the way, he notices a young woman following the same route.Once he reaches the train, he finds his seat in the last passenger car. Actually, it has a single file of seats down the center with freight on both sides. It currently holds only six other passengers besides himself. As he starts reviewing his information sheets, Compton falls to sleep.Upon awaking, Compton finds himself to be the only passenger in the car. Then Bayta introduces herself and informs him that he is on the way to a meeting arranged by the Spiders. At their destination, Compton is briefed on a situation that the Spiders would like him to investigate.Compton is presented with an unlimited Quadrail pass, but is also forced to accept Bayta as his companion. Her ability to communicate with the Spiders convinces Compton to drop his objections. Then they are returned to their train. Compton is moved to a compartment next to Bayta's quarters.Strange things begin to happen during their journey. First, two drunk Halkas (who are not really drunk) knock on his door. Then the same Halkas break into a lockbox, steal a knife, and attack Compton.A Bellco drunk becomes friendly with Compton. Later the Bellco and his companions knock Compton unconscious and stuff him in a bundle of spices. Eventually Compton learns that the Bellco is Fayr.This tale leads Compton from one confusing incident to another. He begins to realize that he is being used as a diversion. Compton becomes very angry with Bayta on several occasions, but decides to continue his role despite her withholding information from him. Apparently he has no need to know.Despite his ignorance of the reason for their actions, Compton makes his own decisions. Bayta gets exasperated with him, but she follows his agenda. Eventually, Compton contributes more than the Spiders ever expected due to his Intelligence experience.This story combines high tech with classic cinema scenarios. Several Hitchcock movies are mentioned within the tale. The next installment isThe Third Lynx. Enjoy!Highly recommended for Zahn fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of innovative space transport, unexpected villains, and competent intelligence agents. Anyone who has not previously read books by this author might want to start withThe Blackcollar, his first novel.-Arthur W. Jordin",

                "review/text": "NIGHT TRAIN TO RIGEL(2005) is a fast read at 350 hardcover pages, and is generally quite fun. However, the interstellar train travel scenario is concocted at best, and absurd on introspection - which gives a unbelievable background to the whole book.The aliens are actually somewhat interesting, and the rest of the story is fairly intriguing and believable - but the whole thing just doesn't hold together well because of the forced early 20th Century style train travel backdrop.Having said all that, I think this book would serve well to teenagers first getting into interstellar SciFi. I would have really liked this book in Jr. High School. The problem is, this book is not being sold as a \"juvenile\", which it really is. I give NIGHT TRAIN TO RIGEL 2 1/2 stars.NOTE: It is worth mentioning that the heroine in this book goes by the same unusual name (Bayta) as the heroine in Isaac Asimov's FOUNDATION AND EMPIRE(1952), which was the best book in the classic FOUNDATION TRILOGY; this was somewhat bothersome to me, as an aficianado of Asimov, but might not be to others. I suppose it is also worth mentioning that Asimov was the first SciFi writer to successfully put out a good SciFi mystery - THE CAVES OF STEEL(1954); which is still my favorite SciFi book, after having read over 300. As NIGHT TRAIN TO RIGEL is another attempt at SciFi mystery, perhaps this was Zahn's way of subtlely giving credit to Asimov.",

A brilliant scientist on the planet Devanta has created a small universe contiguous to ours --and a utopian city on one of the planets. The question becomes, though, an utopia for whom? And why is a shady entertainment mogul subsidizing the scientist? More critical than that, does this new universe require the destruction of a portion --or all -- of our universe in order to grow and stabilize? Blaine Donne is a retired military special operative now devoted to problem-solving for hire. He investigates a series of seemingly unrelated mysteries that arise with the arrival of a woman with unlimited resources who has neither a present nor a past. The more he investigates, the more questions arise, including the role of the two heiresses who are more -- and less -- than they seem, and the more Donne is pushed inexorably toward an explosive solution and a regional interstellar war.

A prolific writer, he has invented a variety of universes, each a bit different, and he writes good economic- and politically-based science fiction. The quality of his writing can be pretty variable, and he cannot write a love scene to save his soul. But I still enjoy most of his books.But I had to work to even finish this one. The premise is promising: a male private detective in a society run by and whose royalty are women. But that premise is never fully developed. The private detective/protagonist also has a Dark Knight role, but that's never developed, either. He doesn't take assignments; he takes commissions. Hence, the title. And he does, indeed take the Elysium commission, even if he only figures it out afterwards. The rest of the novel is similarly fragments and undeveloped. The protagonist, as another reviewer has noted, is yet another iron-grey-haired guy who wears black a lot.And when the plot drops into military action at the end, you won't be the only reader who wonders wear that came from.Modesitt has written far better books. For example, the recent \"Eternity Artifact\" is superior in every way. This is a clunker.",

                "review/text": "The Elysium Commission (2007) is a standalone novel of the far future. Assuming that this novel takes place in the same universe asFlashandOctagonal Raven, it probably occurs about a millennium after the latter work.Devanta is a planet within the Gallian Subsector of the Assembly of Worlds. The Assembly has two main interstellar enemies: the Argenti and the Frankans. The Assembly has a nasty habit of reformulating worlds that become too repressive (and too independent); the results include restructured minds and disrupted societies.Devanta is ruled by a matriarchal hierarchy -- the Sorores Civitas -- which is widely viewed by other Assembly worlds as a repressive government. The City Sisters are not very democratic and have internal enemies, but they are fairly efficient and effective. Their Garda have active surveillance of all public places that discourages public crimes and strict regulations that restrain corporate corruption. Still, illegal acts occur off camera and off the books.In this novel, Blaine Donne is a former special operative for the Assembly. After his heroic exploits on Pournelle II, Donne was medically discharged from Assembly Special Operations and retired to Devanta. He became a consulting investigator -- private detective -- using his data analysis training to find lost persons and other such work. He also unknowingly becomes an urban legend as the Knight of Shadows, using his martial arts training to protect victims of back alley assaults.A decade or so after starting his new career, Donne receives a commission from Principessa Seldara Tozzi to investigate the future husband of her great-granddaughter. Marie Annette Tozzi is a surgical resident at the Medical College and is engaged to Doctor Guillaume Richard Dyorr, director of consciousness programs at the college. Principessa Tozzi believes that Dyorr is misrepresenting his sexual preferences to her great-granddaughter.Shortly after the principessa disconnects, Donne receives another client at his villa. Seigniora Reynarda wants him to investigate the connection between Eloi Enterprises, Judeon Maraniss, and Elysium. Donne recognizes Eloi Enterprises as the largest corpentity on Devanta providing explicit entertainment. Maraniss is vaguely familiar, but a data search provides only slightly more information. Elysium, however, generates so many hits as to be useless.Donne finds a message in his queue from Lemmy Jerome asking for assistance in finding out whether the Classic group is infringing his patents. Later, he gets Jerome on the vid and discovers that the patents cover jumpship navigation. Jerome sends him a device to detect the use of this patented technology.Then Donne receives a visit from his sister Krij and her partner Siendra. They have completed their regulatory compliance audit of his consultancy and have found a few problems that might cause a formal audit by the government. Krij also suggests that his unmarried state might lead to an audit; elder sisters will have their little jokes.Later, Donne pays a visit to the Principessa Odilia. She is a good source of information on many aspects of Devanta society, particularly on corpentities and the financial world. Besides a few tidbits of information, Donne receives an invitation to attend the opening of Hyperion at the opera. Upon returning home, someone takes a shot at him with an energy weapon.In this story, Donne takes on two more cases, one searching for a missing heiress and the other looking for the creator of several dramas. He makes full use of Max -- Time/Events/Systems Maximizer, Mod VIII, version two -- to search the various networks available to him, but finds little relevant information. He starts calling his various contacts.Donne quickly learns that the Eloi brothers are dangerous enemies. Other attacks follow, including one that he has difficulty in believing really occurred. After the Garda fines him three thousand credits for swimming in a restricted lake, he knows that something happened. The body of a deadly Aswaran wasp is the final evidence that forces him to accept that it wasn't just a dream.This story is very similar in some respects to two other works by this author: Flash (2004) and Octagonal Raven (2001). The main protagonist in all three stories is ex-military from a privileged family who owns a consulting business that provides analyses of information collected from the data networks. He has irritated powerful enemies who are now trying to kill him. He has a sister who worries about him. Other aspects, however, differ significantly, especially the socio-political settings and the technologies.Highly recommended for Modesitt fans and anyone else who enjoy tales of private investigations, personal combat, and understated romance.-Arthur W.

                "review/text": "The Elysium Commission is not one of L. E. Modesitt's better novels. I take a star off each for POV storytelling that is confusing, a plot getting wildly sidetracked for 80% of the book before making any sense, and a protagonist that seems to be a composite of any of his other science fiction standalones. I'm going to be generous and add back one star for some fairly interesting concepts in worldbuilding, so three stars.The world he creates is certainly different. Protagonist Blaine Donne lives in what seems to be a terraformed future world based roughly off of Italy and France that is dominated by the rich, ruled by women, and where nanite technology and societal acceptance allows routine enhancements ranging up to sex changes to those who aren't comfortable being themselves.Unfortunately, that's the only good part. The narrative is both confusing and badly developed. Donne is yet another one of Modesitt's repetitive retired Special Ops types (of course, also a pilot) who has become a private investigator in his medical retirement. Modesitt makes an unusual mistake for a writer of his experience in spending most of the book away from the main plot of what exactly the Elysium project is by investigating Donne's other cases, and then compounds it by throwing in occasional POVs from the nominal villain that make utterly no sense until he finally reveals at the conclusion what the villain had intended all along. Character development is stunted, with Donne's occasional Batman appearance as the \"Knight of Shadows\" never explained, his familial and client relations barely explored, and Donne's motivations just don't make a lot of sense - if he's doing this for money, why is he willing to effectively spend almost 3 million for 20 grand, let alone where did he get the 3 million to spend in the first place?Modesitt's typical one-man-conquers-all-and-gains-love-interest formula doesn't get used until almost the end, and while it may be a repetitive one it also normally works more or less as it does here. Unfortunately for Modesitt, the rest of the book doesn't. Modesitt is an unusually good fantasy and science fiction writer, but not in this book.",

And I own, and have read, everything he's published with the exception of the Ghost books - which seem to be out of print or otherwise unavailable. Enjoyment of this book was further reduced by my having just finished reading Flash; and the Elysium Commission is pretty much a retread of Flash; but murkier and not as well-told a story.The setting is only marginally different than Flash - it's a different world and nanite technology is less prevalent, but other than that there are no meaningful differences. The main character, Blaine Donne, is a 100% retread of the Flash's Jonat DeVrai - but more bland and less interesting. Another villian, another plot to foil... Modesitt has a tendency to cloak his villian's plots and the motivations behind them for a big reveal towards the end of the story - but in The Elysium Commission, I found that I really didn't care. The 'danger that must be thwarted' was so weakly explained that it was impossible to really get behind the hero's desire to stop it.And there were some huge glaring plot holes in text. The worst among them is Donne's \"Knight of Shadows\" subplot - where it is apparently an open secret that he goes out and does the vigilante bit. It was such an open secret that one minor character goes so far as to say, \"I wanted to see what a shadow knight looked like\" - or something to that effect. And cryptic references to another type of Robin Hood-like character didn't help. In Flash, the main character manages to retire from the military with certain sensory enhancements intact; in EC Donne's manages to buy, equip, and maintain a near military aircraft with everyone giving it a wink and a nod - think a Stealth Fighter without the missiles.Lastly, Modesitt has an extremely annoying habit in his SF writing - and that is creating and employing new words and acronyms and not supplying a glossary at the end of the book. This is an unforgiveable sin, and can make reading his work difficult and extremely annoying. I'm not sure why he does this; because this trait is not apparent in his Fantasy writing, where he goes out of his way to explain how things work. It's not uncommon to go 1/3 of the way through a book before he finally drops enough hints to let you figure out what a word actually means. In Flash, he finally resorted to one of his chapter opening \"study reprints\" he seems to be so fond of to explain one term; and in EC it's even worse.Do I recommend this book to you? Only if you are a hardcore Modesitt fan - and only read it if you haven't read Beauty and/or Flash recently; there are far too similar and EC doesn't compare favorably with either.",

Mr. Modesitt's strength is creating political/economic environments with strengths and weaknesses. He then sets his characters within these worlds as they approach a crisis. The Elysium Commission follows this formula.I enjoyed this book and recommend it. The main character, Blaine Donne, is a retired special operations agent/soldier who's been medically discharged after a botched mission. The book begins on his home world of Devanta where he now acts as an investigator/fixer for the rich and well connected. He accepts a mysterious contract to investigate the connection between a scientist, an entertainment mogul, and something called Elysium. Intrigue, murder, and political brinkmanship follow from there.The minor issue I have with this story and others by Modesitt are the main characters are almost always quiet, effective, have gray hair and green eyes, and typically dress in dark gray or black. Typically, the main characters will miss or misunderstand some salient point about his foes up to the point that it's almost too late, then they are forced into action to save the day. I've also come to the conclusion that Modesitt either doesn't know how to write a love interest into a story or always does the same variation on a theme here too.Don't get me wrong, I can easily overlook those points listed above because the political/social/economic parts of the books often provide that 'hmmm, I hadn't thought of that' moment.",

Cheradenine Zakalwe is not a Culture citizen, but he has been employed by the Special Circumstances branch of the Culture's Contact section as a mercenary, trying to influence conflicts on a variety of planets to be resolved in the direction the Culture prefers. As the main action of the story opens, Zakalwe has \"retired\" from SC. Diziet Sma, who has been Zakalwe's \"control\" in the past, is rudely summoned from her latest (quite pleasurable) assignment in order to find Zakalwe and recruit him for one more emergency mission (involving a situation with which Zakalwe was previously involved).From this point, the novel progresses in two main directions. The main branch of the story follows Sma forward in time, as she pursues and eventually finds Zakalwe, and as Sma and Zakalwe accomplish, in general terms, the mission on which the SC branch has sent them. This involves convincing a retired politician who supports the \"right\" side (anti-terraforming, pro-Machine Intelligence) of a conflict in an unstable star cluster to return to the arena and forestall a coming war, and then also involves some intervention in a \"brushfire\" which has broken out as a precursor to the war. This story is exciting and enjoyable, with plenty of Banksian action, Banksian scenery, and Banksian humor, the last as usual particularly embodied in the character of Sma's drone assistant, Skaffen-Amtiskaw. (Banks' machine characters are inveterate scene-stealers.)The second plot thread moves steadily backward in time (complicated by a couple of even-farther backward flashbacks), following Zakalwe's career as an agent for SC, back to his recruitment by SC and his war experiences prior to that, and finally back to his formative years as an aristocrat of sorts on a planet with roughly 19th-20th century Earth technology and social structure. This thread allows us to slowly learn more of Zakalwe's character, and of the traumatic events which have made him the rather tortured individual he is at the time of the main action. Thus, the novel's structure is at first blush mildly experimental. However, this structure is really logical, and essential to the reader's experience. Essentially, the main action is illuminated by our growing understanding of Zakalwe's past. And the use of Sma as a viewpoint character (despite her somewhat non-centrality to most of the action sequences) is a vital strategy: in a sense, she becomes a stand-in for the reader: and part of our understanding of the novel is trying to understand Sma's feelings for Zakalwe (which are not romantic at all, by the way), and to measure her Use of the Weapon that is Cheradenine Zakalwe in the context of Zakalwe's humanness, and in a sort of parallel or contrast to Zakalwe's expert use of a variety of weapons.The climax of the novel is a shocker. However, it's not just a \"surprise ending for the sake of the surprise\". It's crucial to our understanding of the book: and it gives the book meaning far beyond the (very good) adventure story it has been up to that point. The climax seemed to reverberate back through the entire book, giving new meaning to almost every incident. This is a book which almost demands immediate rereading. I think it is still Banks' best book, and one of the essential SF novels of the past quarter-century.",

                "review/text": "The majority of the Culture novels are uniformly excellent, with the only problem in some of them that the final twist is so odd that the book loses some of its impact, or the plot becomes so knotted that the book loses some of its coherance. Not so in this case. This novel tends to deal only peripherally with the Culture, but at the same time their presence infuses and infests the entire novel. Mostly it's the story of a non-Culture fellow who works for them in Special Circumstances (what a great euphemism) doing all the stuff they'd rather not admit to, starting wars, ending wars, waging wars, stuff that he's unfortunately good at. What makes this novel so brilliant is the tight and inventive structure, alternating between the main story itself and scenes from the character's past. All of it is wonderfully written and together they give not only an excellent view of the character in all his possibly dysfunctional glory, but also the rest of the characters (even the most minor character feels three dimensional), as well as a good cross-section of Banks' universe, both of the Culture and the civilizations that aren't part of the Culture. The final twist will change everything and sharp eyed readers will probably figure it out long before the end, although Banks is so good at misdirection and distraction that it barely occurred to me even as it came crashing down on the characters. Definitely his most consistently brilliant work, for once both structure and plot combine to create something that ranks as both first class SF and first class reading, period. If you've got a friend who's been hesitating on discovering Banks' works, give them this one and if that doesn't convince them, well then perhaps nothing will.",

Oh so clever, so interesting, so shocking - if I never did anything else in my life but write a book even half this good, I would die happy. To confirm what another reviewer said, if you haven't read science fiction before, don't start with this - Player of Games will be more understandable and will give you a frame of reference for Use of Weapons. Interestingly, although the book deals, at first sight anyway, with the business of war and of being a mercenary, of all the people I have recommended this to, women seem to get more out of it and are more enthusiastic then men - who have just enjoyed it rather than raved about it. If you like books that make you think, that need sustained concentration, that need you to be able to remember things from one chapter to the next, yet which are still an enjoyable read - read this, or any other Iain Banks book - you won't be disappointed.",

Wikipedia and Amazon finally let me jump into this pretty amazing series.Use of Weapons is a little frustrating. Its herky jerky, its story reads in fits and stops. Sort of like driving in a car with a new driver. The book is told with 2 time lines, (1) the main plot proceeds from the current time forward (Zak attempts to rescue and convince an aging General to aid the Culture and (2) the other is told backwards starting in the current time and going backwards - we see Zak thru various missions to before he begin as an agent of the culture.Frankly, the backwards moving story line, clever as it is, really disrupts the flow of the main plot. The main plot builds wonderfully well. Very clever and interesting and Zak and Sma are fun, interesting characters. I really enjoyed this story line - its exciting, clever, even humorous at times.The backwards story line just attempts to fill in the story behind Zak, where he came from, what he was before becoming a Culture agent. The main prob here is every single chapter of the backwards line is self contained - and each one takes several pages to \"re-orient\" yourself. Most of those start with Zak in deep water after some mission that went badly. I found myself sighing at these chapter and really looking forward to the progressive chapters.I think this book would have been much better with fewer backwards story lines. I don't think I mentioned that for every forward story chapter there is one backwards story chapter. A clever lesson in fiction writing but makes but a train wreck to read. Its not confusing mind you, it just really breaks the flow of the main story.But hey, I paid $1 for it.",

Zakalwe has a troubled past, and it is never made quite clear why he was chosen by the Culture to be their agent because he is usually brooding and borderline incompetent. A side story involves Sma, an oversexed female agent of the Culture who has to interrupt her orgy-filled lifestyle to find Zakalwe and bring him to some other guy to stop a war on some planet....*Yawn*I really tried to get into this book, but the characters are just too shallow and uninspired. It's also difficult to empathize with agents of all-powerful organizations who jump from planet to planet-- it's all too much like watching an ant farm. Even when Zakalwe is on death's door, Banks has trouble making anyone care. Also it doesn't help that several times in the book Zakalwe is basically dead and then rescued by the Culture: the absolute worst is when his head is cut off and then retrieved...give me a break! Zakalwe's backstory is told through muddled flashbacks that further disconnect you from any semblance of a narrative, like several painfully boring SF short stories strung together.Use of Weapons drowns in its own overdone prose: endless descriptive paragraphs on sunsets and cityscapes followed by small snippets of neutered action sequences and spare, dry dialogue. The majority of the book is spent with Zakalwe brooding in one way or another: staring at a pen floating in zero-G, hallucinating in a drug haze, staring out a balcony. By the time you find out what he's so troubled about you hardly care; and it's hardly the horrific epiphany you expect after the 400+ page build up. The only use for Use of Weapons is as a sleep aid for insomniacs.",

The book has a very Bankian structure, with the prologue happening somewhere in the middle of his life, and then the chapters that advance the plot alternating with his mercenary adventures going backwards until they reach the moment with The Chair, and The Ship... and the moment when Zakalwe became Zakalwe.The structure and pacing of this novel is quite similar to that of Banks's first book, The Wasp Factory. The ending twist is not as well handled, but the horror event that precipitates is every bit as disturbing, perhaps even more horrific, than the one in The Wasp Factory, and mercifully the twist in Use of Weapons is left doubly ambiguous. We may never know who was telling the truth. And that's probably for the best.Use of Weapons is a literary masterpiece, Banks can draw pictures of misery, horror, indulgence and excess with a minimum of effort, and he succeeds somehow in making it all fit together. It's not the clockwork mastery of Bujold, but something more organic, more humane, even while you realize that his underlying themes are as ruthless, vicious, and inhuman as any you can imagine.A lot of Banks's later works, like the almost irrelevant Excession, don't deserve much attention. But Use of Weapons is Banks at his best. The Wasp Factory had a happy ending, of a sort; I can't say that about Use of Weapons. The Wasp Factory stayed with me for a long time, though, and made me feel depressed and horrified at the state of the world, despite the discoveries its plucky and interesting protagonist went through. I highly recommend Use of Weapons for the same reason I recommend The Wasp Factory, but be prepared to be depressed for a long time afterwards.",

As you put the book down though, you can be sure, the book stares back.Banks turns every erg of incredible creative engine to creating a masterpiece. The characters and plots reveal themselves slowly through a dance of vignettes and scene changes. As we are taken through different points of view, flashbacks to different times, connections to previous scenes, we never lose sight of the characters themselves or the story they are caught in. Others have used the form, but Banks is a master of the craft. Add to this deft style a majestic background of an intriguing and delicately crafted space opera, and you have a book that should stand at the pinnacle of the science fiction genre.The net effect of Banks' interwoven tale is to draw us, so slowly and sensually that we don't even realize it, into exploring the defining essence of an old warrior's life. And it is only too late that we realize the shadow's have lengthened, the clouds have covered up the sun, and the grass beneath our feet has withered in the cold wind. What we find in that cold and lonely place, what we learn in the end ... is sublime.Banks excels at darkness. He excels at making it funny, at making it interesting. And he excels at showing how the darkness within his characters defines them and fuels what good they do. In this book he pulls out all the stops.Read it.

Well, Banks does not disappoint, although I wonder about the mental state of anybody who would dream up something like that.

Cheradinine Zakalwe, Diziet Sma and Skaffen Amiskaw are, together, his most interesting group of characters.The structure of this novel makes it worthy of note on its own. Written in interwoven chapters, it is made up of two alternating narrative streams - one indicated by Arabic numerals and the other by Roman ones. One moves forward chronologically, while the other moves in the opposite direction; yet both are about the central, tragic character, Cheradinine Zakalwe.Despite being the third of Banks' \"Culture\" science fiction novels to be published, he wrote a much more complex version of this story in 1974, before any of his books saw print. He later said it was so complex it \"was impossible to comprehend without thinking in six dimensions\". He credits fellow Scottish author Ken McLeod with getting him to sort this baroque novel into a publishable form.Zakalwe is a rogue, a military genius, an assassin, a sad case and an utterly sympathetic character all at the same time. A mercenary shaped by his experiences as the perfect soldier, he's taken, refined and utilised by the supposedly benign and pacific Culture for their nastier dirty tricks operations. The moral ambiguity and ethical contradictions of this are not lost on Zakalwe himself or on his Culture handler, the \"Special Circumstances\" operative Diziet Sma.Gloriously grostesque, sharply observed, bleakly satrical and written with Baink's unique ability to make the most vile aspects of war and violence lyrically beautiful and richly ironic at the same time, this is the great Scottish master at his finest.A book to loan to anyone who thinks science fiction is \"dumb\".",

This structure was distracting the first time I read the book; on second and third look, it gives the work an audacious complexity few authors dare try (and, unfortunately, few readers bother with). This may be the ultimate example of an episodic novel, unfolding as it does in a dizzyingly imagined series of often unforgettable set pieces. Stunning imagery, compelling characters, vast scope set against rich detail, and a liberal scattering of black humor....wow. Maybe not the best book i've ever read (\"Dune\" still holds the title), but a solid bet for number two.",

        "description": "\"An absolutely sensational historical thriller-with an ending so shocking that I literally jumped up out of my chair!\"-Max Byrd, author of Grant New Year's Eve, 1945. The assassin steps out of the Atlantic Ocean in the middle of a raging nor'easter. Cool and efficient, she's a weapon of war superbly trained in the ancient arts of subterfuge and murder. And even though she's outnumbered, she's got one major advantage: No one knows she's coming. Professor Mikhal Lammeck' s specialty is the history and weaponry of assassins. But even Lammeck is caught off guard when the Secret Service urgently requests his help: A gruesome double murder and suicide in Massachusetts has set off alarm bells. It's only a hunch, but all too soon Lammeck suspects the unthinkable. In the waning days of the war, someone wants one last shot to alter history. An assassin is headed to Washington, D.C., to kill the most important soldier of them all: the U.S. commander in chief. As Lammeck and a killer at the top of her profession circle the streets of the capital in the hunt for FDR, one of them will attempt to kill the world's most powerful man; the other, to save him. And between them, for an instant, history will hang in the balance. . . . Praise for The Assassins Gallery \"Provide[s] thriller readers with one of their best reads of the year. . . .

                "review/text": "\"The Assassins Gallery,\" by David L. Robbins, is a historical thriller set during the early months of 1945. Professor Mikhal Lammeck poses the question: \"Can a single man change or direct the course of history?\" during the first session of his class at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Although the professor is fascinated by the whole \"bloody mess that is human history,\" his particular field of expertise is the political killer or assassin. Lammeck has begun to write a treatise on assassinations, but, after five years of work, the book remains unfinished. Adding to his already heavy workload, Lammeck spends time in the Scottish highlands instructing clandestine teams of highly trained British operatives who work behind enemy lines. However, all of his activities are put on hold when Lammeck receives an unexpected visit from an old friend, Dag Nabbit.Nabbit is with the American Secret Service, and his job is to protect President Franklin Roosevelt. After two civil defense wardens are killed while patrolling a remote Massachusetts beach, Nabbit and his superiors suspect that a deadly intruder has infiltrated the country to kill FDR. They want Lammeck to lend his expertise in the hunt for this would-be assassin.The author provides some interesting facts about famous assassins in history, and he repeatedly raises questions similar to the one that the professor asked in Scotland: Do people mold history or are they history's unwitting pawns? By killing a head of state, can a single individual accomplish what years of war cannot? Trying to change the direction of world events is an exotic looking woman from Cairo who calls herself Judith. She has been hired to rid the world of FDR, and Robbins follows Judith as she settles into Washington, D. C. and formulates her strategy. Lammeck tries to outthink his wily opponent, but he gradually realizes that he is facing a formidable, dangerous, and tenacious foe.Robbins energizes \"The Assassins Gallery\" with lively characters and sharp dialogue. Lammeck, for all of his scholarly interest in political violence, is a thoughtful man with a conscience, for whom killing is theoretical. Judith, on the other hand, is a cold-blooded sociopath who has few qualms about eliminating anyone who stands in her way. The paths of these two very different people will inevitably cross, but who will emerge the victor? The secondary characters are nicely drawn, as well, from a neurotic political wife for whom Judith works as a housekeeper to an elderly neighbor who shrewdly sees through Judith's lies. The author includes thoroughly researched tidbits about FDR's affection for Lucy Rutherford, and the scenes featuring the president, devastated by illness and surrounded by his loved ones, add flavor and poignancy to the story.There are a few predictable elements in this novel, including the obligatory high-speed chase scenes and near-misses that we have come to expect. However, Robbins goes way beyond the obvious, and the suspense builds excruciatingly as Judith edges closer to her goal. \"The Assassins Gallery\" provides satisfying entertainment and a refreshingly original conclusion, with several loose ends that are purposely left dangling. Robbins, it seems, agrees with his fictional hero that world events can never be tied up in a neat package.",

The Assassins Gallery is very fast-paced and suspenseful, while blending in some interesting historical information about assassins, FDR's private life and some thought-provoking issues. All in all, Robbins's writing style will keep you glued to your seat to find out what happens next ... but, with the exception of the ending, you'll probably be able to accurately predict a lot of what happens. This, however, will not detract from this exciting thriller. The one major criticism I did have with The Assassins Gallery, and which kept me from giving it a 5-star rating, is the relative ease with which the main \"good\" character is able to determine what the assassin is planning to do as well as of the relative ease with which the \"bad\" character, the assassin, is able to manipulate everyone she comes in contact with. Nonetheless, The Assassins Gallery should be Robbins' \"break out\" book and help get him the large audience he deserves.",

Robbins's latest historical thriller as a rewriting or perhaps a recasting of Frederick Forsyth's classic THE DAY OF THE JACKAL. This should only arise as the result of failing to read THE ASSASSINS GALLERY, an engrossing, riveting work that needs to be judged solely on its own formidable merits.THE ASSASSINS GALLERY is set in the closing months of World War II. Suspicions have arisen that an increasingly ailing Franklin Roosevelt may be the target of an assassination attempt. Mikhal Lammeck, an expert in the history of assassinations and a special ops instructor, is clandestinely recruited by the Secret Service to determine if such a threat exists and, if so, to thwart it. Lammeck, a United States expatriate residing in Scotland, is initially reluctant but soon becomes engrossed in the hunt for the assassin, who by appearances is as unlikely a murderer as Lammeck is a hunter.The killer, whom we come to know as \"Sarah,\" is a master of subtle disguise, recruited by an unknown principal to assassinate the most powerful man on earth. Utilizing her looks to pass freely between the black and white community, Sarah is able to slowly but inevitably work her way toward the White House, turning culturally imposed limitations and barriers into strengths while using her own formidable skills to turn Lammeck from the hunter into the hunted.Robbins's dialogue is absolutely first-rate, capturing the nuanced cadence of the early to mid 1940s. He also deftly weaves his way through the crazy quilt patchwork of race relations during the mid-twentieth century. Washington, D.C., where the majority of the novel is based, was officially not segregated, yet people of color were assigned to second-class status. Robbins takes this point of fact and utilizes it as a key element of his work, fashioning it as a camouflage from which his villain of the piece can operate. These and other elements move the book out of the \"what if?\" category of fiction into the \"maybe so\" area.THE ASSASSINS GALLERY will be of special interest to those who study American history, but any fan of thriller novels or of strong characterization will find much to enjoy here. Highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub",

                "review/text": "As the countdown ends 1944, Judith comes ashore from the freezing water off Newburyport, Massachusetts into a Nor'easter. When a two-person civilian patrol stops her on the beach, Judith tries a bluff, but when that fails she kills them. Judith cannot find her murder weapon, a twelfth century knife belonging to enemies of the Templars during the Crusades. Still the enemy agent knows stealth remains her major weapon so no one must know who came ashore.The murders on the beach upset the Secret Service, who assume a plot against President Roosevelt by unknown assassins. Agent Nabbit obtains the help of his former history professor Mikhal Lammeck, who concludes by the murder weapon used that the killer is a professional who will slay anyone remotely in his or her way. He assumes like Dag that FDR is the target. So he waits patiently in DC for the assassin's arrival, not realizing a female is the cold blooded killer and that she is already on the staff of Roosevelt's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherford, but beyond stopping the assassin Lammeck wonders who hired her.David L. Robbins provides a fascinating historical thriller that uses an electrifying plot to enable the audience to look deeply at 1945 DC. The story line is action-packed so that the thriller crowd will sit on edge throughout, but also includes interesting tidbits. For instance many people by his fourth term thought Roosevelt was a benevolent dictator whose popularity was waning as the war seemed endless, but feared switching administrations (when will we begin hearing the noise to change the twenty-second amendment?). Lammeck is a well-rounded hero struggling to stop an assassination and uncover a conspiracy, but also relaxes by exploring his favorite subject, what is history, which ultimately is the underlying theme of this delightful thriller.Harriet Klausner",

                "review/text": "\"... you had a gun on me twice, and both times you let me go. A girl gets to appreciate that sort of thing.\" - from THE ASSASSINS GALLERYMy first chance at THE ASSASSINS GALLERY was the initial thirty-six pages I finished on AMTRAK's Southwest Chief on the overnight leg from Los Angeles to Albuquerque, where I disembarked from the train and mistakenly left the book behind to continue on to Chicago all by itself. This was no small loss as I'd been hooked by what I'd read so far and thus had to purchase a second copy once I returned home. (I just hate it when that happens, don't you?)In the opening chapter, a mysterious submarine surreptitiously drops off a passenger on an isolated stretch of the Massachusetts coast on January 1, 1945. The intruder, after skillfully but brutally killing two unlucky Civil Defense coast watchers, goes to the nearest town, obtains a car, and sets out for Washington, D.C. The mission: to kill the President of the United States.One member of the Secret Service detail assigned to protect the Chief Executive is Agent Dag Nabbit, once on loan to, trained by, and operational with the British Special Operations Executive. (Dag Nabbit? Author David Robbins must be kidding. How about Holy Moses, Jumpin' Jehosephat, Gosh Darn, or my personal favorite, Oh S--T?) Nabbit, having come across the police report from Massachusetts concerning the double murder on the sands, suspects something sinister is afoot. So, he gets from the SOE the loan of his former instructor and historical expert on assassination techniques, Professor Mikhal Lammeck, to help with the investigation.The author's previous works of fiction are centered on World War II. The first three skipped around the Eastern Front (Stalingrad, Berlin, Kursk), and the fourth takes place in Europe on the Western Front. THE ASSASSINS GALLERY also has the war as a backdrop, but at the distant vantage point of the U.S. capital. Here, the plot is ultimately keyed to an historical event, Franklin Roosevelt's death at Warm Springs, SC on April 12, 1945, ostensibly from a brain hemorrhage.The promise of the first 36 pages held up; the volume teetered on the edge of being in the couldn't-put-it-down category until the end. The confrontation between the assassin and Lammeck at a full-dress reception at the Peruvian embassy was especially clever and worth the price of admission - paid twice as you recall. And the identity of the government payrolling the assassin was a nice twist. There were, however, irritations that caused me to lop off a star.One of the biggest thorns in America's side in today's era of radical Islamic mischief is Iran (Persia). So, as if the author's publisher wanted David to make THE ASSASSINS GALLERY topical with current times, the unlikely villain of this piece is a Persian, Moslem assassin adept in the use of knife and poisons. What's more, her name is ... Judith. Okey-dokey. (Lucky we're not now in confrontation with Alaska; the Bad Gal would've been an Eskimo named Gladys with a harpoon.)I also wasn't engaged by the main protagonist, Lammeck. Rather than coming off as heroic, he presented himself more as a whiner. And his relationship with former student Dag, rather than being congenial, was a continuing source of annoyance to both and to me. Actually, the most interesting and engaging character was Judith; she deserves her own series, something which Robbins makes possible, especially if she continues to stalk American politicians.",

I also enjoyed Mikhal Lammeck's character, flaws and all. Even the sometimes cantankerous Mrs. Beach(assistant to the Secret Service supervisor Mr. Reilly) was starting to grow on me.

                "review/text": "One thing that ticks me off about after-the-bomb books is weak research on the effects of nuclear weapons, or on operational plans and capacities. This book suffers from that fault, despite good writing and a nice plot.Apparently the &quot;Cuban War&quot; of 1962 results in the US getting hit by something on the order of 10-12 Soviet nukes. This is reasonable, if slightly pessimistic. (My own guess would be something on the order of 6 or 7.) The Soviets simply didn't have many delivery systems which could reach North America.Two things aren't reasonable:First, after losing 3 or 4 cities and a few military bases, the US is shown as still devastated ten years later, with widespread areas dangerously radioactive and the economy only just recovering from a near-total collapse.Not!My father stood in a slit trench 1.8 miles from ground zero during a bomb test in the late 1950's, and he's fine at age 83. Yeah, if you're under the immediate fallout plume from a multimegatonne ground-burst, it's game over. But two weeks later, the same territory is pretty safe; a year later, virtually completely so. Most active isotopes have very short half-lives. There are exceptions (strontium-90, some metal isotopes), but there were scores of above-ground tests, and the increase in the cancer rate nationwide was undetectable without fairly sophisticated statistical analysis.Hiroshima and Nagasaki were reoccupied immediately after the explosions. Generally speaking, ten years after a bomb goes off you can go to ground zero, strip naked, rub the dirt all over your body and eat it with a spoon, and all you'll get is a dirty skin and indigestion.Hence the US, with a largely undamaged infrastructure, would recover quickly. Germany and Japan did, from far worse damage -- they don't call 1945 &quot;The Year Zero&quot; in Germany for nothing, and the damage in Japan was worse. The firestorms in Tokyo and Dresden killed about as many people as nuclear attacks, and did as much physical damage.Second, the USSR did have a very dangerous launch capacity in 1962... only it was aimed at Central and Western Europe, and the book shows those areas getting off scot-free.Not going to happen. Not even remotely possible. The missiles and bombers were set to go and would have launched immediately against European targets when SAC went into action against the USSR. Western Europe was chock-full of USAAF bases, just to start with; and the Soviets planned for a city-busting strategy, as well.They certainly weren't going to let the _Germans_ come through intact, for Christ's sake!As the joke went in the 1950's and early 1960's, the Soviet Union's deterrance capacity could be summed up as: &quot;If you Americans attack Holy Mother Russia, we will nuke the hell out of Germany, France and Britain! Just see if we don't!&quot;Britain, for instance, would have lost at least a dozen major cities -- and given the dense population and restricted area, would have been an absolute charnel house.The actual result of a nuclear war in 1962 would be:Moderate damage to the US. Moderate if you didn't happen to be in NYC or Washington, that is.Total devastation of the USSR.Very severe damage in Europe.",

                "review/text": "\"Resurrection Day\" is a mystery novel set in America a decade or so after the nuclear war resulting from the Cuban Missile Crisis. The real mystery however is how one man wrote a book that starts so well and goes so wrong. Opening with a flourish of details about the now shattered and crippled US of A so perfectly nuanced in their detailing of the fried and irradiated nation that one can't possibly fault the dated attempts to write Anglo-dialog for its british characters or how blatantly the author rips off from the far superior \"Fatherland\". In RD, far from backing down from the brink of nuclear warfare, the Yanks and Ruskies went toe-to-toe. Though details are scarce, eveyrbody seems to blame the now assumed dead JFK. (Imagine a world in which Dallas, 1963 never happened? No disco, no bell-bottoms or mood rocks? About the only history left pristine was the collapse of South Vietnam). Though scarred by the war, America is its victor - with Russia bombed back to Tsars. The only real winners were the Europeans who somehow managed to avoid being dragged into the war or at leats catch some of its heat. Still armed with nukes, the US's situation approximates that of the former USSR - were too poor to survive, but too powerful to be left for dead. We're also an embarrasing joke for the rest of the world: even foreigners profiting at America's expense silently pine for the great USA of old. Though the war as described here was actually quite limited, Dubois describes an America in a state of collapse, with whole territories considered lawless zones, and martial law becomes the rule. All newspapers are subject to military censorship and, for good order, are staffed with army vets - guys not prone to buck the system. Though it's business as usual a decade later, the author throws in a plot of something brewing: the murder of a visiting Brit who may be on a secret mission; the dissappearance of a vagrant who may have been on JFK's honor guard; the heralded re-opening of Manhattan Island (left sealed off and supposedly deserted since 1962); more secret machinations from the British and also those of the powerful General \"Rammer\" Ramsay, and hints that the truth of October, 1962 may somehow turn up.Then it goes bad. I'm not sure where, but the author soon takes a turn for the trite. Dubois' hero/Detective is Carl Landry, an ex-soldier who writes government-sanitized news in Boston. Landry's job seems guaranteed to engender in Landry an evolved acumen for investigation, primed to turn the soldier into a true detective. Instead, Landry becomes less an active investigator than a poor shmo powerless to ignore the steady stream of conspiracy theories that come his way. Dubois gives his hero no sense of disbelief and therefore deprives the reader of any sense of surprise. Dubois's JFK never rises above being the same product of the Camelot myth - eventually enjoying a sort of fulsome praise that undermines this novel as an objective mystery. By the same token, General Ramsay never becomes more than an uninspired fictionalized version of General Curtis LeMay, the hawkish USAF Chief of 1962. Though popular, the General is the object of suspicion that Dubois practically telegraphs from the moment his character is introduced. (Popular blame for the war falls squarely on JFK and his circle; but the sentiment seems forced, making it obvious that conventional wisdom is in for a painful reasessment). Though billed as a mystery-alternate history in the \"Fatherland\" mold, Dubois never ties in the disparate elements of his story to the alternate history as Harris had in that other novel. There are none of the historically ironic moments of \"Fatherland\" (my favorite being a murder victim whose criminal history amounts to a disturbance at a beer hall in 1922). Dubois spends so much time crafting his alternate history to match \"Fatherland\" he almost completely forgets the deft connection between the mystery and the history and the historical figures who live through both. Few of the characters are developed beyond being foils for Landry, and some details are painfully wrong - when Landry and his british lover meet and relive the story of WWIII, despite the hardships of daily life in post-war America coupled with censorship appropriate to a police state, Landry is actually better informed on the subject than she is. Also, unlike Dubois, Harris used real figures taken out of their historical context (one of whom, strangely enough, is an altogether different President named Kennedy, and not one anybody will be comparing to King Arthur).It is in its climax that \"Day\" compares least favorably with \"Fatherland\". The latter of the two books has no happy ending, only the willingness to look the Holocaust square in the face. In comparison, by the end of \"Day\" the main charachters pal around, pat each other on the back and congratulate themselves for successfully re-writing history, i could almost hear the laugh track and the strains to the MASH theme. A major botch - nuke this book.",

As one of the baby boomers who can still remember air raid drills as a schoolboy in Queens, New York City I found the passages about the Battle of New York , the &quot;lost&quot;children in the schoolbuilding basements , and P.S.19 both plausible and probable . Living in an age when its become cynically fashionable by the historical revisionists to sneer at the idealism of the Kennedy Era I found this story of Grand Tragedy and Heroism to be compulsive reading. The style with which the alternative history of this tale is deftly told puts this book at the head of its class. Great adventure, mystery, history, and storytelling all roled into one----H.G.

                "review/text": "Resurrection Day was full of promise to be one of the most interesting tales told this year. The premise is fascinating. What if the Cuban Missile Crisis had escalated into all-out war and the United States had been hit with nuclear weapons?With this premise, Brendan DuBois presents us with a cast of characters that could inhabit the devastated landscape one might find ten years after such a tragedy. Unfortunately, the characters are predictable, more types than individuals, and the plot unfolds according to the formula. The picture DuBois paints is somewhat interesting, but his execution falls far short of the promise.Carl Landry is the protagonist of this tale. Now a reporter for a censored version of the Boston Globe, he is an ex-veteran, a man who joined the Army in the flush of enthusiasm that accompanied the inauguration of John F. Kennedy. He served in an obscure country called Vietnam and lived to see starvation in California. In Carl's world, American survivors envy rich Canadians and rich Mexicans. He is joined on his search for truth by Sandy Price, British reporter for the Times, the obligatory love interest and temptress who is not completely what she seems on the surface.Disappointingly, this book offers nothing more than a simple morality play of the good people versus the large and malignant forces of the government. Our hero faces impossible odds, and it is not all that difficult to imagine how things are going to play out in the end.For readers who do not mind the predictable nature of the story, Resurrection Day does paint an interesting picture of a devastated landscape, of a country that is bowed but not broken. Read for what it is, a mass market paperback, it is not all that bad. Readers who expect something new or different, something at all challenging, are likely to be disappointed.This is a good book for a long airplane trip or for someone who wants a break from challenging books. It's mildly entertaining, but not at all a keeper.",

And some of the characters are predictable ~~ much to my chagrin. But if you're looking for a really good &quot;what if&quot; book, this is it.I was born way after the Bay of Pigs incident and the Kennedys I know of are the ones I read about ~~ John John and Caroline. Oh yes, Senator Ted Kennedy. So, when I picked up this book, I thought, oh cool, a history lesson mixed in with fiction. Well, DuBois didn't really go into the history part as much as he writes about what if the Russians did bomb us and we bombed the Russians, and how would our lives be? That part is terrifying ~~ I cannot imagine living in a police state nor can I imagine losing everything and everyone in a nuclear blast. And DuBois plays well with your emotions and fears as he writes about Carl Landry on a mad hunt for the truth.Landry is joined by a British reporter, Sandy who has secrets of her own. And together, they tried to find out what had really happened that fateful day World War III had broken out. And the military is hot on their tail ~~ they didn't want Landry to find out the the truth. It makes for a good reading.Just because I didn't think it was suspenseful enough for me (No one can be like Patterson or some of those other writers), it is still a good book to pick up. In fact, I am planning to pass this onto my friends and family and see what they think of it. I am sure my parents would enjoy it better as they had lived through the Kennedy times ~~ and still remember those drills in case of a nuclear attack.If you're looking for a fiction that has plenty of action and dialogue, then this is it.

Within its pages, it's 1972, and the United States is still convalescing from a military invasion of Cuba ten years earlier that had resulted in several of America's cities being nuked to oblivion by Soviet warheads, including Washington, DC, and the First Family of Camelot. In retaliation, SAC had bombed the USSR back into the nuclear Dark Ages, an act for which the US is regarded almost as a pariah state. It's only apparent friend is Great Britain, which continues to send food and aid to America's struggling populace, otherwise governed by a weak civilian administration dominated by the military and a shadowy, retired Air Force general. The protagonist of this fairy tale is Carl Landry, an ex-Army sergeant now working as a reporter for Boston's major newspaper. While covering the murder of an aged vet of the Kennedy era, Landry stumbles onto the trail of yet another guv'mint conspiracy, this one with a decidedly British accent.This potboiler hardly simmers through its first half. It's only when Carl and his English gal pal, Sandy, a reporter for the London Times, are chased through the ostensibly uninhabited city of New York by military thugs that the plot heats up beyond lukewarm. As a matter of fact, the love affair between Carl and Sandy suffers from the same lack of heat. I've seen more passion between two snails. To be fair, some amount of frigid water is thrown on Carl's ardor as he begins to suspect that Sandy is not quite what she purports to be. (A secret agent for the Queen Mum, perhaps. Her mission, to find good Indian take-out.)The biggest problem with this \"thriller\" is that the Landry character is painted in such wishy-washy tints. The reader has no idea even what he looks like, much less develop any sympathy for his predicament or root him on to final triumph. He doesn't have an obnoxious drinking buddy, favorite parakeet, nasty chewing tobacco habit, or weakness for cold spaghetti - anything that would flesh out his persona. In any case, as the true nature of the conspiracy is revealed and our marginal hero saves the day, it was hard not to stifle a yawn, or two. Perhaps my drowsiness was a function of the intrigue's level of evil - it wasn't as horrific as usual in most fiction, but just real-life banal. (I mean, the Florida Ballot Chad Machination was more Machiavellian than this.)I grant this novel three stars, not because it's that good, but because the author was well-intentioned and gave a good effort. Towards the end, however, I hastened to finish the book only because I wanted to get on to the next one on my shelf, which I trust will be much better.",

The characters, while adequate, were never developed to the point of being memorable. The dialogue, while not entirely detracting from the book, also didn't give the reader anything worth remembering. Finally, the narrative itself suffered from that most dreaded of maladies: the tidy ending. For instance, the &quot;Resurrection Day&quot; of the story got a great deal of buildup, but then was barely mentioned at the end. I had imagined a lot of possibilities for that aspect of the story. Instead, it got just a few sentences in the last chapter. Other facets of the story suffered a similar fate. A more thorough development of the narrative would have resulted in a more memorable book.Some of the hype would have one believe that Resurrection Day is as good as Fatherland by Robert Harris. I'd actually put it on a level with Harris' Archangel. Both are stories that have great premises, but are not developed to a level that sufficiently explores those premises. As with Archangel, Resurrection Day is not a bad book. However, the promise does not equal the actual product.

Some might say that its the ability of some part of the story to remain with you long after you have finished reading it. In this respect, &quot;Ressurection Day&quot; deserves to be classified as a classic of Alternate History and a great story to boot.From the beginning, Dubois chooses his fork in time carefully. An all too near to reality scenario where the Cuban Crisis ends in World War III is just the kind of twist to lend this alternate world a heafty dose of credibility. Focusing on JFK has Dubois sending his readers directly into what I would term the &quot;Oliver Stone realm of nostalgia&quot; - the world as it might have been had this or other event not hapenned.From these basic ingredients, Dubois weaves an intricate tapestry of memories and tragedies, hopes and fears. This is a world full of regret and a palpable sense of sadness, looking back in anger at the shattered American dream. And in it comes Ressurection's main character, Carl Landry, ostensibly trying to solve a murder, but actually hoping to achieve much much more.Landry's journey through a devastated America is a tour de force of sketches into the avarage person's life after such a cataclysmic event. There are no big heroes to fill the canvas, just a collection of disparate people, nut unlike you and me, trying to make the best out of a horrible situation. The people and the places, the hopes and fears are what you would expect to find in your own neighborhodd, a fact which makes the horros of the war resonate with an uncanny attenuation.

                "review/text": "&quot;Chiefs&quot; is the story of three police chiefs in a small Georgia town: one was the town's very first Chief of Police in the 1920's, the second in the 1940's, and the third in the 1960's. The common thread among the three is a series of disappearances of teenage boys who were traveling through the vicinity of the town when they disappeared.The book isn't really a mystery, since the reader knows the solution to the crime fairly early in the book. What sets the book apart is the well-drawn characters and the unerring and evocative portrayal of the evolution of a small Georgia town from the 1920's up to the middle of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's.Woods has perfect pitch when it comes to dialogue. Every conversation, every confrontation, every characterization rings vividly true. Politics, on a local, state, and national level, is a sub-theme of the book, and the author has obviously done his homework on those topics as well. But the book's most noticeable strength is in its ability to transport the reader almost physically into a sultry Georgia town. Even if you read this during a winter in North Dakota, you'll feel the heat, the tension, the passion, and the fears of a sleepy Georgia town during the mid-20th century for as long as you're reading &quot;Chiefs&quot;.",

Usually, I'd walk on by a book about small town Georgia cops, never imagining it could be this enthralling. The author is masterful at drawing the reader into this little world; I found myself talking out loud to the characters. He doesn't rely on the graphic gore and language of the typical modern shock thriller, hence making the terror more real. What makes the southern authors so good!?

Woods does a great job creating such a diverse group of people all the while keeping them realistic and life-like. He paints a very accurate picture of what the south was like in the early 1900's and the 1950's. Since he created such life-like and believable people, I found myself either hating or loving the characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading. The three Chiefs that are the focal point are all very different, and they all have amazing qualities that make them come alive. Aside from holding the same position at one time or another, they also were committed to solving one of the worst series of crimes the south had ever seen.",

Woods' characters are well defined and complex. There are many good moral people who live in Delano, but there are also the corrupt and perverse, those who have many secrets to hide. The story of the town's growth, as well as that of its inhabitants, over the years is absolutely fascinating, as are the details and intrigues of Georgia's state politics. And the history of the tense race relations during the entire period recalls a time of gross injustice that most of us would like to forget.This is one of the best mysteries I have read in a long, long time, and, to my mind, Stuart Woods' best novel.JANA",

Woods is one of the masters at pacing and it is obviously a skill he possessed early in his career. If you are a fan of his more recent books like THE RUN or DEAD IN THE WATER, you will surely not be disappointed by this one.A serial killer exists virtually unsuspected over the span of three generations of police chiefs in the small farming community of Delano, Georgia. CHIEFS is divided into three separate books, one for each police chief, but the divisions are more complex than merely who is running the department. Delano, the town itself, experiences its own changes in each phase of the story. We see the town flourish in times of economic prosperity, and then struggle as its farming inhabitants grapple with the blight of the boll weevil which destroys their cotton fields. There is the ever-present race clashes, the black and the white fighting for their dignity and place in the rural desegregated South. And Delano's proudest son aspires to establish himself as a viable candidate for the Governor's seat in Georgia.All this provides an intricately textured backdrop in front of which the killer is defying both time and the law. Each new chief of police stumbles across clues left behind by his predecessor, but will the third one figure it out? The killings and the killer's ability to go undetected so long are certainly the focus of the narrative, but the reader becomes just as fascinated by the political, industrial, and cultural development of Delano as well.Once you get into it, you can't help but get hooked. You can read CHIEFS in a weekend's time, because you won't want to put it down.",

This one was a bit slower.It reminded me of a Ken Follett book in that it spans over the course of many years, decades even, intermingling a central location and all the characters who populated that location over the years.I thought the dialogue was a bit on the dry side. Everyone had their own voice and I got the feeling from the style Woods used that people were indeed southern, but there wasn't that much personality to the characters. In other words, I didn't get that much feeling of emotion from their words as I do other books.The book is only about 427 pages long but it seemed like it was alot longer than that.I liked the theme overall..I found the premise of the story very interesting. But the pacing and the lack of focus or time spent on the 'main event' of the book (the common theme that drives the whole story and its characters through the years) kind of killed it for me.",

The story centers on a succession of disappearances of teenage boys and how each Chief attempts to solve the crime and uncover the identity of this baffling killer. It is utterly masterful how Woods seamlessly weaves the individual personalities of his three main characters from different eras into the unraveling of the arcane felony.What is amazinlgy refreshing about Chiefs is its total and complete lack of political correctness. The dialogue is gritty and raw. The politicians are players, corrupt, yet with their own morality. There are no 'pretty' words for African-Americans. Yet, there is no offense here. The words ring with the truth of the tension between the races and the echo's of the early civil rights movement.Woods' has filled his novel with tense moments, an uncommon plodding wittiness, history, culture and best of all a great story that keeps you flicking pages so quickly a bookmark isn't even need...you can't put it down!",

                "review/text": "In their first foray into the realm of fiction, Gene Hackman and Daniel Lenihan created &quot;Wake of the Perdido Star&quot;, a novel that I believed to be one of the best seafaring novels of recent memory. It made me very eager for future efforts from this tandem. While it has been several years, the wait was well worth it. Their sophomore effort, &quot;Justice for None&quot;, is a dramatic departure from their first work, but is a very enjoyable read.I was frankly quite surprised that Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan would release a novel that is of an entirely different subject and historical era from their first one. It is something that, I believe, most authors have not pulled off well, and in doing so, have alienated much of their fan base. However, Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan proved to be the exception to this pattern.&quot;Justice for None&quot; is set in the small Illinois town of Vermilion on the eve of the Great Depression. The story involves Boyd Calvin, a struggling World War I veteran who gets caught up in the murder of his estranged wife, which leads to a pair of runs from justice before a climactic trial to prove his innocence.The Boyd Calvin character is developed very well, and proves to be an interesting focal point for this story. The authors created someone who elicits in the reader an internal conflict. On the one hand, he is a sympathetic character as he struggles with his dark history in the war, the reconciliation with his wife, and his fight against a justice system in which the odds are wholly against him. On the other, he is almost repulsive, as he consistently resists authority and pushes away those who are trying their hardest to help him. This character development works very well, and is somewhat rare to find in these types of stories. It holds your interest and keeps you locked into the plot.The plot itself is also intriguing, though it is perhaps more of a part of a broader view of this pre-Depression, Midwest society. It seems almost underdeveloped in some places, and was less of a driver in advancing the story. Rather, it supplemented the character elements and external events, such as the impending stock market crash, race relations, and small town life. While this would seemingly be a liability, Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan made it work. The prose is descriptive yet sparse, which paints a very vivid picture, keeps the reader interested, and also serves to drive the plot at a rapid pace.I also give credit to Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan for the story development. Novels like this usually have a pretty standard ending that the reader knows at the outset. So, there is usually a &quot;surprise&quot; ending, which sometimes works but more often is picked up by the attentive reader well in advance. In &quot;Justice for None&quot;, the authors somehow developed a storyline that was unexpected in terms of how the climactic moment would unfold. Then on top of that, they advanced the story to a wholly satisfying conclusion that had an element of surprise that was also not anticipated. What made the ending so good is that while it was a surprise, it was also rather subdued, which actually served to emphasize the impact even more.So often in reviews - my own included - there is the tendency to rate something in comparison to the authors' previous work. I tried very diligently to avoid doing so here, because of the stark difference between &quot;Justice for None&quot; and &quot;Wake of the Perdido Star&quot;. If I were to rate this based on a comparison, I probably would rate this as 4 stars. However, taken as a stand-alone novel - which is more fair and representative of the work - it does merit a rating of a full 5 stars.Once again, the work of Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan has apppealed to me as a reader, and I am once again looking forward to their next work. Hopefully, it will not be as long a wait, but I am eager to find out what they come up with next.",

Joanna Rand, a successful business owner, is plagued by crippling phobias that prevent her from leading a normal life. Alex Hunter crosses paths with her during his visit to Japan and finds her situation intruiging. Since he is a detective, he recalls her as a missing person he had been looking for many years earlier.

At one point I almost got hypnotized myself while reading a scene where the character is hypnotized. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the book took a political twist at the end.

Alex becomes determined to help awaken Joanna to the fact that she is not who she thinks she is, and that her life, her memories, and her mind had been created for her.The Key to Midnight is definately a different type of Koontz novel. He usually specializes in horror and suspense. That is why I was very unsure about reading this book. However, as soon as I began, I knew that it would turn out to be one of the best Koontz books that I ever read. The book is an extremely well written and action packed chase novel. The story is paced extremely well because you learn about Joanna's past and why her life was messed with, slowly over the course of the story. You are also kept on the edge of your seat, because there are many different people who do not want Joanna to discover the truth. This book really emphasizes the phrase &quot;trust no one&quot; because anybody could be in on it. Koontz also does a wonderful job of illustrating the different countries that the story takes place in.Overall, The Key to Midnight is one of Koontz's best books. It is an action packed chase novel filled with paranoia, conspiracies, and many great characters.",

The probem I found with the book was that it developed too slowly. We have the same unanswered questions on page 360 as we had in the beginning. It's not until the book has as few as 50 pages left does it really get going. Descriptions of mundane activities is fine. It ads color and depth to the charactors but I thought it was excessive here. They got out of the cab, went to the museaum, checked into a hotel, made a phone call, blah blah blah.

But then why does she have creepy nightmares every night about a guy with metal fingers and a hypodermic needle? And why is Kyoto all of a sudden the site of the world burglars, sneaks, and thugs convention, all of whom are practicing on Alex?We learn two things about the senator very quickly: (a) while serving in Viet Nam he was held prisoner by the Reds and then miraculously escaped, and (b) Alex doesn't like him. This will start off some trains of thought if you are like me, and the words &quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot; may even come to mind. I should point out, though, that Koontz (as he points out in an afterword) has extensively rewritten this book for the post-Soviet era, so it's not going to be quite that simple. If &quot;House of Thunder&quot; is an example of what his old Cold War pseudonymous novels were like before he rewrote them, it's probably good he did.On the con side, the writing tends to be a big clunky and non-atmospheric, and some of the action sequences read like they are verbal descriptions of what he was hoping the movie would be like, which is not the same as good writing even if it would be a good movie. Also, some of the plot devices are implausible, while the motives of some of the characters are hard to explain: in particular there are several people who have every chance to just kill off Alex before he causes any trouble, and I don't know why they don't. And there is some &quot;talking villain&quot; stuff.Back on the pro side, there are enough plot twists to keep you somewhat fooled until pretty late in the game. The love story is a lot like 15 other Koontz love stories, but it has its sweet side. And he writes about Kyoto as if he knew the place, at least from the viewpoint of someone like me who doesn't.When all is said and done, despite its flaws, and despite the fact that I hate Koontz's politics as much as he hates mine, I have to give it three stars, which is not a bad rating coming from me. Actually it's a better 3-star volume than Darkfall. I won't reread it, and I'm glad I didn't pay money for it, but I don't feel as if reading it was an unenjoyable waste.",

In order to make a living, he wrote under a variety of names that was not his own. Koontz's most successful pseudonym was \"Leigh Nichols\" -- under this name, he wrote five bestselling romantic suspense novels. THE KEY TO MIDNIGHT is the first of these books, and was re-released in the 1990s under Koontz' own name.THE KEY TO MIDNIGHT is a highly enjoyable romantic thriller. It mainly takes place in Japan, and Koontz does a great job of describing Japanese culture, which he obviously has a lot of respect for. The two main characters are likable and complex, and the plot is fast-paced and interesting.This is not a horror novel at all, although there are a few graphic violent and sexual scenes. Still, there is very little in this book that is truly gross or disturbing.THE KEY TO MIDNIGHT isn't a masterpiece, but it's a fine entertainment by one the best genre writers working today. This book is easy to read and is a nice way to spend an afternoon. If you're looking for classic Koontz, though, my advice is to try one of his later novels, such as WATCHERS, LIGHTNING, INTENSITY or ODD THOMAS.",

As Mr. Koontz explains at the end of the book, he spent quite a lot of time editing this book prior to re-releasing it under his name.This book was definitely Koontz at his best. Though not your typical Dean Koontz plot, he did a wonderful job crossing in the the Spy Novel Genre. I read this book in one day on the beach. I found it to be wonderfully written, and I really liked the characters. I was certainly surprised to find out who was and wan not one of the bad guys. Boy did it fool me. Some of the characters I expected to be corrupt wern't and some that I expected not to be were.The plot unfolds in Japan, and ends in Switzerland. Mr. Koontz does a great job of describing these locations without getting lengthy and boring yet making them colorful.If you like Dean Koontz, don't leave this book off of your must read list.I have read many of Mr. Koontz's novels and I rank this as one of his best.",

If you ever wanted to know what it would be like to be chased and hunted down like a wounded animal then this is the book you should read. In my opinion it is considerably better than John Buchan's thriller The 39 Steps.The nameless hero 'Rogue Male' is stripped of all identity and forced to flee from the clutches of Hitler's henchmen.He must leave the civilised world behind if he is to survive. His only ally being his finely-tuned subconscious,primitive instincts.This book is definitely one of the classics - one which I have re-read at least 6 times and one which I look forward to reading again in the future.Geoffrey Household's story is so believable that often you are left wondering - did this really happen?The story is extremely well plotted and, if you are reading this book for the first time,you just can't tell what is going to happen next or how the hero will escape from countless near death experiences...Some people may find the story a little slow by modern high-octane hollywood standards. For example, the hero is a reserved 'English Gentlemen' and the death count is minimal (but hence much more realistic). Others on the other hand think the 'old fashioned' style is one of the book's strengths.Basically, if you want something faster paced then try John Buchan or the modern SAS hero Andy McNab. But if you want the daddy of thrillers and one of the most absorbing and intensely rewarding reading experiences of your life then read this near-perfect thriller!Now!",

The technical side of all this is pretty fun and suspenseful stuff, the book's weakness lies in the character of the hero, whose motivations for both stalking the dictator and refusing to appeal to his friends and government are a little tough to understand for the modern reader. Part of this remedied in a nice twist near the end where we learn the real reason why he first trained his sights on the dictator. However, we are forced to lean on somewhat dated notions of loyalty, honor, disgrace, and so forth in order to accept his playing the lone wolf in trying to escape retribution.

It's the 39 Steps, it's Scouting for Boys, and you have to meet it on that level. While Dornford Yates is prissy, Household is visceral.

                "review/text": "Geoffrey Household's Rogue Male is a classic thriller. Household was a British writer, born 1900, who spent some time in the US \"just in time for the Depression\". He began writing in the US, then returned to England. This is his second novel, published in 1939. He spent the War as an Intelligence Officer in Rumania, then returned to a fairly successful career writing. Rogue Male remains his most famous novel, though Arabesque (made into a movie with Gregory Peck, as I recall) is also well known.Rogue Male opens with the never named first person protagonist aiming a rifle with a telescopic sight from 550 yards at a certain Head of State. It's never made precisely clear who that is -- a country on one side or the other of Poland, which leaves two pretty evil candidates as of the late 30s. It's pretty likely that Hitler is the real target, but the book takes care never to reveal which of Hitler or Stalin was the target -- on purpose, I think.The protagonist claims he had no intention of shooting -- he was just \"stalking the most dangerous game\" for the fun of it, to see if he could be successful. This doesn't play well with the local secret police, who torture him and leave him for dead. But he rather incredibly escapes, and makes his way down a river, soon pursued by his enemies. He stows away on a boat for England, but soon is again pursued. When he is forced to kill one of his pursuers, he becomes wanted for murder by the British police. He flees to the country, planning to literally hole up for the duration. But even his careful plans aren't quite enough -- some bad luck leads to the British police getting a lead, and though he can elude them, the bad guys are able to track him down.It's pretty good stuff. Exciting, not too ridiculously implausible, and at least somewhat interested in exploring the moral basis of the protagonist's decisions. (Though there is plenty of guff, too, in particular lots of stuff about the wonderful ineffable qualities of the English Upper Class.) (Some of the book is the protagonist's own coming to terms with his real motives and intentions.) It helps of course that the protagonist's target is a real-life maximally evil sort -- even if we continue to disapprove of his assassination attempt, it's hard not to sympathize at some level. The book is also quite dryly funny on occasion. The ending is interesting in retrospect. The protagonist, having again escaped, decides his only recourse is to finish the assassination job. And there the book ends. But it was published in 1939. Then it was a very \"open\" ending. Now -- any time since 1945 really -- the ending has closed somewhat -- we can only conclude that the protagonist failed in his attempt and was presumable summarily executed. (Though I understand there was eventually a sequel.)",

However, there is one distinguishing feature that separates Rogue Male from the dozens of thrillers filling the aisles of bookstores and that is the quality of writing. None of the above can measure up to RM in terms of language and syntax. The difference in quality is palpable. Basic descriptions and plot devices are figurative. Sandra Stotsky writes about this in her book, Losing Our Language and I am starting to agree with her. Books fifty years ago were better written on average than books today. Books written 100 years ago are an even better deal if one likes quality. Very few present day writers of even serious fiction (I am excluding Cormac McCarthy, J.M. Coetzee and Toni Morrison,) can stand comparison. I am not sure whether many writers write down to their audiences or whether this is what our education system now produces.

It is written in the form of a journal or confession by an Englishman gentleman sportsman who hunted the most dangerous game. The writer was caught, tortured, then thrown off a cliff to make his death look like an accident. But he survived and escaped from a central European country. However, the agents of this country were put on his trail in England.The unnamed hero withdraws funds from his account, then disappears into the country to hide in solitude. But in his escape an enemy agent dies, and the English police are on his trail too. The foreign agents can now use police reports to locate this fugitive. The story tells how he escapes, how he hides, and what happens after his is tracked down by a secret agent. The good guy escapes, assumes the identity of this secret agent, and lays a false trail out of the country.This story records the thoughts of the hero. Dialogue is sparse. Parts of this story explain the operations of a secret agent. The author served as an Intelligence Officer in Rumania and the Middle East during WW II. His \"Rogue Justice\" is the sequel to this book. If you can accept the premise that his captors wouldn't finish him off in the beginning, the rest of the story follow. It reminds me of \"The Great Impersonation\" by E. Phillips Oppenheim, and a John Buchan story (hunted in the mountains).",

                "review/text": "Like the dictator he attempts to assassinate, the protagonist of \"Rogue Male\" remains unnamed throughout the novel. For most of the story, all we learn of our narrator-hero, beyond his physical appearance, is that he is upper-middle class, an experienced hunter, and perhaps famous. Beaten, left for dead, and chased down like an animal, his character is a combination of raw survival instinct and cool rationality, without extraneous motivations, attachments, or desires. It is only during the novel's final third or so -- which I read, engrossed, between 1:30 and 3:00 am one morning -- that our hero confronts his motivations, his past, his beliefs, his politics -- and his enemy. Another reviewer wrote that the book's conclusion relies on \"somewhat dated notions of loyalty, honor, disgrace, and so forth\", but this is not the case: the \"dated notions\" he refers to are approached reluctantly, from a position of cynicism and disillusionment. To reveal any more would spoil the story, but the discussion of motivation is more complex and fascinating than the other reviewer's comments make out.The storytelling is pacey and suspenseful, even though the setting is not a tropical rainforest but the lush English countryside, and the protagonist is a tweed-wearing huntsman rather than a John Rambo-style commando. The book is realistic, at least in tone, and the narrator is entertainingly resourceful. Unlike some other survival stories, \"Rogue Male\" leaves you feeling grateful for civilization.This is an example of literary genre fiction that is accessible, entertaining, and substantial. It's the kind of book you want to reread and recommend to others. I certainly will be doing both, and I'm glad to have bought it.",

And suddenly higher mathematics was awash in spells, summonings, and alternate dimensions where forces lived that would like nothing better than to munch on your brain. Thanks to the Turing-Lovecraft theorem magic happens, almost inevitably for the worst.The British Secret Service (MI-6, the anti-spell branch) has a unique way of dealing with theoreticians who trip over the right formulae - they hire them into The Laundry and retire them to meaningless desk jobs. Bob Howard, however, is a little to itchy for the passive life. After a lot of trying he manages to get into field work. Now, as a relief from an irritating boss who counts paperclips and takes regular attendance, Bob gets to deal with dark forces and demonic possession.There are two tales in this book. The first is The Atrocity Archives, which was Charles Stross's initial effort. Told as one long computer geek in-joke, the story introduces us to Bob and follows him through his first set of assignments and nervous breakdowns, while a series of ever more peculiar administrators keep telling him what a good job he's doing.And he is doing a good job. Spotting mathematicians who have crossed the line, saving workshop attendees from being munched, and getting thrown out of the States for poking too far into the badness on what should have been a routine extraction. But even good agents have bad days and our wisecracking hero finds himself going through a portal to rescue a very attractive scientist from a very dead earth.The second story Concrete Jungle mixes interdepartmental politics, electronic basilisks, and fears about the end of the world in a story of one too many cows.Intrigued? If you are comfortable with computers, or at least have a handle on geek speak and enjoy twisted, funny writers whose imaginations have run wild, this is something you will want to read. Despite a large serving of sarcasm and irony, Stross also manages to deliver a genuinely interesting plot with as much action as there is esoteric muttering. By all means check this out.

From there things just get worse as he is sucked into a conspiracy to open a portal to an alternate universe to let in one of the elder gods or into an interdepartmental conspiracy to eliminate his department.

Another future world is being explored in the novel Singularity Sky and sundry short stories/future novels - also post-Singularity, and imbued with a pervading humour even through some quite horrifying passages.The Atrocity Archives is best read with this in mind: despite looking a bit like horror, this is really hard science fiction with a lot of humour and a very weird Lovecraftian twist regarding the nature of the world. It's geeky but cool, a clever take on the spy thriller, and the only connection it has with &quot;A Colder War&quot; is that it's Lovecraft-inspired spy fiction by the same author.

Everyone else in the book is completely forgettable or cliched (e.g. the \"mad scientist\" roomates Pinky and Brains).The plot is uneven, slow in the first half and shifting into \"action\" mode in the second half. The mixture of a modern office atmosphere and Lovecraft reminided me of Spencer's Resume with Monsters, which IMHO held together much better.I got introduced to Stross by his short story \"A Colder War\" which exists in the same Lovecraft meets the military-industrial-complex universe. The short story was a lot more streamlined and did not have the tedious amount of exposition about magic cum mathematics as the Atrocity Archives.

Unfortunately, the Atrocity Archives is not a very good book.This novel came highly recommended to me. I am a great fan of Lovecraft, science fiction, spy fiction, and have worked in a government agency long enough to appreciate the lunacy of such places. When somebody told me the premise of the Atrocity Archives and Charles Stross's \"Laundry\" universe, I thought it was the most brilliant idea in the world.The premise behind the story is this. There is an unseen world of occult, alien horror beneath the veneer of our mundane universe, and one gateway to that unseen world is computers and technology. To guard against this terrifying other-world, shadowy government agencies have sprung up. The Laundry is one such clandestine government agency. Its agents are an odd blend of tech geeks andIf you are into this kind of thing, this is a fantastic premise. But a premise is not a story. It only lays out the setting for a story. In science fiction like this, it promises a universe of opportunities for great stories. Sadly, despite the great premise, the Atrocity Archives is not a very interesting story. More importantly, the story was poorly told.Despite Mr. Stross's fertile imagination, he is just not a very good storyteller. The story is told through a first person perspective, narrated by a Laundry agent named Bob. Bob seems like an obnoxious guy. He tells the story with a bunch of asides, obscure geek references, and digressions. He seems like the sort of guy who thinks he is quite clever and witty, but is not really. He seems like the sort of guy who you might run into at a party, and you would want to get away from because he loves to drop names and make himself seem smart. He would tell stories where he never seems to get to the point because he is too busy dazzling you along the way with how much he knows. And he whines...he always seem to be vaguely contemptuous of everybody and dissatisfied with the people around him. Bob is almost like a sociopath, he never displays any affection for any of the characters we come across in the book, or care about what's going on with them beyond how it relates to Bob. To Bob, everyone else seems to be an annoyance.On top of it all, Bob's narration is delivered in a weird Micky Spilane over-the-top pulp style that's just too much.So it goes with Bob's story, which is the subject of the book. Bob is supposed to be a tech geek and a bit of a bureaucratic drone, but he spends pages making references to geeky things like \"The theorem is a hack on discrete number theory that simultaneously disproves the Church-Turing hypothesis (wave if you understood that) and worse, permits NP-complete problems to be converted into P-complete ones. This has several consequences, starting with screwing over most cryptography algorithms - translation: all your bank account are belong to us - and ending with the ability to computationally generate a Dho-Nha geometry curve in real time.\" Heavy exposition like this can go on for paragraphs and seem to litter every other page. The problem with exposition is that it is not story - things do not happen in expositions. So when a novel is so exposition heavy, it is not much fun to read.I think these flaws could have together formed an asset for the novel had there been a detectable sense of humour behind it - if I could see Mr. Stross winking behind Bob's obnoxious narration. But I don't. Mr. Stross's attempt at humour mostly comes from flat cardboard characters meant to represent various office drone stereotypes that we should laugh at - like Bob's ineffectual but nitpicky boss, or some jockish dullard who sits with Bob at an arcane tech seminar but summoning entities from beyond with electronic circuits. These jokes aren't funny because they've done before and done better. These 1-dimensional figures of fun are dropped into the story at poorly timed intervals. We never get treated to any situations where would could have a bit of a laugh at Bob, or when Bob is portrayed with any kind of charm.I really wanted to like the Atrocity Archives, so much that when I bought the book I bought the next novel in the series with it. Unfortunately, Mr. Stross is just not a very good storyteller. Bad writing like this just wears me down.",

Yes, Virginia, reading Stross makes you feel smarter, as others have observed....This is Must Read stuff for Lovecraft fans, but if you like the work of Alan Moore, Warren Ellis, or Grant Morrison's THE INVISIBLES, then this is more or less guaranteed to flip your wig.",

The plot centersaround a guy who is basicly a system administrator who getsdrafted into the larger work of technology suppression andThe Fight Against Evil.

Stross places his characters in a world where magic is real but actually the result of complex mathematics/logical systems that can open portals to scary, alternative dimensions. This is a relatively old idea, to my knowledge used first by Pratt and de Camp in the 1950s. He has used this idea to adapt a Lovecraftian world and combines his plotting with satire of bureaucratic/corporate life. The third crucial element in constructing this story is a adaptation of Cold War thrillers, specifically the work of Len Deighton. Stross does a nice job of combining these elements and the plotting is imaginative with reasonably effective satire. Entertaining reading though perhaps too much of an in joke.",

It has all the ingredients of a top class thriller.The only drawback that I have noticed was the computer program that Jeannie Ferrami wrote to retrieve matches from databases. That seems a bit far fetched since the program seems to run on any platform, search any database of any type.

It addresses the question of nature vs. nurture, and Follett obviously believes that no matter what's in your genes, it's important as to what kind of environment you are raised in.Jeannie Ferrami, the heroine, is a strong, determined character, and I liked her persistence in proving not only that her scientific studies are correct, but that the conspiracy she has uncovered needs to be addressed! I wish sometimes other reviewers wouldn't...mention some of the plot's \"surprises,\" such as the number of clones, but even though in reading the reviews, you get advance information, don't let that spoil the finesse in which Follette weaves his tale.I liked Steve Logan, too. He comes across as a sincere, honest type of guy, who wants to be a good lawyer and is caught in the unbelievable maze of discovering he is a clone.The novel opens briskly with one of the evil clones rape of Jeanne's best friend, and we get involved with the confusion when Steve enters Jeannie's life.The villains are all particularly vile, but Berrington Jones is the worst.

Being Republicans they wanted to perfect the white American race. I think the idea was to create a WASP master-race and abolish welfare, possibly replacing it with slavery. They were even against gun control.Fast-forward twenty years. Here comes a six-foot young woman with big hair - a world-class tennis player as well as brilliant scientist, expert in psychology, genetics, computer science, you name it. Wow, this has to be Jolie McGillis. Her taste in underwear is lovingly described. Surprisingly she isn't a clone but she takes up with one, who happens to be nicely brought up. The rest are degenerate sadists, rapists and murderers. I told you they were WASPs.Now our girl finds out about the other clones, partly through being such a brilliant scientist but mostly by nearly getting laid by them. Naturally the evil GOP-men can't let any of this get out, especially as the aforesaid politician is about to run for the White House and has plans to rename Washington Berchtesgaden-on-the-Potomac. (I exaggerate - a little.) So we have toing and froing and cliff-hanging, 500 pages of it, until at last the bad guys get their comeuppance and the heroine fades into the sunset with her favorite clone.This is not exactly trash. Follett is a fluent writer and capable of better than that. He makes the pages turn as well as anyone and one or two of his characters are fairly memorable. (Aside: some reviewers seem to think he's American. He's British and a buddy of Tony Blair, which makes him a buddy-at-one-remove of ... ahem.) I suppose he intends us to take this story somewhat seriously, but I can't do it. I've seen more plausible scenarios on the back of cereal packets.

I had read Ken Follet's excellent &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; a few years ago and decided to try another of his books. This book did not even approach the level of the first Follet novel I read. Unlike &quot;Pillars&quot;, in &quot;The Third Twin&quot; Follet does not appear to have done any research on his subject matter. In one section he has a character reminiscing about his father who was a SECOND LIEUTENANT in the US NAVY. The US Navy has never had second lieutenants; junior officers of that pay grade are called Ensigns. But this is only the beginning of technical errors that destroy an otherwise compelling story line. One of the main weapons of the protagonist is a computer program that she wrote to compare elements in database to develop genetic comparisons. Unfortunately, the way the thing is supposed to work is closer to something that Gandalf or Harry Potter would whip up rather than something out of computer science class. The poorly researched and unbelievable stuff goes on and worsens throughout the book. More examples - people out on bail without a security clearance wandering the halls of the Pentagon and putting magic floppy disks into the Pentagon computers - you guessed it - so they could search the databases on those computers. All in all, I was very, very glad when the book drew to its predictable close.Follet is a good writer, but he really needs to research his subjects better before writing a book.",

Giving this book even a one star rating is more than it deserves for the following reasons:1) the very few scientific facts appearing in this book that I DID know prior to reading it were totally wrong in the book - you get a WHOLE chromosome from each parent, not 2 different strands that combine into 2 chromosomes with a strand of each parent in each - this is scientifically impossible from what I've learned in 9th or 10th grade level biology!2) The book was so full of stereotypes you don't have to read more than a few pages to fill in the rest with guesswork. It seems Ken Follet has left wing opinions, so for him right wing = evil. Or the stereotypic jail description..3) The EXTREME chauvinistic attitude of the book - in order for a woman to be strong, she has to be masculine - both physically and though her personality and attitude to life, while a &quot;feminine&quot; woman is portrayed as weak... Please compare Mish or Jeannie to Jeannie's friend Lisa or her sister Patty... The former two are more 'manly' and aggressive , and the later are feminine and soft. The first 2 don't have an harmonious family and are not the type to be raped, while the other 2 are... The former 2 get things accomplished and are exected to do the hard job and decisions, while the later 2 are more dependent on others to do the hard work and decide the tough decisions for them.4) Too many twists and turns of the plot, especially towards the end!5) Jeannie's academics are ALL MIXED UP - she did a master's degree in computers, and now is wsorking in the psychology department on genetics research (which is a field in biology?) Why would an assistant in the psychology department have a nurse's or doctor's skill of drawing blood?6) I've saved the 'best' for last. As a woman reading what I persume is a thriller, I RESENT having to read all about what different underwear the women wore or how they're built. Let's take Jeanie for example. Whoever suffered through this book probably knows that she's tall and that she has an athletic body build with long, flowing dark curly hair, smooth back, smooth and flat tummy, long muscly legs, and small breasts with dark nipples which she thinks are too small, but all the men she'd been with like them just fine. Oh, and she also likes tp have her nipples sucked, and thinks that going without any underwear is sexy just in case 'her man' comes along and wants a quickie. I hope this pasage does not upset anyone, but my point is that all this info has NOTHING to do with the plot, weak as the later might be. So do Lisa's red lace underwear or large bra size. This is not a porn story, so being able to envision Jeannie naked does not enhance the story. I normally don't mind a little sexual stuff in books I read, but this is simply too much and too specific in this context!",

As British and American forces strike into the soft underbelly of Hitler's Fortress Europa, the new weapons of war come clearly into focus. In North Africa, tank battles unfold in a tapestry of dust and fire unlike any the world has ever seen. In Sicily, the Allies attack their enemy with a barely tested weapon: the paratrooper. As battles rage along the coasts of the Mediterranean, the momentum of the war begins to shift, setting the stage for the Battle of Normandy. The first book in a trilogy about the military conflict that defined thetwentieth century, The Rising Tide is an unprecedented and intimate portrait of those who waged this astonishing global war.

Griffin concocted wonderful war adventures from blending real people and events with fictional characters and circumstances. Jeff Shaara has gone miles beyond Griffin in taking real people, real events, adding just a bit of imagination and turning actual history into great fiction. Truly great fiction.\"The Rising Tide\" is the first of a planned trilogy about WWII. For the first few pages, I wondered where Shaara was going. It was more on the order a well written history text. Then it segued to Rommell in the desert . . . and then it dawned on me.Shaara is bringing us into a part of the lives of Rommel, Eisenhower, Patton, Montgomery, Bradley and ordinary soldiers that we can't touch: the internal happenings of their minds. Shaara's goal is audacious and his success breathtaking.Most of Shaara's words are spent on the leaders, like Rommell and Eisenhower. Good move: Shaara is able to provide the big picture, the sweep and scope of the war. In less competent hands, I doubt that it would work. But Shaara makes it seem real. The frustrations of Rommel, faced with a deteriorating situation in Africa, the jealousy of other German generals, the incompetence of the Italian leadership, the increasingly delusional Hitler and his own declining health. Shaara puts you in Rommel's mind, so to speak, and he does it well.The same holds true for Eisenhower, as yet untested as the leader of a never before attempted coalition. Eisenhower is not sure of his own capabilities, but he has virtually no one to confide his fears in. Shaara makes leadership the lonely place it is.Without spoiling it for the reader, it is difficult to convey Shaara's triumph. To those familiar with WWII history, particularly the North African campaigns, virtually every event in Shaara's book will be known. Shaara wisely balances the big-time players like Eisenhower with some smaller fry, specifically two American soldiers. It's an impressive and very effective technique.For those readers who are not overly familiar with the period, it's a painless and entertaining way to open a window on history.Shaara has done something truly unique here and he's done it superlatively well. WWII history afficiandos and those simply interested in a solid war adventure will find it fascinating. I'm impatiently looking forward to the next two volumes.Jerry",

Those familiar with his other works--such as his Civil War novels, Gods and Generals and The Last Full Measure, his Revolutionary War and Mexican War works--will recognize the technique here. Shaara picks a handful of characters and uses their experiences to create the forward movement of his works.In The Rising Tide, the key characters whose views are used to create the narrative include George Patton, Dwight Eisenhower, Erwin Rommel (\"The Desert Fox\"), Albert Kesselring, and a couple American soldiers, Jack Logan and Jesse Adams. The advantage of this is that you see the role of individuals, from different perspectives in a series of military engagements. This provides a certain richness of texture to the novel. On the other hand, there are limits to this. The reader does not get a bird's eye view of the action. All is through the eyes of specific individuals grounded in very specific circumstances. This works well enough, of course, but things can get left out.The novel begins with Rommel's combat against the English in North Africa and his ability to win against long odds. However, the weight on British and then British and American troops is too much, as his army cannot receive enough gasoline, replacement troops and tanks , and so on to compete effectively. After the allies defeat the German and Italian forces in North Africa, the action of the novel moves to Sicily, where the hard fought campaign is described well. The conclusion of the novel points to the nasty Italian campaign and the early days of organizing the invasion of France.The reader is left looking forward to the next volume in this series. While the structure of Shaara's novel has lost its novelty, it can still be effective as a story telling device.",

I realized part way through that the dialogue attributed to each man is indistinguishable in vocabulary, diction, and tone from each other. There is no sense of Eisenhower's optimism, Patton's fire, Rommel's leadership or Marshall's gravitas. All of them, in the book, speak in contemporay (and I mean currrent contemporary) slang. I realize that general officers sometimes address each other by first name in private, but I don't believe ANYONE ever addressed Marshall as \"George\"...and Marshall addressed Eisenhower as \"Eisenhower\" and never as \"Ike\" as Shaara has him doing.By the way, there is an author's warning about the language in the book. It's limited to everybody saying \"damnned\" a whole damnned lot - from George Marshall (who seldom, if ever, used any sort of profanity) to George Patton (who was famous for his foul tounge, and was a much more creative cusser then using one mild expletive continuously).The research seems to be correct in the large but superficial. The author refers to equpment (armored trucks) that did not exist in the U.S. Army inventory in 1942, and there are numerous small factual errors - for example American tanks are referred to as \"more compact\" then German ones - when in fact the high profile of US armor was a disadvantage compared to German armor.In short, if you know anything about WWII history already, you will not enjoy the book because of the inaccurate characterization of historical figures that you already know and numerous niggling factual errors. If you aren't knowlegeable about WWII history, you will get tired of the cookie-cutter characters and won't care much about the fictional ones.The story of a green U.S. Army facing the veteran German army and losing it's first battle (Kasserine Pass) and then recovering to win victory after victory over the nazis is a great one. It deserves better than this novel. Your time and money would be better spent with history - like Stephen Ambrose, Cornelius Ryan or Charles B. Macdonald to name a few.",

The author fictionalizes the thoughts and conversations of historical figures like Rommel and Eisenhower plus he adds a few fictitious characters to round out the story. It is well done but the characters do not have the depth of the WEB Griffin characters or those of Herman Wouk in his novelsThe Winds of WarandWar and Remembrance. Both Griffin and Wouk use minor characters to tell the story and make much less of an attempt to present the thinking of the historical figures. I think both Wouk and Griffin draw better and deeper characters although I understand some of the impatience readers have with recent Griffin books. The early Griffin series about Army Aviation and about the Marine Corps in World War II are better novels with fully rounded characters. Wouk's characters are the work of a master. Tom Clancy writes less in a historical genre although his novels are written for the same readers.Having said that, this is a good novel with lots of detail that, having read a lot of history about this period, sounds accurate to me. For someone who knows less of the history and wants to learn it, this would be an excellent read. It is a fictional version ofAn Army at Dawn: The War in North Africa, 1942-1943, Volume One of the Liberation Trilogy.",

                "review/text": "This book is a good complement to the recent non-fiction \"An Army at Dawn\" by Atkinson. The latter described the US Army's experience in North Africa during World War 2. Shaara's book is also mostly about the same theatre, though it also ventures into the subsequent Italian campaign. For Shaara's fans, the format of the book will be quite familiar. There is the rendition of fictional dialogue by historical figures; in this case Patton, Eisenhower and Rommel. Plus a smattering of purely fictional, low ranking characters. Here, a tanker and a paratrooper.As usual, Shaara has performed impressive research. So that when a well known historical figure makes some remark, you can be confident that even though it may be fictional, it is consistent with what actually transpired. Plus, the narrative shows many of the difficulties encountered in the field. Something that standard history texts might not sufficiently portray.However it has to be said that the book is like his others in this regard. Barely more than a pure non-fiction historical treatise. The overwhelming focus is the actual events. The fictional characters are little other than cardboard. None are truly memorable. One could reasonably say that the narrative is essentially non-fiction.You disagree? Here is another take. Do you read science fiction? A common and accurate criticism of much science fiction is that the idea (usually technology oriented) is the true hero of the story. Any human characters are often just window dressing, to buttress the idea. If you can recognise that in science fiction, so too with Shaara's books.Still disagree? There have been some memorable novels set in World War 2. \"Winds of War\" by Herman Wouk, and \"From Here to Eternity\" by James Jones, for example. Written in the 1960s, these are now generally considered classic. The characters are far more fully fleshed and thus likelier to remain in your memory long after you have read the books. Yes, you can be a fan of Shaara. But you should still also see that he has never produced anything as comparable.",

The characters are richly drawn, Rommel, Eisenhower, Montgomery, Clark, Patton and a memorable list of others. The bulk of the novel takes place in North Africa as an uncertain and untested American force joins the British in an attempt to drive Rommel and his Panzer divisions from North Africa. Then the action leaps to Sicily where Patton takes center stage and adds to his illustrious reputation. I loved how the action and history propels you through the pages. The characters literally jump off the page at you and you become to know them so well. Interesting in how the story weaves back from the Allied point of view and the German point of view.

This book is not for the fate of heart or those that are offended by the gore and violence that are a staple of Laymon's writing.

Richard is definitely a powerful writer because I am still twisted up after reading that book a few days ago. Yes, it is a long novel, and although there was some drags in the tempo of the story, I definitely could not put the book down. Very good characters, very good plot, nice twists and one hell of a turn of events near the end of the book. Once the last few chapters arrived the story seemed to kick into overdrive, going from telltale suspense to shocking horror, with a lot of genuine scares and a decent amount of gore. The one thing that I noticed about this novel was the way that Laymon didnt over do it in contrast to some other horror stories that I have read.I am still in awe at how attached I became to the characters, possibly because I could relate with what the main character was going through. Tales of belonging, tales of male machismo, young love, and acceptance. Laymon did a wonderful job bringing them all to life with fire-breathing results.Bottom Line: I am impressed enough that I am going on in his collection to see what other treasures await me. So for any of you out there that love carnival horror/suspense, or are interested in trying a Laymon novel, this was an interesting place to start and a great, great book.-CW",

The problem with the vagrants is not only do they panhandle but they occassional molest visitors to Funland. A group of young people seek to rid Boleta Bay of the trolls and begin the past-time of 'trolling' in which they lure a bum out and then beat them up, humiliate them further, and leave the calling card for 'Great Big Billy Goat Gruff'. Predictably, one attack goes to far and a bum is killed.Included in the story is Jeremy 'Duke' Wayne, new 16-year old arrival to the town and he meets up with Cowboy, one of the trollers and is quickly brought into the band of hobo-stalking hooligans. Tanya is the leader of the trollers bent on revenge after some bums had attack and raped her previously. Next comes the stereo-typed police team whom are attracted to each other and the purported sexual tension is thick between them. Now mix in Jeremy's lusting for Tanya and possible romantic tie-in Shiner (Debbie) over whom Jeremy can't decide which one he's more lustful for. Of course, things go wrong for the trollers one night and they end up in the funhouse.Here's where other reviewers are going to dislike me...There's just too much going on here. It seems like Laymon couldn't decide on which story idea to pursue so kind of slops them all together in a ragtag story. The books 500 pages long and really could have been cut and edited down to 300-350 pages because there's so much filler, sub stories, and too many non-essential characters going on. Dropping those 150 pages of stalling text would not have hindered the actual story in any way and would have improved the reading of this book. Plain and simple, there are large parts of this book that should have been cut and Laymon should have focused on one main plotline.The book is good enough to read but it certainly doesn't live up to the splash blurbs on the covers claiming what a fantastic suspense/horror novel this is. I'm willing to try other Laymon books but this was mediocre at best and runs along the lines of many dreadfully boring Koontz books. It had serious potential with the trolling storyline but becomes a mangled mess with unnecessary substories.",

Higgins is a well-oiled, formulaic writer, able to produce simple, direct sentences, basic emotions, and some color, using a relatively standard set of \"high\" elements. In this case, using foggy London, the stormy Irish Sea, forested Germany, and Middle Eastern deserts, he provides some set pieces of almost chivalrous interaction among the caricatured cast: the reformed IRA member, the London mobsters, the head of a shadowy British counterintelligence unit, the crippled computer wonk, the very attractive Oxford assistant, the noble Nazi, the secretive Swiss banker, the out-of-wedlock son, and the elderly one-time secretary to Hitler. Both sides of the battle have polite face-to-face meetings where they swear they will kill each other. What are they waiting for? Characters reveal incredible skills with obscure or unrelated tasks, from playing the piano to speaking multiple languages to working explosives. Sean Dillon could be James Bonds' darker side, or brother abandoned at birth.Moving quickly across time and place, Higgins's prose is as sparse as Hemingway's yet without any of the emotion or power. The \"emotional event\" that drives the protagonist, seems small and insignificant. Higgins is more fascinated with food (lots of bacon and eggs), hotels (the Dorchester), restaurants, booze (make it Bushmills), weapons (everybody loves their Walthers), estates (German, of course) and haunts (pubs, night clubs, swank clubs, the London docks) than with his paper mache characters. Even his layout is thin: 282 pages, large font, extra spacing between lines, blank pages between chapters and sections. This is a quick read because the story is so short. Even the stereotypic plot 'device', the Hitler diary, has no real use in the story. remove it entirely and you lose little of the story.One star for weaving a credible (if poorly researched) story and another for making it easy to digest.

In Bad Company, Mr. Higgins has once again developed such a concept. In the waning days of World War II, the Nazis hold secret talks with the Americans about joining forces against the Soviet Union. Although those talks went nowhere, the U.S. representative was the father of the current U.S. President, Jake Cazalet. And thus you see the risk of grave embarrassment.The book takes a strange turn in two ways. First, Mr. Higgins grafts this interesting concept onto a continuation of the Rashid family saga . . . which doesn't really add anything to the book. In fact, it makes the book work less well. Second, the German protagonist is a confusing mix of a good German who turns into a supporter of post World War II Nazis . . . and a father who wants to dote on a monster.On the side of the angels is the usual devil, Sean Dillon, who routinely annoys and dispatches all adversaries with comic book panache. I personally don't enjoy reading about Mr. Dillon and this book has much too much of him in it.As with other books in this series, all roads lead through Northern Ireland . . . which is fine if you don't mind that sort of thing.As I finished the book, I realized that the interesting premise had turned into a book that could have been written with almost any premise.

                "review/text": "First a little background information about the main players in this tale of cocaine, murder, egos, and Showbiz &quot;wannabes&quot; and &quot;ustawuzes.&quot;For starters there was Roy Radin, a modern day, but old fashioned, vaudeville entrepeneur. Radin got very rich producing vaudeville type productions that traveled a circuit of medium sized midwestern cities and towns as fund raisers for such organizations as police benevolent societies. The sponsoring societies did make money, but Radin usually made more. His shows and audiences were the sort that usually gave more applause and greater laughter to the trained dog act than to well-known entertainer, Joey Bishop.Oh, yes, Radin was also a binge eater and user of cocaine. These little habits often consumed a big part of his income.The second major player in this drama was Karen &quot;Laney&quot; Jacobs, later Laney Greenberger. It is a matter of public record, from her later pre-trial hearings, that Laney was a major cocaine distributor who did business with some very vicious people, and who ended up on trial herself for a very vicious murder.A third player, key to our story, was Robert Evans, a Hollywood movie producer who had produced some very successful movies but who, during the period covered by this book, was somewhat down on his luck.Additional players were various drug traffickers, dealers, gangsters, and hit men, as well as Laney's last husband, Larry Greenberger, who either was a retired businessman or a major player in the drug trade, depending on whose testimony one chooses to believe.It would seem that both Radin and Laney (then Greenberger) wanted to get into the legitimate movie producing business. To facilitate this desire, Laney introduced Radin to Robert Evans who had the rights to produce the movie &quot;Cotton Club,&quot; but who was unable, at that time, to get financing through normal channels. Radin, through use of his own money, and money from other sources, could provide this much needed financial backing.Laney's idea, when she made the introduction, was to form a production company consisting of Evans, Radin, and herself. This is the point where Radin made his very serious error in judgment. He decided to cut Laney out of the deal and to only pay her a $50,000 finder's fee. Laney didn't take kindly to this snub. Being a principal in the procuction company that made this film would have made her &quot;someone&quot; in Hollywood, and potentially could have been very profitable to the tune of millions.She didn't take this sort of thing lightly. One evening, she set up a dinner meeting with Radin to &quot;discuss&quot; their differences. He was last seen alive getting into her limousine. A month later his badly decomposed body was discovered, It had multiple bullet holes in the head.Her last husband was also guilty of using poor judgment, which evidently caused Laney to become angry with him. One day, with Laney upstairs in their large estate home in Florida, He managed to commit suicide in a most unusual manner. With a large caliber gun in his right hand, he somehow shot himself in the left temple with powder marks that indicated that, in addition to this unusual way of shooting himself on the wrong side of the head, he had managed to do it from six to eight feet away. Very long arms? He also managed to hold onto the gun, with his finger still on the trigger, even though the recoil should have caused him to drop it. A most amazing form of suicide.Since Laney was charged with Radin's murder and expedited to California, the investigation of this most unusual suicide was never completed.This all goes to show that, when dealing with a no-nonsense, tough as nails, female drug dealer, one really should try to use some degree of discretion.",

Steve Wick did a wonderful job in developing the story without making it too heavy for the gray cells. He was able to successfully give insights into the lives of both the living and the dead giving ample space for both the protagonist (Roy Radin) and the antagonist (Laney Jacobs) as well as the people around them.After reading the book, I see Laney Jacobs/Laney Greenberger as a woman who used an aura air sophistication and good taste to mask her ruthlessness. She was a woman who wouldn't let anything or anybody stand in the way of achieving her goals and dreams. Laney Jacobs/Laney Greenberger was a person who only thought of herself.The only problem that I had with the book is that the last 2 chapters gave me an impression that the last parts were hastily done. I believe Steve Wick could have given the said sections \"more meat\" instead of making it look like a summary of whatever happened after Laney Jacob's/Laney Greenberger's arrest.",

With all that said, this book is good but not as good as some other Sandford novels I have enjoyed. I am a computer nerd of sorts myself, so I found the books plot (computer hacking/industrial warfare) interesting. The scenes centered around LuEllen's skills at B &amp; E are good too. The story includes some clever elements and plot twists that always make for a fun read.

I like to get drawn into an exciting story about a conflict between one or more &quot;good guys&quot; and one or more &quot;bad guys&quot; - preferably including some gals in the top roles. I love it when the plot includes unexpected twists, and I like it when the background for the story includes authentic information of interest that I wasn't aware of before. Finally, I like it when the top characters are well developed and believable, and I can identify with one of the good guys and boo and hiss the bad guys.&quot;The Fool's Run&quot; passes most of my tests for a good thriller. I found the book quite exciting and I did feel captured by the story - I read the book in only two sittings.And yet, here I am giving it only two stars.After I finished reading &quot;The Fool's Run&quot; I sat back and realized that I didn't particularly like the &quot;good guys&quot;. In fact, it can be argued that this story does not include any &quot;good guys&quot;.The hero, Kidd (who has no first name), is a Vietnam veteran who paints pictures, practices karate, consults tarot cards and is a computer programming wizard. He accepts a job to basically smash a company by infiltrating their computer system and slowly but surely destroy the company's ability to function. Payment? Two million dollars!Our hero recruits several others to help him in this endeavor. LuEllen (who has no last name) is a cocaine-snorting cat burglar. But she's OK, because she only steals from rich people. She and Kidd have a loose relationship because neither of them is capable of committing themselves to a real relationship.The other two team members are Dace, a down-and-out journalist who admits that the only reason he isn't a drunk is that he's allergic to alcohol beyond a threshold amount, and Bobby, a hacker and phone phreak who is able to exploit the telephone lines and network connections and break into any computer system.The first part of the book tells how first Kidd is recruited, and how he then recruits the three others, and how the four of them then go to work to destroy the company that has been targeted. Then the story gets more complicated and even more exciting.But this can't really be considered to be a &quot;good guys&quot; vs. &quot;bad guys&quot; story. Instead, what we have is simply &quot;us&quot; vs. &quot;them&quot;.The fact that Kidd and Co. are willing to destroy a company in order to obtain a lot of money just doesn't appeal to me, even though they justify the project in various ways. I'm guessing that the fact that the targeted company is fairly large makes the crime seem more acceptable to many people. It's not like Kidd is trying to put a mom and pop grocery store out of business - or is it?In addition to my lack of sympathy for the &quot;good guys&quot;, I also have a problem with the lack of realism in the descriptions of how the hacking was carried out and how the targeted company reacted to the hacking. Kidd's device for taping telephone lines is not viable, descriptions of how all the data files that the team received were promptly printed out on paper is ridiculous, and in reality a company that was attacked as described would have sooner or later simply restored their entire system from the backup tapes.One thing to be aware of is that this book was first published in 1989, and this makes the descriptions of the computer technology very dated. The Internet isn't mentioned (although it did actually exist at that time) and there aren't any mobile telephones or e-mail or CD-ROMs or Windows, etc. PC's are all IBM AT's or Kaypro IBM-compatibles, they communicate with mainframe computers using Hayes modems and dial-up telephone lines, and Lotus 1-2-3 is mentioned. To me this doesn't detract from the story in any way; in fact it made me feel very nostalgic. But if you weren't involved with PC-based computing in the 1980's you may find these descriptions rather strange.A final point that should be mentioned is that this is the first Kidd/LuEllen book in what has become a series. Warning: For some strange reason there is incorrect information on this subject in various editions of this book. For example, in the edition that I read it says on the page inside the front cover that the author (whose real name is John Camp) has written &quot;two previous Kidd novels.&quot; There are apparently other editions of this book where on the jacket it says that &quot;Kidd and LuEllen return&quot; in this book. But on John Sandford's official web site he makes it very clear that this IS the first Kidd/LuEllen book.Rennie Petersen",

While the Amigas and PC-ATs of yesteryear may no longer be the computing tools of choice, they really were sexy back in their day. Reading about them brought back memories and, for me at least, added to my enjoyment of the book. If you've never used anything older than a Pentium-2, that part of the story may seem hopelessly passe, but such is life.The plot may also seem a little dated, but only because it's been used as recently as the big-screen version of Charlie's Angels. Sure you can see things coming chapters ahead of time, but that's due as much to foreshadowing (Kidd's use of the Tarot comes in handy here) as predictability.Despite the presence of a lot of then-current computer equipment, the book glosses over how it's used in Kidd's crime spree. Of course, it's really hard to keep a reader's interest if you include everything in great detail (who wants to listen to the horrible screeching of a Hayes modem or get into arcane DOS commands or hear the expletives following a ***carrier dropped*** or BSoD message?). Suffice it to say that you'll learn a lot more about how to break into suburban homes through the front door than through a firewall.There's a lot of bed-hopping going on between the covers of the book. Granted, AIDS wouldn't have been big in the national consciousness at the time the book was written, but STDs in general would have been an issue. Then again, a book told from the criminal's point-of-view really can't moralize overmuch (there's also a bit of drug use, sniper-style executions, and the aforementioned housebreaking to add to the mix of kids-don't-try-this-at-home activities performed by Kidd and LuEllen).I found The Fool's Run an enjoyable read, slightly more enjoyable than The Devil's Code.

Of course, it's not that simple, but you get the idea.This novel was first published in 1989 and it aged rather well.

He gives enough of explanation to satisfy people with minimum computer knowledge, but doesn't tend to explain everything.This is not a book that leaves you breathless, it's just a fun read with sympathetic characters.I think it's perfect for a train ride or a plane flight. I'll definetly read other Kidd novels (The Empress File and The Devil Code), but, how should I put it, they are not very high on my list.If this was a new book - I would have given it 3 stars.

                "review/text": "I think just as many people were bored with Quicksilver as excited by it and for those in the former catagory, I can only say that it does get better. Many of those complaints centered around the impression that the book wasn't going anywhere, that the plot was sort of nebulous and static and most of the time it was just hordes of characters talking about things that nobody cared about. Stephenson must have listened to his critics because a number of those problems have been fixed in this, the second volume of his enormous trilogy. This novel, still gigantic but not as huge as the first volume, continues the stories already in progress, but Stephenson cleans up the pacing somewhat by dividing the story into two separate novels, but cutting back and forth between them, which fixes a huge problem I had with the first novel, namely that you had blocks of exciting, action oriented portions of the story and then when that was over it was nothing but talking heads until the end, without any break or suspense. Breaking it up works so well that I don't why he didn't do it the first time out, since it creates a sense of tension by building cliffhangers into the story and by alternating the political manipulation stuff (Eliza's sections) with the adventurer/world traveller bits (Jack Shaftoe's) it makes the novel feel more integrated, a sense that it's all happening at the same time (sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't). The novels also benefits from having a somewhat more coherent (ie straightforward) plot, in the first book everyone manipulated and schemed but it wasn't clear if it was going anywhere and the apparent lack of direction really hurt the story, making it seem flat and somewhat bland. This time out everything is much sharper, there's a definite sense that all the plotting is actually building toward something, even if it still remains to be seen if we're going to build toward something grand or something abstract. But at least all the talking and scheming has some payoffs this time out, even if those are varying quality, it's nice to see plots move forward, even if it's unclear how they impact whatever main plot is driving the book. Also on a nice note, Stephenson has reduced the number of annoying footnotes, which were far more irritating than clever (again to authors: if no one likes when David Foster Wallace does it, we won't like it when you do it). And I do give credit to Stephenson for scope and ambition, this is big novel that spans over a decent amount of time, with a huge cast of characters and a wide area of geography, touching on a variety of moods and situations. I think Stephenson does a good job of putting the reader into the late 1600's with the characters and I can't really tell which people are historical and which are just made up (other than the obvious ones). So it's a definite improvement over the first novel, but I don't see it as a &quot;great&quot; novel, it's entertaining in parts, but I really only care about some of the characters (Eliza, Jack, his brother, even the Sun King is pretty entertaining) and while the plot is stronger this time out, there's still a sense of &quot;so what?&quot; pervading the whole enterprise, everyone is running around and talking and whatnot, but it's not clear why any of this should interest us in the least (although Stephenson manages to pull off a handful of memorable moments, while the last book really had none, it was so even) and the rambling, digressive nature of the narrative really is a big hurdle, without thrilling moments or exciting prose to make the slog worthwhile. I'll have to maintain that opinion that Stephenson's book is a fitfully entertaining diversion and not the historical-literary masterpiece some are clearly hoping for. But it's too soon to give any final opinions on the work as a whole, with one book left to go it remains to be seen how he can tie this all up and what he can make of everything. So while this was decent, and a big step up from Quicksilver, I think it's the last book that is going to decide everything and let us know if it was all worth it or not. Here's hoping.",

Instead I found it dry and difficult to finish, where Cryptonomicon had been a fantastic page turner.Then I read The Confusion. Now I think I understand. Quicksilver is not to be compared to Cryptonomicon, but to the first third of Cryptonomicon, which (I seem to remember) was a little hard to get through. It is the beginning of the story where the author is planting the seeds for later developments.The Baroque Cycle is twelve books, or three volumes (of which The Confusion is the second), or countless stories, but it is one read.

Forester had decided to collaborate on an epic novel, this would have been it, except they wouldn't have written one as racy as this one is.As made clear in &quot;Cryptonomicon,&quot; Stephenson loves parallelism. This volume of &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot; is two parallel but intertwined tales:- one of The Cabal, a polyglot group of a group of one-time galley slaves who risk everything as they transport a cargo of gold literally around the world- the other of The Junto, a pan-European collection of royalty, savants and merchants who accidentally devise the modern banking system in order to transport money without moving metal.Don't read these books if you're looking for subtle character studies (though there are some subtle and witty conversations to decode). However, if you've the kind of mind that's interested in everything and how it got that way, if you enjoy a hell-for-leather tale (or two) set in exotic locales and times, or if you like to watch a brilliant literary stylist construct a story as carefully structured as a well-done sonnet, then buy this book and set aside enough time to savor it.",

That's not to say that Ludlum is not enjoyable to read, but there's so much lacking in his work compared to Stephenson's.The Confusion, as many have mentioned, is a combination of two books, one following Jack Shaftoe in his literally round-the-world exploits, the other following Eliza, Duchess of Qwhglm, etc., as she continues to rise in Europe's aristocracy. It's an ingenious device to combine the two novels in one, as the reader is left with a cliffhanger in one chapter of the first novel and spurred on in reading the other so he can learn the outcome of the first.At it's heart, so far, the Baroque Cycle is a love story. Jack and Eliza are a classic couple, torn apart by forces (for the most part) beyond their control. Around them the world of the 16th century continues to swirl, a storm of political, economic and social change, which in reality left no life untouched. Jack and Eliza seem to somehow be caught in many of the pivotal locations and events of the age, and as readers, we get swept along with them. Along the way, of course, we get a dose of the science that Stephenson loves to explain, as well as a good chunk of geography, social satire, and humor.Stephenson, while he may be getting more long winded, is getting better and better. I hate to pick favorites, because there are so many incredible authors out there, but he is certainly near the top in my book. Can't wait for The System of the World!",

                "review/text": "I'm 80% done with Confusion, and I'm loving it!The success of this book rests on the much-maligned extensive exposition of its predecessor Quicksilver. Here in this book is the beginning of the payoff for wading through the exposition. I frequently find myself chortling over it: AHahhahahaha!!!There are a few dry sections, but they invariably end with a rich payoff, for example the statue that's planned in London for the Earl of Upnor! :-DTo explain the &quot;I told you so&quot; title to this review, let me paste in my review of Quicksilver:------------------Quicksilver is just the first third of the novelReviewer: Brian Hobson from Raleigh, NC United StatesI have read most of Stephensons previous work, I have read Cryptonomicon three times, and I just finished my second reading of Quicksilver. I have also read a lot of reviews here, many of them from people who loved Cryptonomicon but did not like Quicksilver. I might be able to provide a little perspective.One of the reasons I like Neal Stephenson as a writer is that his books are not an easy read, they are a bit of a challenge. I consult a dictionary more often when reading Stephenson than any other author I can think of. Cryptonomicon was NOT an easy read; it would have been very easy to put it down in the first 25 pages and it didn't really get rolling until after page 300, after the first third. The first third of Cryptonimicon was a lot of exposition and character development which was necessary to the unfolding of the story. Readers who got through that first third were rewarded immensely in the latter two-thirds of the book.I remind you that Quicksilver is the first third of the Baroque Cycle. It is stuffed full of exposition and character, somewhat to its detriment as a stand-alone book, but I submit to you that this is necessary to the unfolding of the story of the Baroque Cycle as a whole.After reading Quicksilver the first time I read some historical non-fiction about Cromwell, The Bourbons and the Stuarts, and an excellent biography of Isaac Newton that examined his explorations in Alchemy. I appreciated Quicksilver more on the second read with this better background; I understood better how well-researched Stephenson is and I was better able to absorb the story he is trying to tell.Remember Cryptonomicon: Stephenson is teaching us about the origins of modern computers. The lesson is not an easy one and requires some effort of its readers. In my opinion the negative reviews reflect not a weakness in the book but rather a weakness or impatience in the reader. Be patient, complete the cycle. I am confident that you will be rewarded for your efforts.------------------Sit back, enjoy your reward!",

                "review/text": "Stephenson's very long historical novel, the sequel to Quicksilver is here! Confusion courses with Stephenson's scholarship but is rarely bogged down with too much historical detail. Stephenson is especially impressive in his ability to represent dialogue over the evolving worldview of seventeenth-century scientists and enliven the most abstruse explanation of theory.Though replete with science, the novel is as much about the complex struggles for political ascendancy and the workings of financial markets. Further, the novel's literary ambitions match its physical size. Stephenson narrates through epistolary chapters, fragments of plays and poems, journal entries, maps, drawings, genealogic tables, and copious contemporary epigrams. Stephenson has matched ambition to execution, and his faithful, durable readers will be both entertained and richly rewarded with a practicum in Baroque science, cypher, culture, and politics as the story continues.I'm always sad to finish long novels, because life seems so mundane afterward. For fun, if you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Perhaps, most of all, it was because Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's `Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects,' which NASA tried to ban. The possibility of NASA and Government cover-ups makes truth stranger than fiction, which is based on someone's truth. Anyway great reading all.",

                "review/text": "I expressed misgivings about \"Quicksilver\", but confess most were quieted by \"Confusion.\" A lot of the hanging threads are brought together, many questions answered, many mysteries resolved. The huge amount of exposition in the first volume sets the stage for more and faster development in the second one. By its end, many plot lines have been boiled down to one unexpected conflict to set the stage for the concluding \"The System of the World.\"\"Confusion\" is circuitous. Such a profusion of events transpire that by its end, one really does feel like two decades have passed. We find at its outset Half-Cocked Jack Shaftoe still alive, a diseased and half-crazed galley slave in a motley crew from all over the world. Led by an improbable Jewish-American Indian halfbreed, they engineer an audacious escape, propelling them ever eastward to escape the enemies they've made and exploit the unusual treasure that has fallen into their hands. Their escapades stretch out over years and thousands of miles before they begin to find their way back towards Europe and an Eliza Jack still dreams of.Eliza's life of financial, romantic and court intrigue, meanwhile, continues and develops through numerous twists and turns. She turns a moment of supreme vulnerability into a marriage vaulting her into position and power. Her kidnapped child Jean-Jacques is followed by siblings of equally complicated parentage. She uses sex - Eliza has several romps in this book - to slay a vile noble and his equally vile mistress in unusually Baroque style. But it's her financial acumen that gives her son's kidnapper an elaborate comeuppance, and other bad guys get theirs in picturesque and dramatic fashions. (You really enjoy the demise of a bad guy far more when the author has spent a thousand or more pages making him bad, than you do in a typical novel.)Daniel Waterhouse plays a lesser role than in the previous volume. He has recovered from his operation and still wants to head for America, but doesn't have the money to do so. Money is a focus here. Europe suffers from a financial crisis: the world hasn't come up with a system that can accommodate burgeoning world trade and a huge influx of silver from Spain's Latin American colonies. Waterhouse and those around him, including his patron Roger Comstock, now the Marquis of Ravenscar, mull this problem as Tories, meanwhile, plot against King William and Jacobites go to war with him in Ireland.Jack's experiences with foreign cultures provide vivid travelogue but sometimes drag, like the first volume does, with Stephenson's interminable expository style. Too much is too slowly revealed about Jack's fellows and their plan's unfolding. Eliza's portions of the book move better, perhaps because they concern characters and relationships already introduced in \"Quicksilver\" and so more quickly plow new ground. Waterhouse remains a more believable character than Jack and Eliza, but the latter two are more colorful.Postscript: In reviewing the first book I faulted Stephenson for over-arch writing such as declaring colliding Venetian gondolas \"canal rage.\" Here, though, I laughed out loud when Jack echoes the not-yet-born Frank Sinatra and says, \"These vagabond boots are longing to stray.\" I also detected a possible Bobby Darin/\"Mack the Knife\" reference near the end of the book when Stephenson manages to work \"scarlet\" and \"billows\" into the same sentence. He has such fun with this enormous work and that fun greatly outweighs its faults of rambling. And I differ with other reviewers who seem to find it a placeholder or just connective tissue; I found the first book more tedious.",

                "review/text": "Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy/Series is considered one of the great science-fiction collections ever written, forming the basis of countless derivative and inspired works over the past fifty years. The Baroque Cycle will not, unfortunately, inspire fifty years of copycats, for a unique reason: it would be far too difficult to undertake with even moderate effort. This is a nine-book/ three-volume masterpiece of historical fiction that really has no peer in my experience (and please comment if you find any!)As an aside, I could, at length, review each of the nine books and prattle on endlessly about this or that, but that's far too many reviews for what I intend to say about the Cycle as a whole. My comments apply to all books equally.The cycle begins in the mid 17th century and spans the adulthood of one Daniel Waterhouse, a fictional contemporary of Isaac Newton. Of course, it also traces the life of one Jack Shaftoe, a fictional hero with his roots in every pirate story ever written or filmed. And then there's the mysterious Enoch Root, popping up again from the Cryptonomicon to move things along as the deux ex machina of certain story elements.The number of interleaved story lines would be an impressive enough feat of writing, but the historical references were simply amazing. The sheer amount of research Mr. Stephenson invested for the Cycle must have been enormous. In short, Mr. Stephenson describes London before, during, and after the Great Fire of 1666 politically, sociologically, geographically, architecturally, and economically; he performs the same rigor of place-setting with Hanover and present-day Germany, Paris and present-day France, diverse parts of Egypt, Algeria, India, Mexico, South America, and Boston. This is the kind of book series that would inspire high-school students to PAY ATTENTION. For, if the students really do their homework and have a teacher partnered with them to put the book details into their proper context, you could quite possible craft an entire school year around the nine books, such is the depth and breadth of scholastic research involved in putting together such a series. It's no small achievement or idle boast: Mr. Stephenson has in some way taken his education and put it to its greatest use, as an inspiration to students.All of this would be for naught if the stories weren't truly excellent at their core, and they are. You could boil down the Shaftoe story line to \"pirate story\" but that sells it short after the first book -- and there are eight more to go. What starts as a pirate story quickly become something of a precursor to spycraft and terrorism/counter-terrorism in the 17th and 18th centuries: currency manipulation, political scandals, and assassinations. I haven't even mentioned Isaac Newton versus Gottfried Leibniz in the battle for Calculus, or Isaac Newton's Alchemy, the reconstruction of London post-fire, the gold trade, the silver trade, piracy in the Atlantic and Pacific, the timber economy, the commodities exchange of northern Europe, the court at Versailles, and so on. I'm astonished as I write this.This is well-worth the time invested to read, as a Cycle. If Mr. Stephenson ever posted his complete bibliography, or if some doctoral student ever decided to craft that two-semester, eight-course class tracing the book's scholarship, I would be among the first to delve deeply into it and re-learn my forgotten history, mathematics, and economics. Simply, this is one of the finest fiction series ever written.-Fred",

Here is it told from beginning to end and just seems rather bland and boring after seeing the film.

Helping him in his bid for freedom is his former partner in crime, Buddy who is waiting with a car in the prison car park. Also waiting in the car park happens to be US Marshall Karen Sisco who is sitting in her car, preparing to enter the facility when Foley makes his unexpected appearance. Quickly overpowering her, they stuff her in the trunk of her car with Foley climbing in behind her and Buddy slipping behind the wheel to affect the getaway.Unbelievably cool in the crisis involved in the jail break, Foley attempts to engage Karen in conversation, even wondering aloud whether it might be possible, if circumstances were different, for the two of them to become attracted to one another. Karen of course is incredulous and wants nothing to do with the escaped prisoner, apart from capturing him and delivering him back to prison. Thinking on the events later, after escaping from Buddy and Foley, she does find herself impressed with Foley's cool head under pressure.There is a brief lull in the action as we recover from the excitement of the opening scenes and the thought of the next score is placed in Foley's head. This takes the form of a robbery target in Detroit, supposedly a low-risk venture made easier by some local help. After narrowly escaping capture from the US Marshalls that includes another run-in with Karen Sisco, he decides that it's time for a change of scenery and he and Buddy heads north.By this time, it becomes obvious that there's some sort of weird fascination between Jack Foley and Karen Sisco taking place. They're somehow drawn to one another, even though they are on directly opposite sides of the law.In Detroit, Foley and Buddy are out of their comfort zones. They don't know the city, they don't know the people and it's just started to snow. They hook up with a truly dangerous fellow ex-con named Maurice. He is their aforementioned local help, but they realise that the low-risk operation is shaping up as anything but. With nothing better on offer and against their better judgement, they go ahead with the plan but are extremely wary.Meanwhile Karen Sisco has tracked Foley to Detroit after some very slick detective work, and after talking her way onto the Foley case. The inevitability of their meeting is obvious. What remains up in the air is what will happen after they meet and when it comes to plots created by Elmore Leonard, this means that the story could lead anywhere from here.On the surface this is told in a light, breezy tone thanks mainly to the cool behaviour of Foley in times of crisis backed up by Buddy's comical acceptance of Foley's decisions, no matter how unusual they seemed. When the setting changed to the colder wintry city of Detroit, the tone darkened considerably to reflect the dangerous Maurice, with whom they have to deal. You get a definite sense that the significant scenes are going to take place in Detroit thanks to these strong mood changes.Elmore Leonard mixes an easy conversational tone with tight, tough dialogue. He manages to give each of his characters their own distinctive voice thanks to his clever use of phraseology. Even though Foley and Buddy are ex-cons, in this book they can be considered the good guys and their language reflects this through a minimum of swearing and slang. In glaring comparison, we find that the Detroit &quot;bad guys&quot; such as Maurice, although also ex-cons, litter their dialogue with constant and extreme profanities. It's a simple but effective way to differentiate the difference between bad and downright evil.Ultimately, OUT OF SIGHT is a love story. Sure it's an unusual love story in the extreme, but a love story just the same. With plenty of action taking place on the periphery of the Foley and Sisco mating dance, it's an absorbing book that provided me with an unexpected ending.",

Federal marshall Karen Sisco attempts to stop the escape, but Buddy thwarts her attempt and forces her into the trunk of the getaway car with Foley. In the trunk, Foley and Sisco make a connection talking about things like robbing banks and movies. Soon, Sisco gets away, and the remaining story centers on Foley attempting one last job and Sisco trying to catch him (all the while dealing with the romantic and emotional connection that she shares with Foley).The story is pretty darn good. And there is a wide range of characters with well drawn criminals ranging from silly, all talk screw-ups like a stoner named Glenn to a real violent, psychotic bad guy named Maurice. The dialogue is funny, and the very quick, clever twists of story/plot make the story a pretty good, engaging read.This novel was later made into a movie by Steven Soderbergh. Even though the book is good, the movie is much better. While the tone and story are pretty similar, Soderbergh makes some welcome changes. First of all, the Leonard novel is told pretty straightforward. Soderbergh, however, mixes up the narrative using flashbacks that allow Soderbergh to develop the characters. Also, Soderbergh enhances certain scenes by adding suspense and humor (such as the climax that is really suspenseful and hilarious in the movie but by-the-numbers in the book). Finally, the film is shot well and features one great performance after another (George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Don Cheadle, Steve Zahn, Ving Rhames, Dennis Farina, Albert Brooks, Catherine Keener, Luis Guzman).",

                "review/text": "Stories about criminals trying to escape from prison have always fascinated me. They have much of the same appeal as a locked room mystery. And they also have the possibility of a good tale covering the chase after the prison is left behind. In Out of Sight, Elmore Leonard has created the most unique prison escape story that I have ever read.Here's the situation. Jack Foley, a career bank robber, has thought of a way to use a planned escape by some other convicts to help him get out. Everything goes smoothly until . . . the way out ends up being covered by a deputy U.S. marshal carrying a shotgun who's visiting the prison to serve a subpoena. What now?Sound interesting?Then, Mr. Leonard throws in a role reversal. The deputy is an attractive 28 year-old woman wearing designer clothes.I think that many of the best novels are those that propose a totally unique situation, and then let the characters deal with the situation. That seems to be how this book was written, and it's fascinating.She doesn't shoot. He ends up taking her along, and riding in the trunk with her. They start talking . . . and discover they are interested in each other. What if they had met in some other way?She escapes. Foley's on the run, and she's after him. What will happen to them?As usual, the dialogue reflects Mr. Leonard's almost-perfect ear for spoken language.Mr. Leonard's famous wit concerning the foibles of criminals is in evidence in almost every paragraph. If you are ready for lots of laughs from a crime novel, this book may well appeal to you. In fact, the book will remind you a lot of the romantic comedies that the two main characters find that they both adore. Don't be surprised if you are asked to suspend your disbelief from time to time.On the other hand, there are some truly nasty criminals in the story who do despicable things. If such events disturb or annoy you, this book's darkness should cause you to prefer another source of romantic comedy. You will see this book as a two or three star effort. I graded the book down one star for needless violence.After you have read the book or thought about the situation that kicks off the plot, think about where you may be missing opportunities to get to know others whom you would like. For example, I have just read a book by Stephen Ambrose in which he describes the pleasure that enemy commanders who have fought against each other find in their post-war friendships.Speak up or act . . . or forever miss your opportunity to connect!",

Get Shorty may be his most entertaining and funny, but Out of Sight combines all of Leonard's best features in one novel. His dialog, one of his strongest points, crackles at his best. His cast of characters includes the usual misfits and freaks, but here they range from pathetically funny to unusually scary. Jack and Karen, his lead characters, are well developed and believable, and you root for them both from their first appearance. The plot moves at a steady pace; not breakneck, but it builds to a perfect crescendo. And Leonard's toolkit to fold in backstory to develop his characters is never more effective.

                "review/text": "That dumb reviewer would be me. The last two books I have read have been Elmore Leonard novels: \"Touch\" and \"Out of Sight\". Though I am an avid film buff, and was vaguely aware of the movies of the same name, this college-educated would-be writer never put, literally, two and two together to link these books until I finished this one and read of few of the Amazon reviews. Two movies are going to be rented tomorrow, and I will look into ways to get my IQ increased. What makes me an even bigger [idiot] is that I read both of these books a few years ago, and was giving them a \"refresher\" reading before writing the reviews.So without seeing the movie, I will say that I liked the book very much. Just like \"Touch\", it's a short novel that almost makes me think I'm not reading a full book. But unlike \"Touch\", which I think could have gone on a lot longer, this one pretty much ends where it should. It tells the story of a bank robber who escapes jail. While doing so, a U.S. Marshall gets taken hostage, and the two wind up riding together in the trunk of a car as part of the getaway. I should mention that the Marshall is a very attractive young female wearing a designer outfit while stuffed in the car with the escapee.Now being a Leonard novel, you have to throw convention out the window. The \"hero\" is a career criminal, who would have to kill as part of his job if necessary. He has also just whacked a prison guard with a two-by-four after betraying the participants of another breakout to make his own getaway. So he's not really the kind of guy you bring home to dad if you are a woman.But wait, it's still a Leonard novel. The Marshall has ironically already been involved with a bank robber in her life, and is impressed how the robber acts like a gentleman during her ordeal. After she gets away, she finds herself strangely drawn to the man, a fact that is noticed by her father, himself a former lawman.So of course these two have to somehow get together again, or we wouldn't have a story. Since we know this will happen, there is no suspense there. But how both feel about it before this happens makes the novel special. As he is escaping a thirty year sentence, with more to follow if caught, and she is sworn to uphold the law, they can't possibly make it together. Or can they?See you at the video store.",

                "review/text": "OUT OF SIGHT by Elmore Leonard.STORY BRIEF:Jack has robbed hundreds of banks. He's smooth, charming, and likeable when talking to the tellers he's robbing. Karen is a Deputy U.S. Marshall. She arrived at the prison to deliver something and is getting out of her car when she sees Jack crawl out of a tunnel. He has just escaped and his getaway driver Buddy is parked next to Karen. They take Karen with them so she can't help authorities catch them. Jack gets into the trunk with Karen while Buddy drives. They have a nice conversation for about a half an hour in the trunk. Certain events happen, Karen gets free, and Jack misses her. He wants to spend time with her. He keeps thinking about what it would be like if they had met in a bar, what they would have said, what would have happened, etc. Karen gets herself assigned to the task force trying to catch Jack.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I was smiling many times during this book. I kept shaking my head with Jack's thinking and actions. He wanted to date her! He actually had contact with Karen more than once while she was trying to catch him. I've never read anything like this before. It was great because it was different, and unexpected things happened. I really liked both of these characters, Jack and Karen.Because I was smiling so much, I wanted to give this 5 stars. But I didn't because 5 stars for me needs a wonderful feeling at the end of the book. But that kind of ending could not be. He is a career criminal. At one point he said talk about an honest job to a criminal and he'll jump out the window. She has integrity, and her job is important to her. They cannot have a happy ending together. But they care about each other. Given the set-up this was probably the best ending the author could do. It was reasonable. But it was a little bit of a letdown.The book was a little slow in the middle concerning Glenn in Detroit, but I could see the need for developing that part. This book is shorter than most novels.I agree with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch which says it well. \"Elmore Leonard's ear for dialogue and imagination for plot and character make life's likable losers endlessly entertaining.\"The movie based on this book was made in 1998 staring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. One reviewer said the movie had a different ending from the book.A sequel to \"Out of Sight\" was published in 2009 called \"Road Dogs.\" It includes Jack plus characters from two other books. According to several other reviews the \"Road Dogs\" plot is weak. I have not read it.NARRATOR:The narrator George Guidall was excellent.DATA:Unabridged audiobook reading time: 6 hrs and 49 mins. Swearing language: strong, but rarely used. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: one, told not shown. Setting: current day Florida and Detroit, Michigan. Book copyright: 1996. Genre: crime fiction with a little romance. Ending: Sad yet sort of happy in a reasonable way.",

                "review/text": "ELEVENTH HOUR by Catherine Coulter was the subject of the third review that I wrote for Amazon (8/28/02), and while my five star rating might be a little generous by my current standards I enjoyed the book immensely. Despite mixed reviews, its bestseller status indicated that many other readers shared my opinion. It made me want to learn more about the adventures of (Dillon) Savich and (Lacey) Sherlock, the husband and wife team who are the two main characters in Coulter?s ?FBI Thriller Series?. I was especially intrigued by the ?two for one? aspect of the story; there were two mysteries to be solved that were cleverly woven together as an integral element of the plot. Therefore, I eagerly awaited the next entry in the series, BLINDSIDE (review 7/28/03); unfortunately, while it bore superficial resemblance to the earlier book, the storytelling and the editing were very disappointing and the second mystery was seemingly included as an afterthought. Much to my disappointment, BLOW OUT, the latest installment in the series is even more poorly written and edited. It appears that the author and her publisher have decided that Sherlock and Savich have such a loyal fan club that a peremptory effort at telling a story and the continuation of the two-for-one mystery format will be sufficient inducement for her loyal readers. Well, I am officially going on strike with regard to the purchase of future books in this series until I read some glowing reviews by reviewers whose judgment I trust. I will instead content myself by reading some of Coulter?s much more highly praised earlier stories.As my review title indicates, my greatest disappointment with regard to this story is that with a little additional effort and a lot better job of editing this could have been a first rate book. For some reason, perhaps to grab the reader?s interest, the book opens with a riveting action sequence which turns out to part of an interesting but totally peripheral plot. Savich encounters an apparition and gets involved in an unsolved murder that occurred thirty years ago. It almost seems that perhaps this story began as the author?s primary interest but she wasn?t sure that she could turn it into a believable full length novel so threw it in as a twofer that provides some interesting asides and gives us readers more for our money. Suddenly, the action switches to DC, where the brutal murder of a Supreme Court Justice inexplicably occurs within the library of the Court itself despite the incredibly tight security that prevails. When additional murders occur, it appears that a very bold and fiendishly clever murderer has an agenda to fulfill. Additional characters are introduced including Ben Raven, the liaison from the DC Metro Police, and Callie Markham, the stepdaughter of the murdered Justice, who in a totally unbelievable fashion is teamed with Ben in order to utilize her unique insights into the case and her analytical skills honed as an investigative reporter for THE WASHINGTON POST. And for fans of the series, MAX, Dillon?s computer sidekick, provides invaluable help before the chase is over. Unfortunately, much of the dialog is totally inappropriate and becomes almost laughable at times. Furthermore, the paragraph breaks often make it unintelligible who is actually speaking. There are on occasion paragraph breaks in the middle of comments by the same speaker; at times, the narrative perspective seems to suddenly change. Finally, the romantic subplot is so predictable it lacks any interest at all.In summary, a potentially interesting villain and a plot with great potential have been sacrificed to the apparent desire to keep to a publishing schedule of a book each summer. I only generously rounded my rating up because there are two aspects of the book which certain readers will enjoy. First, there is some minimal further character development for the truly devoted fans of Savich and Sherlock; the true series addicts will probably enjoy this element. Second, the plot?s potential is interesting although unrealized. Very surprisingly, the distribution of the ratings of this book by the seventeen previous reviewers exhibits a wide dispersion of opinion. The average of three stars to date derives from an entirely level distribution ? three readers each rated it one, three or five stars, four readers each rated it two or four stars. I believe that this difference of opinion reflects how different types of readers relate to the various factors that I mention in this review. Someone who is perhaps a speed reader and primarily interested in a plot (or two) with some interesting twists might easily overlook many of the features that I consider to be very significant flaws. Much of my interest in reading derives from the subtleties of character development, the intricate details which clever writers weave into the fabric of their stories, and the careful construction of the narrative and a wonderful use of language. By definition, any subjective rating system incorporates how an individual reader balances all these diverse factors when deciding which books provide a pleasurable and worthwhile experience. The strengths of this book no where near compensated me for the severe weaknesses with regard to any of those factors.Tucker Andersen",

The motive for the murders as the body pile mounts up is absolutely absurd, and the twist at the end totally falls flat. I felt really cheated by this book. It was nice to see Sherlock and Dillon and their little boy, but the whole relationship between Ben and his lady love is a wet squib and the macho posturing in the living room of Savich's home is just absurd.

I guess the building was just open to anyone. The characters were one dementional and even in very stressful times the dialogue was &quot;very cute&quot; and supposedly witty. The final resolution was as unrealistic as the plot and character development. Honestly, I would have to say that this book was written by someone else who just took the name of Catherine Coulter.

He saw the evil of facism spreading throughout Europe and used contemporary events as the backdrops for his stories. His stories incorporate the struggle between the liberal values of the Western Democracies and the warped values of the facist police state. With perfect hind sight, we know that Eric Ambler got it right. He was no appeaser and had no problems in knowing and saying that Nazi Germany and Facist Italy were deeply evil states.After the Second World War, Ambler's first books picked up many of the same themes he developed in his pre-war stories. The locale shifted from Western Europe to the newly Communist Eastern Europe and Balkans. Ambler knew evil when he saw facism and he recognized it again in the newly totalitarian Communist police states. Ambler was no fellow traveler and once again history showed that he was right in his assesment.State of Seige was written in 1956 and takes place in a newly independent Southeast Asian nation. An Islamic Fundamentalist military coup is taking place, and an English engineer gets front row seats to the proceedings.This book was published two years after the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu and during the middle of Britain's sucessful anti-communist struggle in Malaysia. With his usual nose for being in the right place at the right time, Ambler gives us his take on the newly indpendent nations of Southeast Asia. Without giving too much away, Ambler once again got it right in his assesment of history.As usual, Ambler's writing is elegant. State of Seige is a straight forward story and lacks the usual Ambler twists and turns. It is both a great suspense story and an opportunity to see how an English writer viewed the end of colonialism. It is an interesting take on the post colonial world worthy of Graham Greene or Jean Larteguy.",

The local political situation is a little dicey after the revolutionary party finds itself having a hard time actually running the country. The dam project has been affected by the arrival of surplus military officer liaison. One was dependable, a Major Suparto, who plays a key role in the rest of the story.Fraser then finishes up, and flies over rebel lines to the capital to wait for his flight back to England in three days. He borrows an apartment from a friend while he's away, arranges for a beautiful woman to accompany him for the three days, and settles down for a little rest and relaxation.That seeming tranquility is shattered when the rebels take advantage of military maneuvers away from the capital to seize control of the radio station and key areas in the center city, just where Fraser is staying. He finds himself surrounded by rebels, who aren't sure whether to kill or ignore him. Then, his mere proximity to the rebel leaders draws him into the vortex of the conflict. Over 24 hours, he finds himself forced to make many difficult choices if he is to stay alive for another day . . . and protect the life of Rosalie Linden, who would not survive without him.The story is a delight in character development. With all of the stress involved in a coup d'etat, we see people for who they really are . . . as the life and death challenges peel away their exterior masks. Fraser, Suparto, Rosalie, and Sanusi (the rebel leader) are especially well done and interesting.The plot is a neat one, showing realistically the shadowy calculations required to seize and retain control of a newly independent country.After you finish the book, think about what you would have done if you were Fraser in the same situation. Could you have made better choices than he did? If not, why not?Donald MitchellCo-author of The 2,000 Percent Solution, The Irresistible Growth Enterprise, and The Ultimate Competitive Advantage",

                "review/text": "In the part of the world once known as the East Indies, The Republic of Sunda, a former Dutch colonial outpost, struggles with its new found independence. Unfortunately, the ruling government is both corrupt and ineffectual, setting the stage for civil war.Steve Fraser, a British engineer completely disinterested in the nuances of internal Sundanese politics, finds himself right in the middle of the military conflict. In typical Eric Ambler fashion, he becomes the novel's unlikely protagonist.State of Siege is a remarkable work of fiction. In it, Ambler touches on a number of geopolitical issues without clubbing the reader over the head with dogma. Moreover, neither the government nor the rebels are presented as being morally superior to the other. Both are shown to be seriously flawed entities. In other words, rather than romanticizing the conflict, Ambler presents it with realism.The narrative is taut, fast paced and compelling. Quite an achievement especially when one considers that well over 50% of the story unfolds entirely within the confines of a single building. Originally published in 1956, State of Siege contains a number of important messages remarkably relevant to today's international scene. Highly recommended.",

                "review/text": "when the days of the siege are fulfilled. Ezekiel.In many respects, Eric Ambler was to the modern British suspense novel what Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett were to the American detective novel. Ambler transformed the suspense novel from a simplistic black and white world of perfect good guys versus nefarious bad guys into a far more realistic world where sometimes the difference between good and evil is not all that great. In a series of books written before World War II Ambler would typically take an unassuming, unsuspecting civilian and immerse him in a world of mystery and intrigue in pre-war Europe. In those books the `hero' would find himself facing danger at the hands of the nazis or fascists.Once the war ended Ambler's plots reflected a change in the world's political situation. The typical Ambler protagonist now found themselves at odd with other totalitarian forces such as the Soviet bloc (Judgment at Deltchev). In addition, Ambler broadened his geographic horizons and set some of his books in post-war Asia. In these instances the plot usually found itself centered on the intrigue that settled around the newly emerging nations of Asia as the old Europe ended its lingering colonial presence. \"State of Siege\" is set in an emerging democracy seething with unrest. Although written in 1956 Ambler pits the might of a secular but increasingly corrupt regime against faith-based insurgents who believe that the creation of an Islamic state would purge the country of corruption and moral decay. As such this book seems more than a bit prophetic.The typical Ambler protagonist in State of Siege is one Steven Fraser. He is an Englishmen just finishing up a three-year stint as an engineer in a rural area of the new nation of Sunda. Fraser has just finished building a series of rural dams that will bring electrification to the countryside. The mythical Sunda is an island nation close to Indonesia. It has an indigenous population that is mostly Muslim and was formerly a Dutch colony. As the story opens Fraser is getting ready to return to Britain. Before leaving his camp he travels to the capital where he plans to obtain an exit visa before continuing his journey home. He soon finds himself smack dab in the middle of a revolt. Fraser, along with his girl friend (and the story of that relationship runs parallel to the main plot) find themselves prisoners at the headquarters of the rebel insurgents.The remainder of the plot plays out almost like an old fashioned parlor mystery. All the main actors are in one location as the story unfolds. By limiting the scope of the action Ambler allows the reader to hone in on the character of Fraser, his lady friend and the rebels. Ambler does an excellent job, as always with character development. The story is as much an exploration of the inner lives and motivations of the `actors' as a pot boiler mystery. One of the nice things about Ambler's work was his refusal to draw black and white caricatures. His portrayal of Fraser and the plotters is free of clich&eacute;. These are human beings with all sorts of motives, good and bad, for their actions.As the plot unfolds there are some good plot twists that were not obvious to me while at the same time were not far fetched. The climax was satisfactory in large part because Ambler does not sacrifice a sense of reality for totally happy endings.As I continue to read Ambler's body of work I grow increasingly impressed by his ability to maintain my interest. His books have interesting plots and his characters are real, not wooden. State of Siege is no exception. Anyone interested in Ambler or Alan Furst or who would like to know what inspired the likes of John le Carre and Ian Fleming would be well advised to pick up State of Siege. Highly recommended.L.

The main premise of a crime solved via an old movie is interesting and could have been better developed, but I feel Deaver just did an adequate job.I do recommend that you read this novel because it is an enjoyable read and it contains the trademark Deaver twists, but you shuld be forewarned that this book will not enthrall you like Bone Collector, Coffin Dancer, Empty Chair, Maiden's Grave, or Devil's Teardrop.

While some of his other work was 5 star material, MANHATTAN IS MY BEAT left me a little dissapointed.Rune is a homeless girl squatting in a skyscraper and working in a vido store. She loves old movies and fairy tales. When picking up a tape, she finds a favorite customer dead. She believes that his killer and the location of a long lost million dollars is hidden in the film he rented so often. Her prying exposes her to a world of danger and she manages to bring her few friends into the mix with her.As with any Deaver tale, there are twists and turns, and plot flips. The ending leaves you with literary whiplash. The main character Rune's obsession with fairy tales leads to forced analogies and the book can drag as a result. The ending is too tidy as to be somewhat unbelievable. I do wish that Deaver would have devoted more of the narrative to the villain(s) as he does with some of his more interesting works.Overall, it is a quick read with a good amount of suspense and intrigue, but it falls short of Deaver's better novels.",

                "review/text": "I've been hooked on Deaver since I read THE BONE COLLECTOR. I was pleasantly surprised by MANHATTAN... I found it to be an excellent example of some of the basics that make Deaver novels so much fun. He has created one of the most enjoyable lead characters here in Rune, a somewhat kooky, plucky 20-year-old with a vivid imagination and romantic ideals. She meets up with even more interesting characters in Mr. Kelly, Tony (her boss), Stephanie, Raoul Elliott, Sandra, Haart, Zane, Richard, etc. This is a classic in-the-wrong-place-at-the-wrong-time story as Rune accidentally interrupts the murderer of her friend, Mr. Kelly. Throw in some assumptions about the killing, some crime-solving techniques Rune has learned from movies, cops, bad guys and lusty roommates, and you have a formula for a light, fun mystery. And with most Deaver novels, you never really know who anyone actually is until the end.I truly enjoyed reading this novel. As an earlier Deaver work, it's not as polished as some we've seen more recently. However, I liked that this one seems to be all about the joy of writing a good story rather than the chore of writing for the masses. I recommend this one; it's quick and it's fun. I, for one, vote for a series starring the very loveable Rune.",

She becomes obsessed with plot of the movie as it is based loosely on a true crime. She thinks she can solve the case find the money and live happily ever after. This plot is hard to follow at times and sometimes I don't think the author is aware of what he wants the characters to do. I have read his later books and know he can write a good thriller. Too bad this book falls flat, I believe his publisher re-released to capitalize on his famous status.

The main character starts out with nothing, and attempts to recruit his former neighbors and family members to his cause. The rejection leads him to Solaris VII, where he must fight to gain the materiel he needs for his personal vendetta. He is there but a few days before leaving for Outreach to find a contract for his new merc unit, and to recruit more personnel. Everything works out relatively neat and tidy. It just does not read like a good novel, with the convenience of events and the results.Also, given the back cover text, I had expected more along the lines of a Solaris-set novel, but the story stays on that world for a comparatively short time. Much more time is spent on the world that the unit is contracted to defend. And the antagonism there again reads like something from a poorly-designed RPG campaign, with the local strife resulting in an action by that planet's leaders unlike any other in the Battletech universe. The story climaxes with combat against Clan invaders, with the occasional pointless death thrown in, I assume to highlight the random savagery of war, but seemingly tacked on as an afterthought.I was really disappointed in this novel. Note, however, that the sequel is vastly superior and very much worth the read, while this one is sure to languish on my shelf without getting a second read.",

The battle against the Clans is a little too easy towards the end, and I regret not telling a little more about Comstar.
