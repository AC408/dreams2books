                "review/text": "The Nelson Study Bible NKJV is a Bible School in a briefcase. First, throughout the text are key definitions of Hebrew and Greek words set off in a separate box. These definitions, cued to the Strong's numbering, are easy to read, accessible, and meaningful. Study notes are lucid, especially with their historical background. Of particular use to praise/worship leaders and songwriters, is the addition of the thematic outline of many of the Psalms in the study notes. All of the Psalms are song lyrics (not poems). The word Psalms is from the Greek psalmoi (and the Hebrew mizmer) which means to pluck. Hence, Psalms is an arranging term from the Temple indicating that these songs are to be performed with plucked stringed instruments. For Christian songwriters, these study notes can be an invaluable guide to not only better understanding the individual lyric, but equally in creating your own new ones.The text has a very balanced view of the Holy Spirit which few should find fault with. NT study notes are equally lucid especially in explaining certain cultural issues, alternate translation possibilities, and clarifying difficulties from the NKJV translation of the Pauline epistles.Center column references are very practical and useful. There is a brief subject index for those liking the Thompson Chain Reference approach, and an excellent concordance spanning about 200 pages. There is a comprehensive outline for each Bible book, nearly as deep as G. Campbell Morgan's Analyzed Bible.The graphic layout is quite good and easy to read. Of all study Bibles of all translations, I rank this #1, followed by the NIV Study Bible, and the Spirit Filled Life Bible (NKJV - Jack Hayford Editor), and Dake (KJV only). Thompson's has a totally separate study approach and therefore isn't quite comparable to the others.Key word for this study Bible: balanced.A readership note: The NKJV is about a 12th grade reading level. By comparison, newsmagazines are written with a 7th grade reading vocabulary. Readers looking for an easier reading translation would do well to consider getting the New Living Translation to complement the Nelson Study Bible NKJV.I've selected the Nelson's as the study Bible of choice for Alexander University students taking our online Christian songwriting classes.",

I wanted a study version though so I could get through the tougher parts without being baffled at the language or meanings. I purchased the Nelson version after reading many positive reviews and feel I made a great choice! Understandably, you need to be careful with study bibles in case you begin to adopt the editors' slant on things, but from what I can tell the Nelson team has done a fine job of retaining the integrity of the NKJV translation in their commentaries.I'm still on the Old Testament (2 Kings right now) and I've throughly enjoyed most every single chapter so far. Thanks to the well-written and not-too-long commentaries on many verses it's easy to comprehend the significance of the passages and understand some of the ancient practices prevalent at the time.Great maps in-text and at the back, helpful tables of dates and events, thorough cross-referencing, definitions of especially meaningful words in the Hebrew context, as well as in-text discussions of major concepts make this a definitive study bible for any NKJV reader and also as a reference work.",

The devotional quality is achieved primarily through the tone of the copious and scholarly notes, which are reverent, main stream, and remarkably non-intrusive. I have a number of other study Bibles, and have generally found them lacking.I appreciate the lofty literary style of the King James (Authorized) version, and wanted to try the New King James (NKJV). I have spent hours comparing the two versions. The poetic books are almost unchanged except for long obsolete words, pronouns and inflectional verb endings. The meter is unchanged. Other books have been further updated with modern sentence structure where it is most needed. The result still sounds magnificent and timeless, and glows like a freshly restored work of art.The Nelson SB contains a remarkably comprehensive concordance which contains proper nouns and describes them within the concordance listing. Thus the concordance can also be regarded as a Bible dictionary.There are eight pages of color maps in the rear. I would have liked a color map showing the twelve tribes at the time of the judges (after Joshua's conquest of Canaan), but the intext maps show this very nicely, so this is a quibble.Nelson's SB is most remarkable for its highly tailored, complete and accurate annotations, which can only have been achieved through a devotion to the work and a lot of toil. This book is quite evidently a labor of love, and this, more than any other quality ranks it as the finest SB I've encountered.I received the black bonded leather edition. Its Gold stamped quality leather cover and gold edged paper, as well as the overall high quality of workmanship make this book a delight to the senses. A real treasure all 'round.",

This translation is very clear and throughout its tenor maintains a strong stabilty as the words flow together with eloquence. Certainly, the editors and contributers of this translation achieved what was necessary for producing such an excellent Bible.The foreward proves itself very welcoming by concisely exerting the main features as a helpful tool in studying the Word of God. The preface explains the history of the NKJV, the precision and accurracy of the translation, the devotional style for the reader, and the general format for the Old and New Tesaments as a whole.Some aspects that will be beneficial and enjoyable while reading this Bible are the in-depth prolouges that describe who the author was, when it was wrote, and for what purpose the author served in writting the book. On top of all of this are finely arranged outlines and timelines to further your aquiantance with the general themes of that particular time in antiquity. There are 350 words held equivocal in this translation, so the scholars provived a section for these terms and called it 'word focus.' The words are discussed with regard to the context in which they are used, and their meanings and biblical usage are explained wonderfully. Also the scholarly commentary, the vast array of maps, pictures, charts, graphs, and cross-references add all the more radiance to this edition. To cap it off, there lies in the back a subject index to the annotations and special features provided in this Bible. Following that I found the Concordance and colorful maps in the back to further add prestige to the Nelson Study Bible.So for the overall quality of this Bible I would highly recommend this work to anyone who wishes to grasp ahold of a great study bible. For the evangelist, pastor, and lay person alike, the Nelson Study Bible will be a tool to refine yourself as a Christian, and to bring those who are less familiar with the faith to reconciliation with God.",

It looks great, but after a little use, it falls apart.Some of the graphics in this Bible are excellent. The frequent maps are helpful and the diagrams really explain the text. The page layout is clear and neat. The cross-references are thorough and have some fun features.But the annotations are awful. The annotators either ignore, or are unaware of, modern scholarship. The introduction to Genesis reads, \"Genesis was written and compiled by Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai\" (p. 1), ignoring source criticism. Song of Songs is \"a moving love story about a young country girl and King Solomon\" (p. 1097), ignoring the difficulties in interpretating this text. The annotations are padded with paraphrastic summary, and when they give information they tend to enter polemics (\"Mary was blessed because she received God's grace, not because she bestowed it\" [p. 1686]) or excuses (\"The apostles did not take Jesus' words to mean that they had the power to forgive sins\" [p. 1808]).Some of the features are superfluous. The \"WordFocus\" studies highlight words in Greek or Hebrew and give them lengthy explanations. This reflects an unfortunate Evangelical trend where people ignorant of Greek or Hebrew do \"word study\" with a lexicon. This leads to invalid doctrinal conclusions (cf. D. A. Carson's \"Exegetical Fallacies\").Some of the charts are great, but most are not. For example, see \"Isaiah: A Bible in Miniature?\" (p. 1144). Here we learn that Isaiah has \"66 chapters\" while the Bible has \"66 books.\" Entertaining, but a waste of space.Dr. Radmacher's essay on how to read the Bible is poor. The essay works from his premise, \"meaning is singular\" (p. xiii), which is not an historical Christian way of approaching the Bible. This \"fundamentalist\" approach is a disservice to both Fundamentalists and others.Finally, the binding: some of the pages fell out of the back after a year.If you want an explicitely Protestant study Bible, there are a host of others.

Also, I happen to prefer the \"Open\" with its dictionary at the beginning of the book, as it makes a nice buffer between Genesis and the cover. It greatly reduces wear in the spine in the first couple of books. The full color pages in the \"Nelson\" that I just mentioned make thumbing through the Bible a little difficult, as your page flipping becomes hindered by passing a glossy thick page every fow hundred pages. They just make the book overall open and lay awkwardly. The \"Open's\" layout is simpler and better, I think, and leaves much more Bible text per page. It's not cluttered with hundred of magazine-article like topic headings. In short, it's not worth the money to switch to the Nelson.Now, if you have neither, I suppose the best idea is to get a \"Nelson.\" For one, the \"Open\" is discontinued, so I guess you'd have no other choice in most cases, depending on which edition you're interested in, although there are still a few \"Opens\" for sale on Amazon. Overall, the \"Nelson\" is very full and informing. It makes a great secondary Bible, and if you don't mind many pages containing only a few paragraphs of Bible text, a great primary Bible.Doctrinally, the \"Nelson\" is fairly middle of the road. Pretty much any Christian would find this Bible usefull and non-threatening to their personal beliefs.Of all of the major study Bibles, the Nelson is quite the best choice for anyone.",

I've used The King James Study Bible by Thomas Nelson for a few years, and it's been extremely useful and informative. My wife uses The New Spirit Filled Bible (NKJV) which is also by Thomas Nelson. Those are the two Bibles I'll use in comparison to The Nelson Study Bible.The strength of this Bible is in the annotations at the bottom of each page. Nearly every verse is expounded upon. While I can't fault the editors for being thorough, the sheer volume of the notes causes one to bypass them altogether, unless he has a question about a specific verse. This version does not have any form of The King James Study Bible's Doctrinal Footnotes to lead the reader through a systematic study of the Bible's teachings. Nor does it offer Personality Profiles or Archaeological Sites, as the KJV does.This version does offer WordFocus Word Studies, which are very similar to Word Wealth offered in the New Spirit Filled Bible. In both versions, these are sprinkled throughout the text near relevant verses. Finding a particular word study is no problem in the Spirit Filled Bible, because there is an alphabetical listing of them at the front of the book. However, in this version the listing is not alphabetical, but instead lists them in the order they appear in the book, making it very difficult to find any particular word. The same is true of the listings for the \"InDepth Articles,\" the \"QuickView Charts,\" and the \"InText Maps.\" How hard would it have been to list these alphabetically? The WordFocus studies are not even cross-referenced in the text as they are in the Spirit Filled Bible, so finding one occurance of a word won't help you find its word study.Most Bibles have a section in the back where miscellaneous materials can be found. Things like a harmony of the Gospels, listings of the teachings of Christ, etc. This Bible does have many of these features, but they are spread randomly throughout the text. They are all listed in the tables of contents, but I've already described what a catastrophe those are.Despite the claims that this Bible was years in the making, I feel it is basically shovel-ware. There is little organization, and the features that are included are not easy to find. If bottom-of-the-page annotations are what you're after, this Bible offers lots of them. But if you're looking for comprehensive study features similar to those in The King James Study Bible, keep looking. That's what I'm going to do.",

        "description": "This is a history of the King James Version of the Bible (known in Britain as the Authorised Version) over the four hundred years from its remote beginnings to the present day. Gordon Campbell, expert in Renaissance literatures, tells the fascinating and complex story of how this translation came to be commissioned, of who the translators were, and of how the translation was accomplished. The story does not end with the printing of that first edition, but introduces the subsequent generations who edited and interacted with the text. The present text of the King James Version differs in thousands of small details from the original edition. Campbell traces the textual history from 1611 to the establishment of the modern text by Oxford University Press in 1769. Attitudes to the King James Version have shifted through time and territory, ranging from adulation to deprecation and attracting the attention of a wide variety of adherents. It is more widely read in America today than in any other country, and its particular history in there is given due attention. Generously illustrated with reproductions taken from early editions, this volume helps to explain the enduring popularity of the King James Version throughout the world today.",

It uses the accurate RSV translation, and includes the study notes of great scholars like Bruce Metzger and Herbert May. I found the essays at the end of the Bible helpful as well, especially in an Old Testament class. The RSV (and NRSV) also offers the entire apocrypha/deuterocanon accepted by major Christian churches, which will enhance study.This New Oxford Bible is slightly different than the NRSV version. Many of the notes are identical to those included in the NRSV version, or else they are very similar. The text itself is of course different. The RSV contains archaic language in the Psalms, and has no inclusive language, among other differences. The NRSV however, makes more use of the better texts, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls.Overall I would say this Bible is written from more of a Christian faith perspective than the NRSV counterpart. One example I noticed is in the Introduction to Isaiah in the RSV, where it mentions Jesus as the incarnate suffering servant. This is omitted in the NRSV, probably in a desire to make it more ecumenical among Non-Christian religions.Overall I think this is a great Bible to own. The scholarship is excellent and embraces Biblical Criticism, while coming from a perspective of faith. The translation is beautiful and readable. I am proud to include this is my collection of Bibles for both personal and academic use.",

The RSV and Apocrypha is the only Bible translation that the Roman, Orthodox and most Protestant denominations have authorized for use. Although the RSV's successor, the New Revised Standard Version is allowed for personal study in the US Catholic Church, it is not authorized for use in the Liturgy. While the Canadian Catholic Church does use the NRSV in some of its lectionary readings, this is largely because they were prematurely printed and they will be replaced eventually. The Orthodox Church in America has rejected the use of the New RSV for liturgical use AND teaching the faith (such as bible studies within the parish) thought it is OK for personal study. So, as it stands, the RSV is the only translation that is officially used by Roman, Orthodox and most protestant churches. That's enough for me to use it, but it also helps that it is a great translation, though I echo a former commentators view about the translation of Isaiah 7:14, at least the RSV does not go so far as to irregularly use \"mortal\" for Son of Man (especially in Daniel) in the Old testament and not the New, or use \"pale green horse\" instead of the traditional pale horse in Revelation. So, I highly recommend the RSV with apocrypha as a great translation for anyone who likes a bible that is current in scholarship, reverent with language and ecumenical in use.[Update: when I wrote this review several years ago, it appeared that the Canadian Roman Catholic Church would be forced to replace their lectionary texts that used the NRSV.

The Messianic passages in the origninal Hebrew texts became more intense with the translation of the Scriptures from Hebrew to the Greek circa 200 BC. Tradition holds that the Septuagint, known as the Book of Seventy, was translated from Hebrew to Greek by 70 elders in Alexandria over a period of 70 days. A somewhat obscure conflict in the history of the church has arised over the number of books contained in the Bible, and the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant Old Testaments list different numbers of books as being canonical, or of Divine Inspiration. Martin Luther only accepted the books originally in Hebrew, which excluded ten &quot;Apocryphal&quot; books in the Roman Catholic Canon and which were known to the Catholics and Orthodox as &quot;deutero-canonical&quot; i.e. later added to the Canon and being of equal value to the Hebrew Scriptures. In many Bibles translated into English, such as the King James the Apocrypha was included, but in 1825 they were removed from publication along with the rest of the Bible. In this Bible, the RSV, the entire text of the Septuagint, including Luther's so called &quot;Apocryphal&quot; (&quot;hidden&quot;) books is here tranlated. Some books in the Septuagint never made it into the Western Latin Translation of the Vulgate, such III and IV Maccabees and Psalm 151. The names of the &quot;Apocryphal&quot; books are these: I and II Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to the Book of Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach (aka Ecclesiasticus or &quot;Church Book&quot;), Baruch, Letter of Jeremiah, Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Young Men, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, Prayer of Manasseh, I, II, III and IV Maccabees and Psalm 151. The RSV translation is better than the NRSV (New Revised Standard Version) because of the NRSV's use of fabricated gender-inlcusive language and non-traditional renderings of the text. The RSV has the same problem, most notably in the controversy in the translation of Isiah 7:14 from Hebrew where the Hebrew reads &quot;young woman&quot; while the Greek reads &quot;virgin&quot; (the KJV followed the Greek translation). However the RSV is an older and more conservative translation. The notes accompanying the text may be good for historical context and ancient culture, but they offer little spiritual wealth, merely reflecting the PC views of modern academia. But the RSV's strength in this translation and this edition lies in that it is the only Bible given approval between the Orthodox, Catholic and mainline Protestant Churches.",

The introductions and notes are, for the most part useful, but do represent a slight liberal protestant bias (see for example the notes on John 6). Also, the DeuteroCanonical books are included in an appendix in the back and should be either placed between the two testaments or in canonical order. Nevertheless, this is the most ecumenical edition of the Bible available in a translation that is liturgically acceptable to Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox. I would use this Bible along with the New Jerusalem Bible.",

                "review/text": "As an Eastern Orthodox Christian looking for a Bible for personal reading, I pored over a number of versions before settling on this one. If you're Orthodox, it's hard to find a Bible with all the books. This one has all the books, even to the point of including 4 Maccabees, which (as I understand it) is on somewhat shaky ground even among the Orthodox.So this isn't a bad choice, I suppose. Unfortunately, it relegates the Apocrypha to the end, after the New Testament. A more appropriate place would be between the Old and New Testaments, since that's the time period during which many of the books of the Apocrypha were written.Also, the Old Testament included is the standard Masoretic Text corrected from other sources. But the Orthodox canonical Old Testament is the Septuagint (LXX).So it's not really an Orthodox Bible. Nonetheless, it's a better choice than, say, the NIV, and for personal reading it's probably the best option until a real Orthodox Bible comes out in English.Also, I had the impression that the RSV was written in stilted English not far different from the KJV. It turns out that's not the case at all. The RSV translation uses some archaic forms in address to God (\"Hallowed be Thy name\" and all that), but otherwise it's in perfectly modern, and quite readable, English. The typeface is easy to read, too.And whatever you make of the various source theories and such, there's no doubt that the annotations enhance the reading experience, drawing things out of the text that you might not have noticed (for instance, the nature of the changes made in 1-2 Chronicles to the original source material in 1-2 Samuel and 1-2 Kings).So if you've concluded (as I have) that you're likely to die of old age before a genuine Orthodox Bible comes out in English, this is a good choice to use in the meantime.",

The strengths of this SB are:1) Excellent introductions to the books of the Old and New Testaments, including full discussions of the issues over authorship and historical and social contexts2) Helpful essays on interpretation at the end3) Inclusion of the Apocrypha, with commentary4) A helpful concordance at the end.However, this Bible also has some faults. The commentary is rather dry, languid and uninspiring; often you feel the authors are as dusty and dry as this book would be after sitting in the Oxford Theology library for half a century or so. At other times, the commentary leaps to some obscure point which the commentators assume the student would know (not all of us are Oxford students!) while other important sections are only given a very cursory examination (for example, the purpose and ideas in the 'Law' books of the Pentateuch are not explained, and the notes on very important books like Ezekiel, Daniel, Revelation, etc do not really help much in interpretation). Some more clarity and liveliness in the exposition would certainly have helped make the Bible come more alive, which the NIV commentators seem to be able to do with such grace and elegance.If you are a fundamentalist or evangelical, this Bible is probably not for you, unless you want to get a more liberal viewpoint. I would recommend the NIV, which sticks to the principle of the Bible being the 'God-breathed, infallible word of God.' Evangelicals will like the allowance of historical and literary criticism without compromising the scriptures themselves, and fundamentalists will probably also like the refusal to depart to a more liberal agenda. If you are fairly liberal though like I am, this is a pretty good resource, the flaws in the commentary aside, though a good Bible dictionary and commentary (such as the New Interpreter's Bible Set, or the NIV Commentary) are also necessary resources in my view for any serious bible study.This is a pretty good investment for your money and a useful study bible to add to your collection.",

Jesus' words are NOT red, granted it wasn't advertised as such. Oxford has very oddly placed all of the Apocrypha and it's indroductory notes at the very end of the book, past the end notes that proceed Revelation. They just kind of slapped the Apocryphal section between the extra blank note pages and the maps. Why they didn't place it between the Old and New Testaments is a mystery to me but that's Oxford for ya! Well, as long as it's got the Apocrypha and all those great notes, I'm happy.",

                "review/text": "With possibly one of the strongest opening lines in history, the Holy Bible really starts off swinging. Here we're not only introduced to the main character, named God, but are also informed that he's some sort of magical being (whether that's a vampire or a wizard or something, we don't know yet - we just know he can fly and shoot laser beams). The prose in this section is simply top notch, and you'll find that the action, atmosphere and language of the Holy Bible are carried off with a master's touch. But accompanying this impressive show of skill is also one of the book's greatest flaws: Verbosity. One of the first things they teach you in any writer's workshop is that every word in a novel should be integral to the story; never leave anything in that doesn't absolutely need to be there. So, while we as readers start the book all sweeping through demons and darkness like Ronnie James Dio - rocking out and firing lightbeams and building people out of dirt - it all quickly gets bogged down in unnecessary detail.As readers we're enthralled by the mystic action; wondering exactly what kind of creature this God is, why he has these powers and what on earth he's going to do with them, and then all of a sudden we're pulled out of the action and forced to sit idly while the author describes an entire week (day by day) in God's life. I mean, that's great and all that we're getting some backstory on his character, but honestly, what happened with paragliding through Hell? I don't really care what your Wednesdays are like, or on which days you like to rest - get back to the action! Jesus, if we wanted to hear about your day, we would read your LiveJournal, Christ.Due to the presence of these tangents, a lot of readers won't stick around for the meat of the story, and that would certainly be a shame because once it gets going, it really is one of the most exciting reads around (just to give you an idea of how good it is, the book has apparently gathered such an intense fanbase that some people give it away for free on the streets!). The first half of the book, called the Old Testament, is really more about getting a feel for the setting than it is advancing the story. During this time we get a glimpse of God's troubled past and are witness to a few key events that really allow the depth of the character to shine through (he's kind of a dark anti-hero; quick tempered and sometimes spiteful - but much like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, he actually has a heart of gold deep down).The author takes this set-up time to explore the world thoroughly. But while even supporting characters are given their moment to shine, sometimes that gets distracting. For example, during Moses' adventures, we come to relate to him as a troubled sort of everyman. Sure, he was adopted by royalty, but he never really became complacent. He saw the mistreatment and suffering of the people around him, and he was moved into taking action. All good so far, right? It's kind of like Footloose or a Bruce Springsteen song: It's all about the plight of the working man. (And honestly, who exemplifies the working man more than slaves? All they do is work!)It's a simple little story of class conflict and redemption, and then, almost without warning, everything suddenly gets magical: Oceans are parted, flaming shrubbery starts yelling at dudes and, in what is one of many disturbingly phallic metaphors littered throughout the book, Moses and the Pharaoh's magicians start slinging about their \"snakes\" and \"staffs\" to see whose is bigger. It's all quite exciting and imaginative, but it feels kind of like a bait and switch: We came into Moses' story reading The Grapes of Wrath, then wham! Moses finds out he's a Jew and everything goes Harry Potter.In all fairness, the Jews are a notoriously magical people.After what seems like 400 years, the Holy Bible finally finishes the setup phase and launches us into the main tale, where we meet our central character for the first time - even though it's still God. Sort of. It gets a little confusing, frankly: Our protagonist, God, is somehow also a character named Jesus Christ, who is the son of God and- listen, it's never quite clear what the genealogy is, or how God is his own son or anything (and what's up with the ghost?) but a lot of the set-up just has to be taken on faith. Now, the character of Jesus may not be the most original creation (he's kind of amalgam of three other prominent protagonists: The \"awakened man\" complex, like Neo from the Matrix; a bit of Superman's down home heroics; and an oddly compelling dash of Timothy Leary's \"freaking out the squares\" mentality) but he's oddly endearing nonetheless.And it's a good thing Jesus is such a likable protagonist, because his cast of supporting characters seems utterly disposable at times. No sooner are you introduced to an intriguing new character than the author brutally murders them in some bizarre fashion, for no real reason and often with little to no impact on the story itself. The character of John the Baptist, for example, was a personal favorite of mine. He read like a kind of gruff bearish figure (I mentally cast him as John Goodman) and his presence lent the book an almost whimsical twist. But just as I was getting attached to him, the author has him beheaded almost as a footnote!This is all we John the Baptist fans get for a death scene: \"And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.\"One sentence!The Holy Bible kills off supporting characters like horror movies kill black people. Listen, I know that was kind of a spoiler, but it's quite hard to review a book like this without spoiling something: The plot twists, turns, snakes and gyrates like Axl Rose on ecstasy. John's death was a minor spoiler, but there are some big ones I'm avoiding here (hint: Watch for Zombies!). So, without going further into details that might spoil the work, just know that The Holy Bible is a rompin' stompin' fantasy adventure full of subtle morality and intricate allegory the likes of which we haven't seen since The Lord of the Rings trilogy.Really, there are only a few criticisms I have: The sections where the author obviously forces their own political agenda into the story are rather distracting (at one point the whole story grinds to a halt so the Jesus character can give some sort of \"sermon\" on this \"mount\"-like thing that is little more than liberal propaganda extolling the benefits of a welfare state) and at times it seems like it could've used an editor with a heavier hand (1100 pages long?! Who do you think you are, David Foster Wallace?). I must say that overall, the Holy Bible is a story everybody should read at least once. Just keep in mind that though this may seem like your run of the mill fantasy adventure, there are a myriad of vicious maulings, explicit torture scenes, rape and prostitution, so it's definitely not for children!Oh, and though there are some hints of a sequel (a Second Coming is mentioned a few times), I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you - no official deals have been signed at this time.So, in summation, I'd give the Holy Bible four out of five.",

I will second the previous reviewer's issues with navigation, it is difficult to navigate with. I did a short test and timed myself with a paper-based Bible and the ESV on the Kindle. It took me about 5-6 seconds to look up most verses with the paper-based Bible and about 20-25 seconds on the Kindle. Nerdy, I know, but it is a good way to reference this Bible. This is more of a Kindle hardware/software issue though and not necessarily anything to fault Crossway's ESV Bible though.I think the key to fixing this issue involves a combination of Bible publishers and Kindle software designers help. You need to be able to have the ability to search only within the book currently being read so that when I run a search it will not attempt to search all books (which is slower than searching a single book). The ability to jump immediately to the pages that contain the text I searched for rather than having to select the result from the \"search results preview screen\" would be good as well. Also, the Bible publishers need to have the commonly searchable names for the books of the Bible in the text so that when I search for Lam 1 I will get Lamentations 1 without having to type in Lamentations, which can take a while to type in. I know this is just partial-text searching, but that doesn't seem to function properly with the current Kindle software release (1.0 121380292 still, I haven't received 1.0.4). It also might be good for the Kindle to have the ability to search through \"hidden\" text. Maybe a tag could be wrapped around text that you'd like to search for but would not display while reading, this way I could search for \"Psa 119:129\" and I could jump directly there because this verse would have \"Psa Psalm 119:129\" in meta-text that is searchable but is not displayed.I know we're only talking a few seconds to navigate, but when you are doing any kind of in-depth Bible study or if you have a pastor/preacher/teacher that likes to jump around the Bible a lot, this is actually pretty important. [...].In summary, I would recommend this version. It might be nice to see cross-references or some of the other ESV editions that Crossway publishes (Literary Study Bible!) in the future but I'm sure these will come as the Kindle catches on.",

While the text, references, footnotes, maps, and concordance are identical to the already published Classic Reference Bible, there are, in my opinion, three unique improvements in this edition that commend it to anyone who loves and prefers this wonderful translation:(1) The print type is larger, a 10.5 size (vs 9.5 in the original Classic Reference), which makes it easier to read. This is especially true with regards to the references and footnotes, which were practically illegible to my 40+ year old eyes.(2) The wider margins allow notetaking, a real plus.(3) While I don't claim to be a binding expert, it does appear that the binding used (at least on the genuine leather edition) is of a higher quality than on the original edition, which is a much needed improvement.In summary, I would commend this edition of the ESV without qualification, unlike the earlier editions.",

Yesterday after only 90+ days use, the spine SPLIT. I can identify about four additional places that will also split in a matter of weeks. Also, the edges are worn down.

The \"Journalling Bible\" was not it (the type was too small and thus the space for notes on each verse was limited). The \"Deluxe Reference Bible\" came close, but had margins that were just a bit miserly.The \"ESV Single Column Reference Bible\" is an excellent bible for study. The ESV translation is one of the best, and the page arrangement of this version is ideal for taking notes (and there is some room for adding to the cross-references, if one desires to do so).The TruTone cover is a nice artificial calfskin; it is so supple and soft that you will feel decadent. Two buddies who borrowed or handled mine actually commented that they wished they could afford such a nice Bible. I didn't get it to induce covetousness, but it is nice to know that SOMETHING I own might be droolworthy.This is a fine Bible, but not perfect.The \"Single Column Reference Bible\" is just two strokes off par. These have been mentioned by others, but I think deserve acknowledgment:First and foremost, the pages are indeed thin. One particular example of this is that the bleed-through of printing from the back of each page actually is as dark as the (gray) paragraph marks on the page one is reading. I have had Bibles that had thinner pages, and one can adapt to them. Still, I am approaching the age at which I appreciate any eyesight help that I can get.In addition, the type is a bit harder to read than that of the \"Deluxe Reference Bible,\" being both smaller and less heavy.Had this Bible used the paper of the \"Deluxe Reference Bible,\" I think I would have little to criticize (except, of course, the unwieldly thickness it would then possess).As it is, I find myself using this Bible quite often for casual verse look-up, and generally carry it to church and bible study. The note-taking space seems to be most important to me in those venues. For most reading and at-home study, I still prefer the \"ESV Deluxe Reference Bible.\"If you really want a Bible with room to make plenty of lengthy notes, the Single Column Reference Bible will probably be satisfactory. However if you can get by with modest note-taking space, or if bleed-through from other pages really reduces readability for you, then you would probably prefer the \"Deluxe Reference\" over the \"Single-Column Reference.\"By the way, for any Bible (including this one) that has enough bleed-through to be annoying, you might find it useful to keep a couple of sheets of black paper tucked inside the Bible. If you put one of these behind the page you are reading, the print from the backside is much less noticeable (although the whole page will sort of look gray).",

The reader may want a Bible that gives the interpretation of a passage (regardless of the passage's literal language); or, the reader may want the Bible to translate the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic accurately, and to make up his or her own mind about the passage's meaning. One reader may be distressed if language favors the male gender; another reader may be distressed if the publisher changes the Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic canon text to make language more gender-neutral.This review assumes the reader wants an Updated NASB Bible. The Updated NASB Bible: (i) translates the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic literally; and (ii) follows the canon text with respect to gender. If the reader wants a Bible that gives a passage's interpretation, rather than the passage's literal translation, that reader may be happier with a Message Bible (or similar Bible), which gives a modern paraphrase of the literal translation. If the reader wants gender-neutral language, the reader may be happier with a New Revised Standard Version, which uses inclusive pronouns.First, the pluses of the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible.This Bible is beautiful. The leather is of excellent quality. The gold leaf is flawless. The pages are neatly-arranged, and the arrangement renders the Bible very user-friendly. The print is somewhat larger than the print of competing study Bibles, making the Scofield Bible more convenient for those with poor eyesight.Second, the minuses.Where New Testament language quotes a passage from the Old Testament, the NASB translation emphasizes the reference by using a different typeface: small capitalized letters. This is an excellent feature. However, inexplicably, Scofield rarely identifies the Old Testament passage that is being quoted. The reader is left frustrated, knowing that the small-caps language quotes an Old Testament passage, but with no convenient way to locate the passage being quoted (forcing the reader to do what I am doing: have both a Scofield Study Bible and a Zondervan Study Bible in front of him or her, and read the two together-a time-consuming, bulky, and expensive method that calls into question the rationale for buying the Scofield Bible in the first place).Also, the quality of Scofield's footnotes varies wildly. I bought the Scofield Bible because I compared its notes on one particular topic with the notes of competing Bibles, and found Scofield's notes to be more helpful than the others. I assumed that Scofield's superiority on that one topic would carry through the rest of the Scofield Bible.That assumption was incorrect.Some text that desperately needs extensive footnoting has little or none (which is probably how Scofield could produce a study Bible about the same size as a comparable Zondervan Study Bible but with larger print). As one example, Scofield has four notes in Mark explaining the Olivet Discourse; Zondervan has 29.Some notes are poorly-written. As one example, the note describing Judas Iscariot in connection with Matthew 26:14 says Judas was \"One of the twelve disciples of Jesus who betrayed Him.\" The note implies that there were more than 12 disciples, 12 disciples betrayed Jesus, and Judas was one of the 12 who betrayed Him. The note should read (simply to be grammatically correct, and without regard to the additional information the note would need in order to be more nearly accurate and complete), \"One of the 12 disciples of Jesus; the disciple who betrayed Him.\"Some footnotes contain interpretations that are simply incorrect. As one example, recall the Parable of the Landowner. In that parable, a landowner walls off his property, installs a grape press, and leases the property to vine-growers. The landowner sends a slave to collect the rents; the vine-growers beat him and send him on his way, empty-handed. The same scene is repeated multiple times; the vine-growers beat some of the slaves, and kill others. Finally, the landowner sends his son. The vine-growers kill the son. Plainly, the landowner in the parable is God. The slaves are the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist. The landowner's son is Jesus. The vine-growers are the Pharisees (and presumably the Sadducees and Herodians). But, the note to Mark 12:1 maintains that \"the vine-growers . . . are the O.T. prophets and John the Baptist.\" I.e., according to the note, the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist-not the Pharisees (and Sadducees and Herodians)-persecuted Jesus and caused him to be crucified.Scofield's sloppiness and errors, such as those described in the examples above, render its notes on less-clear parables, discourses, and other material highly suspect.In short, while the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible may have some usefulness in one's library, and is certainly beautiful, the serious student would be better off buying a Bible with better references, more notes, and better note scholarship._______________",

                "review/text": "First let me say that if you don't like the NASB you are entitled to that opinion. Don't buy this Bible or any other using this version.If you like the NASB or if you want to try one of the better \"modern\" translations then this is an excellent investment. The quality of construction is outstanding. Oxford has done a great job in this regard.For those looking for a comprehensive \"Study Bible\" let me advise you to try another. For me, the Scofield is a \"reference\" Bible. The notes have more to do with CI Scofield advancing his ideas about dispensationalism. There are many notes related to prophecy because of this and you will find them pretty much in keeping with the current views among evangelicals of the pre-trib camp. Still the notes can be sparse. If verse explanations and background is what you are looking for this is not the Bible for you.If you want a more thorough Study Bible in this particular translation I would recommend the NASB Study Bible by Zondervan (using the same notes from the NIV Study Bible).The advantage to the Scofield in general is the way that the text is layed out. The outlining with the headings (and subheadings) within the text is unparalleled. The topical and cross reference system is also top notch. The indexes to notes and subjects in the back are very helpful.The Scofield has been a mainstay in evangelical Christianity for 100 years because of the insight of CI Scofield that has helped many to understand God's plan through the ages and the overall excellence of Oxford in producing these Bibles. It takes its place right alongside the Thompson Chain as one of the great Bibles of the last century.",

                "review/text": "I purchased The Scofield Study Bible III: New American Standard Bible, in Burgundy Genuine Leather. After having used the New Scofield for 32 years, in many ways, this Bible is an improvement. Below are outlined the improvements that I have found in this edition:1. The major weakness of the Scofields of the past has been their reliance upon the King James Version, which is now 400 years old. With this NASB edition, the translation itself is no longer an issue.2. Another problem with previous editions of the Scofields was their binding-which invariably broke under time. This one appears to have a much stronger binding than those previously-issued. The burgundy pigskin cover is stunning in its appearance.3. The layout and overall appearance of the pages themselves is much cleaner and much more appealing-especially with the use of boxes around the summary footnotes for each major doctrine.4. Cross-references are easier to locate in the margins. I'm thankful that the Lockman Foundation allowed Oxford to use their own Scofield cross-referencing system without the clutter that the addition of the NASB references would have caused.5. The Concordance is in a 3-column-per-page format and is a healthy 132 pages long.6. Book introductions and outlines have been expanded and are more detailed.7. And, the Index Of Proper Names from the Old Scofield has been retained. This index gives the meaning, pronunciation, and location for all proper names found in Scripture.I have two criticisms of this Bible:1. While the New Scofield was jam-packed with footnotes, this edition has had some of those footnotes edited out, so they are fewer in number than those found in the New Scofield.2. For the life of me, I do not understand why Oxford issued this as a \"Red-Letter\" edition, with the words of Christ in red. I find it hard to take any study Bible with red letters seriously. It was a needless and most-unwanted addition.At $34.64, this Bible is a best-buy-the best of the Scofield Bibles of the past based upon a much better translation, a much-more appealing page format, and in a stronger binding.",

This process is often referred to as \"smyth-sewn\" and ensures that this Bible will stand up to years of use and study. (Thomas Nelson and Zondervan cheaply glue single pages onto a flimsy cardboard backing. This ensures that your Bible pages will fall out after even moderate use of your scriptures.)2) The quality of paper is also excellent and will stand up to prolonged use. The paper is a pleasing white and is supple and flexible to the touch. (The inferior paper used by most American Bible publishers is prone to tearing and discoloration).3) The quality of the Leather cover is also good and is sturdy while still being flexible (Genuine Leather). It should break in nicely over the years. The information that came with my Bible said they use either pigskin or cow hide.4) The Scofield study notes consist of book outlines, chapter headings, in-text maps, verse explanations, and verse chain references. The balance between text and commentary is about 60/40. Those of you used to the Macarthur Study Bible may be a bit disappointed.I also recommend: Scofield III ESV (English Standard Version)Scofield III NKJVScofield III KJVI do not recommend the Scofield III HCSB (Holman Christian Standard Bible) The translation is too watered down like the NIV.

I will go with them. Anyway, onward and upward...the NASB Scofield is here, as a continuation of Oxford's augmenting of the original Scofield Bible, the 'original' of which(1917) has a cult-following among Independent, fundamental Baptists. So far, the Bible has been printed in KJV, NKJV, NIV, NAS, ESV, and the HCSB will be out in 2007( Note, March, 2007: the HCSB Scofield is out an in stores---all thumb indexed. :-( ). Oxford has done a monumental job, in my opinion, providing a great reference Bible in all the popular translations. I am reviewing the NASB Scofield in Burgundy genuine leather, which is a royal red Berkshire leather, very handsome, and a beautiful shade of darkish-red. Oxford Bibles are smyth-sewn, and will last. They are printed in Korea, and the Koreans only sew the bindings. The print is 9-point and nice. My only gripe with the print is the horrendous shade of red used in the New Testament---it is fire-engine red and hard to read. Eye doctors will tell you that red print is NOT good on the eyes, and I believe it. Oxford has withdrawn the NKJV Scofield Black Letter Bible, unfortunately. Anyway, these new Scofields greatly augment the original Scofield notes with needed charts, intext maps, and helps from soup to nuts. This is a Bible worth having in a very good, formal-equivalence translation. It is a quality product---won't fall apart on you and the bindings won't crack. This is a good investment, and an excellent tool to study the Word.",

                "review/text": "At the outset, recognize that different readers want different Bibles. E.g., a reader may want a coffee-table Bible, a devotional Bible, or a study Bible. The reader may want a Bible that gives the interpretation of a passage (regardless of the passage's literal language); or, the reader may want the Bible to translate the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic accurately, and to make up his or her own mind about the passage's meaning. One reader may be distressed if language favors the male gender; another reader may be distressed if the publisher changes the Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic canon text to make language more gender-neutral.This review assumes the reader wants an Updated NASB Bible. The Updated NASB Bible: (i) translates the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic literally; and (ii) follows the canon text with respect to gender. If the reader wants a Bible that gives a passage's interpretation, rather than the passage's literal translation, that reader may be happier with a Message Bible (or similar Bible), which gives a modern paraphrase of the literal translation. If the reader wants gender-neutral language, the reader may be happier with a New Revised Standard Version, which uses inclusive pronouns.First, the pluses of the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible.This Bible is beautiful. The leather is of excellent quality. The gold leaf is flawless. The pages are neatly-arranged, and the arrangement renders the Bible very user-friendly. The print is somewhat larger than the print of competing study Bibles, making the Scofield Bible more convenient for those with poor eyesight.Second, the minuses.Where New Testament language quotes a passage from the Old Testament, the NASB translation emphasizes the reference by using a different typeface: small capitalized letters. This is an excellent feature. However, inexplicably, Scofield rarely identifies the Old Testament passage that is being quoted. The reader is left frustrated, knowing that the small-caps language quotes an Old Testament passage, but with no convenient way to locate the passage being quoted (forcing the reader to do what I am doing: have both a Scofield Study Bible and a Zondervan Study Bible in front of him or her, and read the two together-a time-consuming, bulky, and expensive method that calls into question the rationale for buying the Scofield Bible in the first place).Also, the quality of Scofield's footnotes varies wildly. I bought the Scofield Bible because I compared its notes on one particular topic with the notes of competing Bibles, and found Scofield's notes to be more helpful than the others. I assumed that Scofield's superiority on that one topic would carry through the rest of the Scofield Bible.That assumption was incorrect.Some text that desperately needs extensive footnoting has little or none (which is probably how Scofield could produce a study Bible about the same size as a comparable Zondervan Study Bible but with larger print). As one example, Scofield has four notes in Mark explaining the Olivet Discourse; Zondervan has 29.Some notes are poorly-written. As one example, the note describing Judas Iscariot in connection with Matthew 26:14 says Judas was \"One of the twelve disciples of Jesus who betrayed Him.\" The note implies that there were more than 12 disciples, 12 disciples betrayed Jesus, and Judas was one of the 12 who betrayed Him. The note should read (simply to be grammatically correct, and without regard to the additional information the note would need in order to be more nearly accurate and complete), \"One of the 12 disciples of Jesus; the disciple who betrayed Him.\"Some footnotes contain interpretations that are simply incorrect. As one example, recall the Parable of the Landowner. In that parable, a landowner walls off his property, installs a grape press, and leases the property to vine-growers. The landowner sends a slave to collect the rents; the vine-growers beat him and send him on his way, empty-handed. The same scene is repeated multiple times; the vine-growers beat some of the slaves, and kill others. Finally, the landowner sends his son. The vine-growers kill the son. Plainly, the landowner in the parable is God. The slaves are the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist. The landowner's son is Jesus. The vine-growers are the Pharisees (and presumably the Sadducees and Herodians). But, the note to Mark 12:1 maintains that \"the vine-growers . . . are the O.T. prophets and John the Baptist.\" I.e., according to the note, the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist-not the Pharisees (and Sadducees and Herodians)-persecuted Jesus and caused him to be crucified.Scofield's sloppiness and errors, such as those described in the examples above, render its notes on less-clear parables, discourses, and other material highly suspect.In short, while the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible may have some usefulness in one's library, and is certainly beautiful, the serious student would be better off buying a Bible with better references, more notes, and better note scholarship._______________",

                "review/text": "As any true student of the Bible knows, the languages of the Bible cannot be perfectly translated \"word for word\" into English. Additionally, just as in English a word may have various definitions based on the context, the same is true with Greek and Hebrew. Many schollars agree that the NASB is about as close as one can come to a true word for word translation. Having a good word for word translation of the Bible is essential for any serious Bible sudent.The causual reader will find this translation very easy to read, using modern English, but should have the understanding that there are a few passages where the full intent of the writer could not be fully expressed. Additionally, beacuase some words may have more than one possible definition, disagreement exists as to what the writer may have intended to say in a few passages. None of this changes the over all message of the Bible.If one wants to unlock some of the deeper meanings of the orginal languages, they should invest in a good Greek and Hebrew concordance as well, such as Strongs Exhaustive Concordance. You can even get a copy of the NASB with Stongs numbers. Vines Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words is also a good book to have.Any Bible claiming to be a 'traslation' that does not follow 'word for word', is really not a translation at all, but a paraphrase.The best paraphase Bible that you can get would be the Amplified Bible by the Lockman Foudnation which clearly marks words that have been added, (not translated), as well as alternate readings of the origninal languges in order to assist the reader in understanding the original writers full intent.Scofields notes present a popular premillennial view of Biblical prophecy which most evangelicals hold to be the correct view. That said, I have yet to find two students of the Bible who agree 100% with everything Scofield wrote.Other popular study Bibles go way over the top on their commentary and references making them hard to read. If I want a commentary, I'll by a commentary. When I sit down to read the Bible, I want to read the Bible. Scofield provides just enough notes and references to provide a better degree of clarity, without filling half of each page with commentary. That's why this reference Bible has remained so popular for so many years.All things considered, and many would agree, this is the best study Bible you can get.This Bible is bound with bonded leather, while not as good as genuine leather, is also much less expensive and is quite durable.",

                "review/text": "There is not an English Bible that will bring you closer to the full historical, literary, and religious meaning of the Bible than this one--and I've looked at all the competition up close. The format of the full edition is great, and for most people, this is the only Bible you'll ever need. The translation (made not from French, as some persist in saying, but from the Hebrew and Greek) is faithful without being awkward or obscure, and fluent without being fuzzy (NEB/REB, anyone?) or inaccurate. The scholarly apparatus (especially the footnotes, also the marginal parallel passages, introductions, and indices in the back to places, persons, and major footnotes) is outstanding. Only the Oxford Annotated can compete, and, again and again, I have found that the Oxford editors are guilty of tedious plot summary, while the NJB actually gives historical, cultural, and textual information that deepens your understanding of the text! I am a scholar, not a Roman Catholic, and moments where I think \"Catholic\" reading a note are EXTREMELY rare. This is not a Catholic Bible, this is a Bible for whoever wants the most objective, historically sound, and readable presentation of the original texts. The way I think, if you're going to read books that are millennia old, you need HELP. It's all here, the perfect marriage of readability (much better on this score than NRSV) and accuracy (arguably the best here too, though of course preferences in this domain are controversial).Don't be misled by the half-truth that this literarily distinguished translation is somehow \"looser\" than, say, the NRSV (which, in the New Oxford Annotated Bible, is probably the NJB's only real competition). The NRSV, in the tradition of the KJV, still tilts towards word-for-word translations even when they don't give a clear and accurate sense of what the original text means. Not only is this not ideal for general readers, who will blame themselves for not understanding what the hyper-literal rendition has obscured, but it is not very helpful for more scholarly readers who too often will only see the impenetrability of the original reproduced in English. The fact is, that centuries of scholarship have given us a good understanding of most of these difficult passages. The NJB does the favor of bringing out these accurate understandings in translation; and when it really IS obscure, it explains the difficulty in a note! I have often had the experience of reading the translation of a passage I've studied closely, and thinking \"Aha! of COURSE that's the correct nuance that didn't come through in my own clunky 'literal' attempt to read the original correctly.\"In all fairness, some criticisms/clarifications. Some have expressed concern that this translation's intention to be \"inclusive\" has led to departures from the original texts' true meaning. In general, this is not a problem with the NJB. For example, in reading 1300 pp. of the Hebrew Bible, I found the translators' choices to be guided by accuracy and fidelity. (Non-philologists often don't realize that the ancient languages have loads of ways of making gender-non-specific constructions; the problem has often been to get it into modern English!) But there was one howler. In the decalogue, we read \"set your heart on your neighbor's spouse.\" This is a bit of a stretch from the Hebrew \"your neighbor's woman [wife].\" I think the great fame of the Ten Commandments as \"universal\" principles clouded the translators' judgments here. A more frequent but minor irritation is that the translators have violated good English usage in writing \"the wise\" to mean \"the wise one\" (singular). They thought it was less awkward (and they are right to avoid the inaccurate \"man\"), but they judged wrong--it's just not good English to use \"the wise\" with a singular verb. One more complaint. As other reviewers have said, the superior notes (for which you have to buy the full edition, ISBN 0385142641) are one of the biggest reasons to use the NJB. But if you are reading whole books of the Bible at once, you will probably feel some annoyance that the explanatory notes are mixed in with the textual notes. In other words, when you see that a verse has a footnote, you don't know (without reading it) whether it has to do with a minor and uninteresting textual variation in one of the traditions, or whether it is one of the NJB's fantastic notes that contextualize the passage, give a thought-provoking reference to elsewhere, etc. In this regard, the design of Oxford study Bibles (where the two kinds of notes are segregated, though there's no marker in the text that there is an explanatory note, as there is in NJB) is probably superior. In most books, it doesn't matter, but there are some where the textual tradition is so messy that you really get tired of looking at the bottom of the page, and it disrupts the reading experience even for a reader who enjoys a complicated and scholarly view of the Bible.To me, it speaks volumes that the problems I've mentioned (one howler + occasional infelicity + design error of the notes) don't change the fact that this is the most accurate, fluent, and useful-for-study-purposes Bible in existence!",

Although a product of top notch Catholic scholarship, all Christians- Anglican, Orthodox, mainline Protestants and Evangelicals may enjoy this beautiful version. More literal than its parent, the original Jerusalem Bible of 1966, it is still more free than the NRSV and is very graceful and eloquent in speech. Psalm 23 is particularly lovely. The New Jerusalem Bible also has one of the best renderings of the classic Ephesians 2:8-10 text, rendering verse 10 &quot;we are God's work of art...&quot; I appreciate that the NJB renders the Pauline use of the &quot;flesh&quot; variously as &quot;disordered desire,&quot; &quot;weakness of human nature&quot; &quot;natural inclinations&quot; depending on the context. This is much more clear than translating &quot;flesh,&quot; which can lead to the misconception that the body is the seat of evil. Rather, as the translation &quot;disordered desires&quot; indicates, Paul is talking about normal, natural human desires that are disordered and dysfunctional. This approach is much to be preferred over the New International Version's very awkward and disappointing translation, &quot;sinful nature&quot; in almost every place where Paul use &quot;flesh (GK, sarx).&quot; The only possible drawback is that the use of &quot;Yahweh&quot; to translate the divine name may be offensive to some of our Jewish brothers and sisters. Many readers do enjoy the use of Yahweh. I also would have liked to see the Reader's Edition use single column like the original Jerusalem Bible, which has been recently republished. The New Jerusalem bible is one of the very best translations available today, in my mind second only to the NRSV. I only wish it was a little more popular, I think many Christians are missing the boat by not owning this wonderful Bible. I am disappointed that my own Roman Catholic Church in America does not use this Catholic translation more in the liturgy- the language of the New Jerusalem Bible sings.",

This is simply to be faithful to the original. Modern Jews and Christians avoid taking the name of God (&quot;Yahweh&quot;) in vain by never taking it at all, but this tradition had not yet developed when most of the OT was written. In fact, many Israelites were polytheists at the time, so that the scribes had to make it quite clear which God they were referring to. Other terms left untranslated &quot;Yahweh Sabaoth&quot; (or God of Armies?) and &quot;El Shaddai&quot;The OT in general is a bit surprising. Most Christian translators, following the logic in Galatians and Hebrews, view vast tracts of the Old Testament as simply prefiguring the new, and this tends to affect their translation and commentary. Here the only concern is to as faithfully as possible try to represent what the original writers wanted to say. Whether or not the old testament prefigures the new is left to the reader.The notes and introductions are excellent, frankly presenting the consensus opinions of modern historians even when they go against church tradition. For example, we are told that the Song of Songs was originally a secular love-song, but that Church tradition has come to view it differently. Also, we are told that Daniel (also several other books, like Judith,Tobit,Esther) is a work of fiction.",

While the New American Bible version is the most popular Catholic Bible in the US, the New Jerusalem Bible is the preferred translation with the worldwide Catholic (no redundancy here) following (used during liturgy and personal study) and also popular with the Anglican and Orthodox Christians.This New version is translated directly from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts with the scholarship skill reflecting the research, study, and translation of its 1966 published predecesor - the Jerusalem Bible.The Old Testament has introduction notes to its four main sections: The Pentateuch (the first 5 books; Mosaic texts), The Historical Books, The Wisdom Books, and The Prophets. The New Testament has introduction nots to the Synoptic Gospels (St. Matthew, Mark and Luke), Gospel and Letter of John, Acts of the Apostles, The Letters of Paul (pastoral epistles/letters), The Letters to All Christians (catholic/universal epistles/letters). The Supplemental notes include a Chronologic Table, charts and calendars, an Alphabetical table of the Major Footnotes, an Index of Persons (a great feature), and some great Color Maps.With the claim that J.R.R. Tolkien was one of the original translators and that this edition targets \"the Christian and non-Christian, believer and skeptic audiences, and anyone who wishes to own a Bible independent of sectarian and confessional considerations\" it would seem to be the ideal Bible to own. A note on this marketing strategy is that this version includes the Apocrypha (Old Testament Deutero-canonical books), and explanatory footnotes which are non-polemical but from a Catholic/Anglican theological perspective.What I like most about this Bible is is literary quality. Verses flow easily without numbering interruptions and the text really reads like the original recipients (e.g. the churches in Asia Minor) would have read it ... as a letter. The textual presentation is truly literary, such that poetical, liturgical, and prayers that Paul writes in his letters are formated uniquely and separately. The same is the case with the Psalms and Gospels. The verse numbers are listed to the right of the text, and verse separation is denoted by a dot (it was only in the 13th century when the original texts were numbered and divided into verses and subtitles added for ease of reference).As an evangelical Protestant, I am using this guide as a more comprehensive view of textual and historical hermeneutics, and a more reader-friendly textual literary format.THANK YOU for your VOTES (up or down)!",

They are thorough, critical, scholarly, and firmly grounded in the Catholic tradition without surrendering too much to current liberal protestant scholarship.The translation is good, readable, and elegant. However, the use of inclusive language is questionable (though it is not as excessive as the NRSV) and also the use of &quot;Yaweh&quot; instead up substituting &quot;Adonai&quot; for the divine name is potentially offensive to Jewish readers and hinders some of the eloquence of the Old Testament readings. I highly recommend this Bible to be used with the New Oxford Annotated Bible (Revised Standard Version, NOT the NRSV).",

                "review/text": "To understand the NJB you need to learn about the JB first. No other bible can be compared to the quality and accuracy of The Jerusalem Bible (1966). It is approved for liturgical use in Europe by the Vatican. That makes it an official Catholic bible. With relaxations of the official church position on bible translations, Alexander Jones of Christ's College, Liverpool took the opportunity as an editor to guide a team of translators in an English language translation of the Holy Bible using a method already accomplished by the Dominican Biblical School in Jerusalem with their production of La Bible de J&eacute;rusalem (1956) in French, by means of Hebrew and Greek sources while bypassing the Latin Vulgate (the key reason why the Catholic Church thought long and hard about approving this process). Thus the English version of the JB is not French to English translation as some have erroneously suggested. Along with creating the JB the editors also historically researched each book of the bible, and prepared an introduction for most books along with creating sets of footnotes that would cross-reference the entire bible. The Old Testament sources are the Masoretic texts, with a critical inspection comparison using the Greek Septuagint (the LXX). Since the Dead Sea Scrolls mostly matched the LXX, the JB happens to be the most accurate rendition of the OT. It is even better than the Jewish Tanakh and the Masoretic texts themselves that are not always in line with the Dead Sea Scrolls. The critical combination of the LXX and the Masoretic texts produce a version of the Old Testament of the quality used by Jews and certainly the apostles, at the time of Christ. The inclusion of all the books of the OT, including the `controversial' books erroneously labelled the `apocrypha' by Martin Luther during the reformation, is made on the bases that they are in the LXX (200 BC), the Vulgate (400 AD) and that the removal of them from the OT is a post-crucifixion event by Jews at Jamnia (Council of Jamnia) in 90 AD, again by Martin Luther in the Luther's bible of 1534 before finally being removed altogether by Protestant book publishers between 1825-27 after the Edinburgh Committee of the British and Foreign Bible Society decided simply not to print them anymore. Only the Catholic Church has regarded them as Old Testament with the Dead Sea Scrolls confirming this position (and it is not as if anyone had the right to canonize any other version of the bible after the Catholic Church did it at the Third Council of Carthage in 397 AD). Here they are again, and yes they do include the Books of Maccabees with `prayers for the dead' in tact. The English writer J.R.R. Tolkien has his hand in the style of writing and we even have the insertion of the name \"Yahweh\" (I AM WHO I AM) for God in reading the Old Testament. The JB (1966) was written before the advent of inclusive language (something that the church believes alters the word of God) so we also have the added bonus of having this fantastic translation without the use of inclusive language. Since it is modern (note, not modernism) you can read it without having to study Shakespeare (as readers of the King James Bible would have to do, resulting in many doctrinal errors also) and come away with a fresh and accurate understanding of the Sacred Scriptures by only reading it once (slowly though I might add), still there is nothing like it in terms of quality, ease of use and correctness. Alexander Jones, who obviously had a firm understanding of what went wrong with other bible translations, has done what all others have failed to do. There are some very minor quibbles about its use of short text in some passages of the NT and so the JB was revised in 1985 by Henry Wansbrough and the new version was called The New Jerusalem Bible (NJB) but was rejected by the Holy See for its use of inclusive language (still the NJB is an amazing bible, but not for liturgical use). Even though the publication of the NJB was not approved, the NJB was widely circulated and had an impact on the JB to the point of putting it out of print. However recent demand for the originally approved JB has brought it back into circulation again, only not without what might be considered a shortcoming. Unlike the perfect print and typeset of the NJB all versions of the JB are photocopies of the 1966 version and have not been typeset again. Don't be disappointed to find the odd photocopied hair appearing across the page of a JB. However this is only cribbing, the text still looks as good as most bibles, just not as perfect as the NJB, and the fact that the JB has never been typeset means that you can not get a digital version of the JB, unlike the NJB that has been reproduced for bible study software packages. You can only own the JB on the printed page. The fact that the JB is not in digital has its disadvantages for serious bible scholars who like to run word searches, so in this case a digital NJB is highly recommended, but at the same time this means that the JB can only be read in the way it was presented, on the printed page, in a bound hardcover book, and this is precisely how the JB should be read, and precisely how sacred scripture should be presented. You can read the NJB in the same way by choosing the hardback version. The numbering system seems to disappear at times within the text, but this is in fact a method used by the JB to keep the original flow of sacred scripture. Sometimes the chapter number system actually broke the text in places where it should not have been, a bad tradition continued today because of this numbering system. Thus you will be reading chapters only to discover a small 5 instead of a big 5 like the 4 before it and the 6 after it. This method keeps the original chapter breaks of the books of bible that have long been lost to the numbering system. You have never read a bible like this one before. Quite simply I would deeply consider shelving all other bibles that you have and also getting a JB as your core official bible and using this NJB for any quick double-checks that need to be made. Citing from the JB shows that you have (1) Understood the acumen involved in its translation, (2) a desire to ensure that everyone who doesn't speak Shakespeare can comprehend you and the Word of God and (3) want to keep the Canon of books that Christ and the Apostles used that was canonized at the Third Council of Carthage, (4) want to use an officially approved bible (something that the NJB is not, but it is still very high quality all the same.) Reading the JB or the NJB is a miracle in itself. Never has our Justification through Faith in Jesus Christ because his forgiveness for our Sins by way of the Cross and Resurrection of the Body been made so absolute in print.*Note: Personally I own a full size JB hardback and a mini zipper bible version of the NJB (You will find it if you look for other Henry Wansbrough editions of the NJB). This means I can take the NJB with me to church or places in my pocket. The JB is kept as a full size bible and is certainly the more authoritative of the two because of its liturgical usage. I know this does have an impact on those who came here to buy a NJB, but the JB is the one officially approved by the Holy See, not the NJB. However that does not mean that the NJB is not a good bible, it is, extremely so.)",

                "review/text": "How fortunate that this wonderful translation is still in print. After nearly 40 years, the Jerusalem Bible in English is still as exciting and fresh as when it first appeared in 1966. At the time, it heralded an entirely new approach to the Scriptures. It was the first translation by Catholic scholars to use the original languages rather than the Latin Vulgate. It was translated into modern English. It was the only version to break with King James tradition and spell out the divine name (Yahweh). Despite being the work of French Dominicans, the annotations were non-doctrinal and acclaimed by scholars of all faiths.How disingenuous to the original spirit, therefore, that the back cover proclaims that &quot;it still holds to the traditional (noninclusive) language that appeals to conservative Catholic and Protestant Christians.&quot; It was not the specific intention of the editors and translators to produce a Bible described like that. Gender inclusive language was not even an issue at that time. If the Jerusalem Bible lacks gender inclusive language, it's due to its historical dating rather than a deliberate decision taken by its translators. There has also been some writing about how the JB compares to the New Jerusalem Bible (1985) in this regard. While the producers of the NJB acknowledge that they made some very minor changes to accomodate gender neutrality, they are by no means severe. In both the JB and NJB, for example, &quot;brothers&quot; does not become &quot;brothers and sisters&quot; throughout the New Testament (as it does in the NRSV). Also God created &quot;man&quot; in both the JB's and NJB's accounts of Genesis--not &quot;humankind&quot;(as in the NRSV). Gender inclusive language, therefore, does not seem like a significant factor in choosing between the JB and NJB.In other regards, however, there are some differences between the older and newer versions. The NJB, being newer, has the advantage of 20 additional years of scholarship. A lot of new research and discoveries were made in that time that are reflected in the text and notes. (In fact we are probably due for yet another updated English edition soon as there has already been a new French version released in 1997).Other differences between JB and NJB involve personal preferences which can not be objectified. I like the Psalms in the older version (compare Psalm 23: &quot;In meadows of green grass he lets me lie. To the waters of repose he leads me; there he revives my soul.&quot; [JB] with &quot;In grassy meadows he lets me lie. By tranquil streams he leads me to restore my spirit.&quot; [NJB]). On the other hand, I prefer the NJB where Matthew's Beatitudes are &quot;blessed&quot; over the JB where they are merely &quot;happy.&quot;In closing, I would recommend adding the Jerusalem Bible to one's library. Unfortuately this &quot;Reader's Edition&quot; with abridged notes is the only one still in print. The copy that I saw was not as poorly printed and bound as noted by others. It was not, however, as nice as my original 1966 edition. Another reviewer called for republishing the full edition, which I think is a marvelous idea.",

Tolkien was on the committee that worked on this version.This is the original edition and it's becoming harder to find.This is not to be confused with the \"reader's edition\" or New Jerusalem Bible.A few negatives on this Bible:it is cumbersome to carry.It is thick!Approximately 2 3/4 inches thick.And heavy.Now a review of what's inside the covers.My understanding of this version is that it was commissioned by the Catholic Church and it was the first departure from the Latin Vulgate or another words; there was a lot of investigating/studying the Greek and Hebrew texts.This Bible uses the name \"Yahweh\" instead of titles like \"God\" or \"Lord\" in the OT.There are educational Introductions to each book in this Bible.The Jerusalem Bible has 7 more books than the KJV has.They are:1 Maccabees, 2Maccabees, Judith, Tobit, Baruch, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus.The footnotes are exhaustive and very helpful for study.For example a footnote on Isaiah 7:14 describes the subtle difference between Greek and Hebrew for the description of Immanuel's mother as a virgin(Greek) or maiden,young girl,or recently married woman(Hebrew).The JB uses \"maiden\" in that verse where I would argue that it was a prophecy of the \"virgin\" birth.Matthew 6:13 uses the wording \"put us not to the test\" rather than \"lead us not into temptation\"in the Lord's Prayer. This wording is more in line with James 1:13 \"Never, when you have been tempted, say,'God sent the temptation';God cannot be tempted to do anything wrong,and he does not tempt anybody.\"Another curious difference in text wording can be found in Rev.22:19.The KJV and older versions use the words \"book of life\".The Jerusalem Bible(and most modern Bibles) has \"..God will cut off his share of the tree of life and the holy city...\"There is a Chronological Table and Index of Biblical Themes at the end of this book.They are very helpful.The biggest value of the Jerusalem Bible is as a study Bible.The footnotes are excellent!I have found no doctrinal slant or bias in this Bible.It's a classic Bible and getting more difficult to find.It's a keeper in my library!",

Of course, it sat on my shelf for quite some time.Picking it up recently, while working on a project to revise the Breviary of our Synod, I became captivated by the striking language and depth of meaning found in the JB, and decided I needed a slightly better copy for my own use.The Jerusalem Bible is quite simply the most poetic modern english translation of Scriptures that one will find. The depth and clarity with which the Word of God is conveyed within these covers is only rivaled (in places!) by the Revised English Bible's translation of the Duterocanonicals (specifically Ecclesiasticus).Sadly, this hardback 'Reader's Edition' appears to be nothing less than a (crummy) photographic reproduction (and shrunk at that) version of an earlier copy of the Reader's Edition. I am deeply troubled that Doubleday did not see fit to actually imprint this copy of the JB, simply to photocopy/shrink it. (Yes, I know there is more involved than photocopying, but you get my point.)While I highly recommend the Jerusalem Bible (it's my second favorite translation after the English Standard Version), I can't commend this print job.Here's hoping, along with others, that Doubleday might yet get it right.",

They find the text far easier to understand than the New American or the Revised Standard editions. The format is also very user- friendly. Prose passages are typed across the page as in normal books rather than in columns. The psalms, the prophecies and the canticles are indented and given ample white space on the page which not only makes them easier to understand but captures the poetic grandeur of the scripture. Topical headings make individual passages very easy to find without a concordance. All I could wish is that they would re-issue the paperback edition which was available from 1965-mid 80's.

He is the one to whom spoke to Abraham. He is Jesus father, and oh yes his name is in the original Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic; nearly seven thousand times. I have included some prime examples of why this work is so good: on page 385 it says the divine name in Hebrew:Entry: 3068 Yehovah yeh-ho-vaw'; from 1961;(the) self-Existent or Eternal; Jehovah, Jewish national name of God:-- Jehovah, the Lord. Comp. 3050, 3069.Entry: 3069 Yehovih, yeh-ho-vee'; a var. of 3068 [used after 136, and pronounced by Jews as 430 in order to prevent the repetition of the same sound, since they elsewhere pronounce 3068 as 136]:-God.And the entries of 3070, 3071, 3072, 3073, and 3074 (to see what they are you'll have to buy the book.) in which in each instance God's name is correctly translated. Oh... they didn't speak Latin in Bible times. That came only much later after the first council of Nicea. {This period in between these times is commonly known as the \"DARK AGES\" and aptly so.} And by that time much corruption had set into people who professed to revere the Bible. And most educated people realize that by the time Martin Luther came upon the seen... just owning the bible was punishable by death. Furthermore he translated a bible into the people's language himself, in order to help people to get to know the truth about the bible.This work by strong is almost as important, if you are studying the bible closely the truth's contained in the bible are truely evident. Although in honesty this book may be over the heads of some beginners, in which group I consider myself to be only a beginner. And I've studied the bible for 28 years. But just for some of the other beginners who want to know the truth look up Exodus 6:3, Psalms 83:18; Isaiah 12:2; and Isaiah 26:4, and if you have a bible version which doesn't have the divine name there... you should ask yourself why has it been REMOVED?But not to sway anyone personal belief's one way or another, I've spent 5 hours already looking thru this book and find it absolutely incrediable. It is as if God speaks directly to you with no brainwashing if you have this book. On my scale of 1-10 this book if used correctly ranks 777.",

                "review/text": "This publication distills the linguistic essence of the famous exhaustive word concordance of James Strong, listing English words in the Authorised \"King James\" Version of the Bible (A.V.), but, alas, without so indexing and analysing the vocabulary of the A.V. version's Apocrypha (i.e., the deuterocanonical writings of the Old Testament). The A.V.'s English words appear alphabetically arranged in the first section. In second and third sections (for, respectively, the Old Testament and the New Testament) the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek words which the A.V. translated are arrayed numerically by the numbers which Strong assigned to them in his concordance, with Strong's lexical definitions, analyses, and comments.The purpose of this publication, in extracting data from Strong's complete concordance as it does, is fairly well summed up in saying that it presents Strong's lexical and linguistic information and insights (both regarding the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages and the English of the translators of the Authorised \"King James\" Version) apart from all the finding and collocation functions of Strong's full concordance. The book makes a good Strong-lexical supplement even to use with other concordances, whether of the A.V. or of other translations, as well as to use with Strong's own concordance of the A.V. Bible. (The other standard analytical concordance to the A.V. Bible is, of course, Robert Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible, and a fine one to another and, for better and for worse, modern translation is Richard E. Whittaker's The Eerdmans Analytical Concordance to the Revised Standard Version of the Bible.) The paper jacket that enfolds the publication under review here, however, gives a misleading impression of what the book does, which may have aroused hopes in some of its purchasers that use of the book itself dashed, accounting for certain of the negative comments in some other Amazon users' reviews.There has been an \"expanded\" edition of this work, published by T. Nelson in 2001, but, for the most part, its differences derive from also incorporating much (but by no means all) of the information in W. E. Vine's own expository dictionary of Bible vocabulary. The buyer can obtain the original edition of this book based on Strong's work more cheaply, which a serious student of the Holy Scriptures should have in tandem with Vine's own expository dictionary in one of the better and more complete editions of it.This lexical tool, in this original form or as \"expanded\" in the 2001 edition, has somewhat limited utility for the average Bible reader, taken on its own, but it does make for a powerful tool when used with certain reference Bibles that are keyed numerically to Strong. One such, keying to Strong's system what are deemed to be the most important words, is the Hebrew-Greek Key Word Study Bible by Spiros Zodhiates (or Zodiates, as the surname sometimes is spelled), which is available (either for the \"complete\" Protestant Bible, hence without the O.T.'s deuterocanonical writings, or for the New Testament alone) in editions based on a the choice of the A.V. or the New American Standard Version translations, both of which are sufficiently literal translations (the A.V. in Tudor period English, the N.A.S.V. in current English), to be of maximum use in undertaking word studies. However, when choosing an edition of Zodhiates' study Bible, one should bear in mind that the A.V. Bible is based on a superior (\"Byzantine\") Greek text for the N.T., while the deficient and defective underlying Greek of the N.A.S.V.'s N.T. is a form of the so-called \"Critical Text\", with all of its trendy but misleading corruptions which appeal so much to modern but sadly misled scholars.Hendrickson is a publishing house which offers a complete Hebrew-Greek-English Bible in which every single word in the original languages is keyed to Strong's numbers, with two English translations included together, one interlinearly, the other printed aside. Jay P. Green is the editor of this, and it is available in one large single volume or in sets divided into 3 or 4 volumes. One caution is that it is hard to follow the Hebrew O.T. in such an edition, since, of course, Hebrew writing is backwards to what one is accustomed in English, which can make the Hebrew awkward, even downright bewildering, to follow.Green's is even more helpful and exhaustive than Zodiates' study Bible, but the latter is easier to handle physically and is usually sufficient for most needs, though it is nice to have both; in choosing between them, the buyer should decide whether he wants the Strong numbers keyed directly to English words or/and keyed to the words in the original languages with interlinear English directly below.The numerical sections for Hebrew-Aramaic and for Greek words at the back of Zodhiates' and Green's word study Bibles are very compactly printed, hence less easy to read than in the publication under review, and, of course, as they appear in Zodhiates' and Green's publications, they do not benefit from the additional editing of them as available in the product from Thomas Nelson Publishers, under review here.A serious student, whether a layman or an ordained cleric, will want to have every one of the items reviewed or mentioned above. Although all of the authors and editors of these works are Protestants or sectaries, their theological and exegetical stances do not affect too unduly their work in the area of texts and translations, although the buyer of Catholic or Eastern Orthodox persuasion should bear in mind the allegiances of these scholars to their respective theological, exegetical, and/or Millennialist partisanships. A reader whose interest in matters of text and translation is minimal, however, will find that a good edition of Strong's or Young's analytical concordances themselves will meet his needs more satisfactorily.",

Though not incorporated into the final, canonical version of the Hebrew scriptures, it was included in important Bible translations such as the Latin Vulgate and the original King James Version of 1611.

The translators have carefully reviewed words which refer to men only, and, when appropriate, translated them to include all the faithful. For example, when the Apostle Paul addresses the &quot;brothers&quot;, the NRSV substitutes &quot;friends&quot; or &quot;brothers and sisters.&quot; They never tamper with masculine references to God. It is their contention that this slight modification actually makes their translation more accurate. For example, when St. Paul says, &quot;Brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant concerning the resurrection,&quot; this version reminds us that the sisters should also not be ignorant. The complete version with the Apocryphal / Deuterocanonical books contains the fullest collection of books received as sacred Scripture by any historical branch of the Christian Church. By including such difficult-to-find books as 3 Maccabees and Psalm 151, they have produced the only easily obtainable Bible for the whole Church.",

This particular edition differs a bit from other reviews I've read--no portraits, etc.It's an Oxford, so if it were possible for me to have gotten an NRSV with the Apocrypha in genuine black leather from someone else, I'd have done it gladly. Oxford generally cuts corners in the Bible-making process.Because it will be a secondary Bible for me, I'm not terribly peeved about Jesus' words NOT being red, there being no concordance, and there being no dictionary of any kind. The leather is nice but a bit stiff. The spine, however, is sewn and very flexable--a major plus for a long-lasting Bible.I like the fairly handy size very much. Bibles are gennerally made way too big. The paper is very quality and the font selection and paragraph-style page layout is very nice as well.Reguarding the translation itself: I'm particularly pleased with the traslating of the Old Testament and Apocrypha, well done and very readable. I'm not at all offended with the gender-inclusive rendering with certain passages, as footnotes mark each diversion from the originals. When I began reading the Bible, I started with an original Living paraphrase because the KJV was just too much for me. I soon learned that the translation was so terribly compromised for readability, I was missing out on a lot of important meaning. The NRSV is a fantastic balance between readability and accuracy, if you ask me. Thinking of giving a Bible to new believer or someone just starting to study it? Give them an NRSV!If you're considering this particular printing for your main Bible, I'd suggest shopping around first. But overall, I'm satisfied.",

This collection of Dore's 241 Bible plates from Dover Publications sells for a very reasonable price. I think some of Dore's illustrations are wonderful. Among my favorites are a portrait of Amos, Jesus and the woman of Samaria, and the arrival of the Good Samaritan at the inn.One thing that makes Dore's illustrations engaging is the fact that he sometimes chose to illustrate stories that are not well known. Examples include the stoning of Achan (Joshua 7:12, 24, 25) and the Levite finding the corpse of the woman (Judges 19:26, 27.) I found a number of these illustrations so compelling and sad that I went to the Bible to learn the stories. If you wish to become familiar with lesser-known parts of the Bible, perusing Dore's illustrations is one way to motivate yourself.I must add a word of caution. Some of Dore's black and white engravings are very graphic and unappealing to me. His rendition of David with Goliath's severed head, for instance, is one I would never share with a child. Nonetheless, if you look at Dore's illustrations, I think you'll find them thought provoking and well done.",

However, at the bookstore where I got it, I had the opportunity to compare both editions. I eventually bought the hardcover, but I did wonder for a while which one to pick up.To be honest, I preferred the print of the paperback edition, which had higher level of contrast - it was on white paper while the hardcover is printed on cream yellow tinted paper. However, I finally got the hardcover - well, because it is hardcover :))) and has a more luxurious look which I though was worth the 4-pounds price difference.Now, several words about the edition. The title says it - it is not the Bible, it is the Dore illustrations to the Bible. Anyhow, each illustration holds an explanation of what is seen, so it is pretty fine.The point which did diasappoint me was that I expected the complete set of illustrations that Dore did, until I read it was just a selection of the finest ones.A note which might be interesting for the audience about the disputed image of Creation with the missing angel in the background (seen in older reviews) - the introduction explains it was a version that Dore did himself, and it is practically an original.I recommend this book to anyone who loves illustration, Dore and/or Biblical subjects.",

                "review/text": "When reading the Bible in different translations readers are often struck by the different words used by different translations. That is even between two Literal (word-for-word) translations (like the King James and the NRSV). When you get into a Dynamic Equivalence translation (like NIV) or a Free translation (like Phillips) you can be astounded, and wonder if the translators were using the same source material. Idealy, students of the Bible should be able to read it in the orginal Hebrew, Aramaic, and koine Greek. But that's an ideal the vast majority of us will never be able to meet. Enter the Amplified Bible. The purpose of the AB is to give English readers a better feel for the original material by amplifying the translation.The AB starts with an excellent Literal translation and then uses brackets and parentheses to amplify any word that doesn't have a literal English equivalent. Brackets []contain clarifying words or comments not in the original. Parentheses () include additional meanings to the original word that the English word doesn't, for example the Greek work transliterated as pisteuo, is usually translated as 'believes', but in the orginal actually means much more. See my example from John in the next paragraph.John 11:25- &quot;Jesus said to her, I am [Myself] the Resurrection and the Life. Whoever believes in (adheres to, trusts in, and relies on) Me, although he may die, yet he shall live.&quot;Why do I title this &quot;Outstanding Second Bible&quot;? I find that for my first read thru on any section, I prefer to use a good study Bible, as the amplified material interrupts the flow of the narrative. Especially for those new to Bible study, the amplifications can be confusing. Read your primary Bible first, then look at the AB to ensure you have a good grasp of the word meanings. My personal recomendations for primary study Bibles are: for Literal translation, the &quot;Harper-Collins NRSV Study Bible&quot;, and for Dynamic Equivalence translation, the &quot;Concordia Self-Study Bible (NIV)&quot;.To sum up, the Amplified Bible is an outstanding tool for anyone interested in serious Bible study, my only caveat is that it shouldn't be your primary text.",

It sounded like a great idea. But when I tried reading it, I found that the \"amplifications\" which the authors give, claiming to simply be providing the full meaning implicit in the original texts, are often extremely biased or misleading.As an extremely minor example, in the AB translation Hebrews 1:4 refers to Christ's \"glorious Name (title)\". But the word \"Name\" here is better read as a reference to His nature and not just His title - the word can have that meaning in Scripture (see John 17:6). So the \"amplification\" here takes the reader farther away from the best reading rather than closer to it - you'd be better off reading it without their \"clarification.\"In general, this translation will often take a word that is ambiguous in the original language, something that scholars may disagree on the meaning of, and instead of translating it to an equivalent and ambiguous English word will instead provide a very specific interpretation. It would be one thing if this were done as a suggestion; maybe a footnote stating, \"Many scholars interpret this passage to mean this-or-that.\" But it doesn't say anything like that; it just substitutes the authors' specific interpretation as if it were the word of God itself, rather than honestly rendering the ambiguities. The average reader would have no way of knowing this has been done!Furthermore, the Amplified Bible is based on the Minority Text which is acknowledged by most scholars I know of to be corrupt and overall less trustworthy than the Textus Receptus or the Majority Text (the basis for the KJV, and NASB, among others). But aside from that, the bias of the translation alone is a good reason to ditch this version. Overall, the amplifications provided by the authors are rarely helpful - most of them are just redundant, adding clunkiness to the reading without adding any real information. Often, they are misleading or just plain wrong.I would recommend the NASB (New American Standard Bible) instead, as it is highly recommended as an accurate and literal translation.",

Being a NT Greek scholar, I have performed many translations from the original Greek texts of Luke, Paul, and others in the New Testament. I understood how hard it is to translate a certain word into English and impart the same connotations that are apparent to native speakers and readers. Naturally, the Amplified Bible's claim intrigued me, and I picked one up for an agreeable $15 to see if they were right. With what I have read so far (mostly Paul's letters), I am very pleased at how the Amplified Bible gets across those important nuances and meanings. They use parentheses around words or phrases that are carried with the original text, and they use brackets around words or phrases that would clarify the meaning of the original text. I am also very happy with the Amplified Bible's translations of the nuances too. They are comprehensive without being too academic - they are important and to the point.Howevery, this may not be the best Bible for daily reading or use in small groups due to its literal translation. This is particularly felt in Paul's letters, where a simple, polished reading isn't there even in the original text. But it is essential as a second Bible for personal use, as well as with a Bible study or theological work.

It claims to express \"nuances\" of the original Hebrew and Greek texts.Now this idea does sound noble. There are many nuances of especially the Greek text that do not translate very easily into English. However, in trying to be so expressive, the Amplified can be very awkward to read. The extreme \"amplification\" of the word \"blessed\" in the Beatitudes demonstrates this problem. Each Beatitude begins, &quot;Blessed-happy, to be envied, and spiritually prosperous [that is, with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation regardless of their outward circumstances]....&quot; Reading nine such amplifications in a row is very tedious.But even more importantly, many of the Amplified Bible's \"amplifications\" are rather questionable. For instance, in Hebrews 1:4 in the Amplified, Jesus is said to have inherited &quot;the glorious Name (title).&quot; But Jesus' &quot;glorious Name&quot; is more likely merely a reference to His nature not just His title (see John 17:5). &quot;Name&quot; in Scripture often has this wider meaning.So the idea behind the Amplified Bible is good, but the readability and quality leaves something to be desired.

                "review/text": "I own and use the NIV, NASB, NKJV, RSV and NRSV study Bibles and three Life Amplification Bibles. While each of these Study Bibles have their individual strengths and weaknesses, all are indeed helpful in understanding the everlasting messages given to us from God. It is not my intention to critique each version in detail. My purpose for this review is to, hopefully, add some information a first time Study Bible buyer might find useful.Of the Study and Life Amplification Bibles I own, Dr. Scofield's is my personal favorite for several reasons. I will briefly describe those reasons.A] Some Study Bibles somewhat overwhelm the reader with information while others are far too abbreviated. Since the foregoing statement is a personal opinion, I will not name the too much and too little Study Bibles. I do not want to add more confusion to a selection so important to one's spiritual growth. Dr. Scofield's essays, commentaries and explanations are an excellent middle ground to the above listed pros and cons.B] All study expositions are thoughtfully placed on the same page - bottom - of the passages they refer to. As way of example, Dr. Scofield lists the Greek, Aramaic and Hebrew words that can have more than one translation and tells the reader the possible meanings of the translations. However, Dr. Scofield does not restrict his commentary to semantics. He also explains difficult passages and gives details about customs and life in Biblical times. Other Study Bibles do this also but Dr. Scofield's approach is far more \"down to earth\" and in clear language.C] The center column cross-references are exceptional. The first to last listing of a particular word or idea is cross-referenced so the reader can easily go back or forward to see each reference. This is very useful in understanding the growth of God's plan for us.I own the NKJV and the KJV. The NKJV of Dr. Scofield' New Study Bible does not have his original notes and comments. I find the study notes in the NJKV scanty compared the original KJV.Finally, a comment about the various Bible versions. The NIV, NASB, RSV, NSRV, et al are in today's English. Some people find these versions easier to read and some say the KJV is difficult to read. Others claim the KJV is inaccurate. True, we now have more documents than the translators in the 1600s BUT the message is still the same. I, personally, prefer the KJV to all others. I will read a couple chapters in the today's versions and stop. That is not the case with the old KJV. I will read an entire chapter at one sitting. The reason is the beauty of the English of the time King James commissioned the translation. Yes, there are words we no longer use like thee, thou, art, and verb endings like dost and commeth. To me, that is the sheer poetic beauty of the language. The Old English has a lyrical flow that is a pleasure to read. I could compare the Old English to reading Italian opposed to Russian.The KJV Old Scofield Study Bible is an excellent choice for those beginning to study God's word and those who are more advanced. Oxford University Press does a superior job in printing and binding. My copy is genuine leather and indexed. I am very pleased with my purchase and would not hesitate to buy this Bible again.",

The New Scofield was put together in 1967 by an independant committee. They added numerous notes that certainly would not have agreed with Dr. Scofield. Example: Acts 8:12- They talk about baptism being not only done by immersion, but by sprinking and pouring. The KJB explains that true water baptism is by immersion only. They also mess with the KJV text by adding double meanings that are different from the Old Scofield Bible. For people wanting to buy a Scofield Bible because of the author's great umderstanding of the scriptures, should be advised to buy the &quot;Real One&quot;.

Let me be honest right from the start by saying that God's Word does not make any sense unless it is understood with a dispensational perspective. Anything less than that, and your stuck with a Bible that contradicts itself all over the place. All a believer has to do is allow God's Word to interpret itself, instead of listening to the so-called scholars of higher Christian education. They are the main reason for the Laodicean apostasy we find ourselves in today. Scofield did a good job at letting God's Book speak for itself. I have discovered by experience that most of the study bibles out there on the market today are filled with nothing but the authors private interpretation of the scriptures. What's so difficult about just believing what God's Word says, and not adding your own thoughts to it. The Scofield Study Bible does have it's weaknesses on certain passages, but overall it surpasses any other study bible currently out there. With all due respect, people that haven't discovered this have never really searched and studied the Book &quot;with their hearts&quot; well enough to make any worthwhile comment on the subject. Given the choice, I choose to listen and trust God's Word, and not the liberal Christian scholars. Ahhh, there's nothing like a King James Bible to clear up a college education.",

Although text critical scholarship may have moved on, the basics of a book that has lasted millenia do not change in a mere century. As chief editor to the combined bible, commentary, and chain reference Scofield provides the basics - and more - very well indeed. I have found nothing quite so precise, so concise, and nothing displaying such moderation and common sense, all couched in a style with a minimal jargon.For the Old Testament there is a one-page introduction to the Pentateuch, the historical books, the poetic and wisdom books, and the prophetic books. For example, there is a description of the key technique of Hebrew poetry (parallelism of thought) in the introduction to the poetical and wisdom books. The basic variations on this technique are demonstrated with great clarity and economy. For the New Testament there is an introduction to the gospels, the epistles of Paul, and the general epistles.One of my most loved features is the concise concordance at the back, which is compiled with an eclectic brilliance. Some of the footnotes are small masterpieces of exposition, some push concepts such as typology much too far. But I do not suppose Scofield would have declared this work to be perfect, or incapable of being usefully updated.",

I have the same feelings for the Ryrie Study Bible. Scofield is the way to go and Oxford Press offers a high quality Bible at a good price.

                "review/text": "The Scofield study bible has useful, and in some ways unique features, which enhance the King James or Authorised version of the bible. Scofield had a problem in that at the time of writing he knew that the KJV was not the best text available. New Hebrew and Greek biblical documents had been discovered since 1611, and textual criticism had advanced greatly. However, Scofield manages to preserve the universally recognised beauty of the Authorized whilst enhancing the textual accuracy at vital points with in-line glosses (word or phrase substitutions), with the original King James text moved to the margin. These glosses are indicated by a pair of vertical line | like this |. A good example of this is found in John chapter 1, verse 12: the phrase 'sons of God' is rendered as 'children of God'. This had the double virtue of being a more accurate translation of the Greek 'tekna theou', and is also gender-neutral - politically correct before his time! An Old Testament example would be Ex. 20 v.13, the well known 'Thou shalt not kill'. Here 'kill' is footnoted, and there is a one sentence explanation that, while there are several Hebrew words for 'kill', this instance means 'murder' as it has our modern legal sense of unlawful premeditated killing.Other features include doctrinal summaries in the form of extended footnotes on the great themes of scripture, such as the section in John's gospel on grace. I think these are best described as conceptually rich and information dense. The coherence of the Old to New Testament sweep is such that several sermons or bible studies could be culled from any one of these summaries. Their usefulness in personal study is immense and sometimes saves the cost of a specialist reference book. The chain reference system enables one to follow a very extensive line of thought from the first bible occurrence of a word or concept through to the last. There are useful organised expositions of Judaistic culture, worldview, and thought habits. An excellent example of this would be the handling of the Hebraic habits of naming and word play (I don't call them 'puns'). One of the most potent of these is his analysis of the Names of God, from Elohim to 'Alpha and Omega'.Having said all I have to say in a laudatory vein, I have to add that sometimes Scofield's conciseness is too clipped for his own good. He gives cut-and-dried answers to things which would be better handled as 'maybe this, or maybe that', and this is guaranteed to irritate the true scholar at times. He can also make comments which are so text-critically controversial that he would be better off passing over them in silence, an example of this would be the four line footnote on the 'woman taken in adultery' in John chapter 8. But buy it and not regret it is my only advice.",

It includes a dictionary for those now obscure old English terms.This is a very basic Bible as there are no textual notes, or concordance. No cross references either. This helps to keep the Bible small. This is the original King James style. \"Saviour\" is spelled with seven letters, not the modern six letter \"Savior\", for instance. No brackets around the longer ending of Mark, or notes about the \"trinity verse\" otherwise known as 1 John 5:7.The only downside is that the paper is not as nice as that found in the other Cambridge Bibles. The more expensive Cambridge Bibles have absolutely beautiful paper. Keep in mind though, that at less than $45, this Bible is about the best constructed Bible that you will find.All in all, this standard text edition is a great buy if you are looking for a well constructed Bible without a lot of mass.

It has untainted romance, drama, song, wisdom, and even tips for athletes! :) Most importantly, it tells us how we were made by a perfect God Who requires perfection; when we fell short of His perfection, he didn't simply condemn us to hell--he actually became one of us; and not even a prestigious one of us. He bore our sorrows, was fully acquainted with all the grief we take, yet didn't even stop short of death. Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friend. And because he IS a loving yet just God, he doesn't push himself on us. John 14:6-He tells us he is the way, and Rev. 3:19-20 he asks us to accept him, yet in this love story he gives us a choice. This is what's so beautiful about the Bible. Read it, love it, obey it, but please don't reject it. But it is a choice for each of us. To quote Jesus Christ, my Saviour, &quot;Will you also go away?&quot; Let's answer him, &quot;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.&quot;",

However, sometimes I desire only to read through passages in the Bible - particularly the Psalms, prophetic books and the Gospels - merely reflecting and drawing on the spiritual riches to be discovered therein. So, I don't want pronunciation marks, notes, references, red-letter text or other things to distract me. This Bible meets this need for the most part. I only wish it included the Apocrypha as well.The type is large enough that even my over-used eyes read over the text with minimal strain. The lack of \"helpful\" diacritics and the other items described above make reading this Bible a pleasure to hold and read. Like all Cambridge Bibles, this too is well made and beautiful to behold.

For example, the leather on the back cover is thicker than the leather on the front cover, some of the pages weren't trimmed properly, and one page was hideously deformed during the cutting process because it was dog-eared.Still, all faults aside, I challenge anyone to find a better and more economical Bible for this price. It even rivals the &quot;venerable&quot; Scofield Reference Bible!Note: For those of you who are KJV fanatics, you'll be thrilled to know that this Bible is very similar to the original edition of 1611.

Cambridge Bibles are always of top-notch quality, and this Bible is no exception.The leather is sturdy and smells wonderful. The Binding is strong, but made so that you can lay the Bible flat on a desk. The size of the Bible is just about perfect: 7.5\"x5.5\"x1.25\" according to my ruler. It is almost exactly the same size of the Cambridge Brevier Reference RSV Bible (which I also recommend for those seeking a more modern translation).Now to the interior. The page is split into two columns with cross-references listed in the middle. The typeface is very legible, and is quite large for how portable this Bible really is. Pronunciation marks are provided for all proper names.Now, for those seeking a reference Bible, this is not really the place to look. There is no commentary aside from the verse cross-references, and it is not even broken up into paragraphs with subheadings. But I prefer this in a devotional Bible. It is nice to be able to just read as I would any other book without depending on editors' interpretations of paragraph and section breaks. There are headings to each page which will help with navigating the Bible, but other than that, each page is just pure, unadulterated Biblical text.In the back is a very nice (though small) concordance which will do in a pinch and a Bible dictionary, which is very helpful for understanding some of the obscurities of the KJV language. Finally there are several beautiful color maps to round out the reference tools.In conclusion, this is a beautiful Bible that I enjoy using. It's hard to beat the KJV for poetic language, and if you're in the market for a very nice devotional Bible in that translation, you can't go wrong with this Cambridge edition.",

Overall, an excellent edition of the Bible to have, and even though one is an evangelical who rejects any merits to be found in the apocryphal books, they are still good to be acquainted with to bridge that huge gap between the Testaments (400+ years). If your looking at other editions of the Cameo reference Bible by Cambridge, consider this one strongly as it has all the features of the calfskin edition, plus the Apocrypha, equalling the most complete leather-bound edition of the KJV out there (Oxford University Press prints a paperback edition tainted with secularist editorials.) The only things this version lacks is the \"Translators to the Reader\" forward (it has the Epistle Dedicatory to King James), and an optional red-letter edition.

                "review/text": "The only statement the publiser/editors make about how this revision differs from the landmark first edition (1985) and the well-received second edition (1995) is found on page xviii: &quot;In this fully revised edition of the NIV Study Bible, the Associate Editors and I have added hundreds of new study notes, improved the book introductions (e.g., paying greater attention to the rhetorical, structural and other literary features) and enhanced other helps.&quot;A certain amount of the &quot;Evangelical defensiveness&quot; I found bothersome in the 1995 edition has been burnt off in the nicely-conceived, thoughtful re-expression of book introductions found here. Compare, for instance, these statements from the Introduction to Job:[1995 ed.] &quot;Two dates are involved: (1) the date of the man Job and his historical setting, and (2) the date of the inspired writer who composed the book.&quot;[2002 ed.] &quot;Two dates are involved: (1) that of Job himself, and (2) the composition of the book.&quot;While the editors have not gone overboard trying to turn the NIVSB into a &quot;pc/inclusive language&quot; text, they have restated a few things here and there that, to my sensibilities, seemed worth fixing. For instance:[1995 ed., from Wisdom Literature Introduction] &quot;The Jews sometimes speak of the OT as the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings.&quot;[2002 ed., page 725] &quot;An ancient tradition among the Jews divided the collection of their holy books into three major divisions: the Law (Pentateuch), the Prophets (Former and Latter) and the Writings.&quot;These are small but welcome changes. [For those who may be following the controversy about the &quot;Today's New International Version&quot; translation, an adaptation of the NIV which endeavors to use gender-inclusive language when both men and women are clearly being discussed or addressed, the NIVSB uses the &quot;unaltered&quot; NIV. This is a good choice for a Study Bible, since serious Bible students need to confront the patriarchy of the ancient world at some time or another. The notes, rather than the translation of the text, seems the best place to accomplish this.]Although I see nothing in the introductions and notes that should be alarming to the book's primary audience (Evangelical Christians), the NIVSB now seems worthy to be used by Christians from other Protestant traditions, as well as by the general reader who may be curious about the Bible as one of the most important texts of Western civilization.The NIVSB continues to use three &quot;icons&quot; with its introductions, charts, and notes: a &quot;seedling&quot; to suggest an item that will help the reader apply something to her/his personal life; a &quot;trowel&quot; to identify items based on archaeological discoveries; and &quot;a human head&quot; to call attention to items relating to key characters. One could read the notes carefully and dispute the way these icons have been assigned throughout the text, but the editors should be applauded for their judicious restraint. To tag more notes with icons (or to introduce more types of icons) would have created visual clutter. The publisher should also be applauded for making the icons gray instead of solid black as in the previous editon; it's easy to read around them. (I only pay close attention to the &quot;trowel&quot; icons, because I am personally curious about what in the Bible can and cannot be confirmed by external evidence; although I usually skip the &quot;seedlings&quot;--because I don't like to be told how to apply Scripture to my life--these notes often discuss key theological concepts and are equally worth reading.)The typography is improved in the 2002 edition, most notably in the center column reference system. However, I still find it difficult to know where to look when I see a superscript marker in the Scripture text (To the center column or at the foot of the Scripture text?). At some points in the text, there are two superscript markers! For example, the name &quot;Immanuel&quot; in Matthew 1:23 is followed by a roman superscript &quot;d&quot; and an italic superscript &quot;w.&quot; Oddly, both identify Isaiah 7:14 as the related text. Although, I suppose, there's nothing technically wrong with stating something more than once, I think it unnecessary in a book so tightly packed with information. The unintended effect on the reader might be to erode his/her willingness to pay attention to the notes or to bother to look things up. That would be unfortunate, indeed, because there's a lot in the revised NIV Study Bible that is worth checking out.",

                "review/text": "The main difference between this new 2002 and the previous 1995 revision is the inclusion of 800 new study notes. A quick browse through easily reveals a number of these, the first of which being at the first line of Genesis. There are also a number of explications to replace the frustrating \"See note at Psalm 15:2\" type of notes. Now they sometimes tell you why you should see it. Many of the earlier notes are also revised based on comments from seminary students, professors and pastors to bring them up to date with current conservative evangelical scholarship. There are also a few more charts in this version, a couple of new color maps (only dropping one, the pointless \"The World as it is Today\" from the previous edition). The typography is also slightly different, as are the icons used to denote archeology and life application passages. The font used for the headers is also different (in my view a slight improvement since it makes it easier to quickly spot stories and parables), and the comfortable font used for the Bible text itself remains unchanged. The standard edition is 2198 pages not including color maps, while the 1995 version was 2172. The spine of the leather version is also more stylish than the 1995 edition, simply stating \"Zondervan NIV Study Bible\" and \"NIV\" and \"Zondervan\" near the bottom. The 1995 edition said \"The NIV Study Bible\" \"New International Version\" \"Words of Christ in Red Letter\" and \"Zondervan,\" which made it a little busy. Oh, yes--the new version contains no family record pages, apparently realizing that study Bibles are used for study and not as heirlooms. There's only a nice presentation page and then it gets right into the timelines. All in all I highly recommend this update--and that's only after a quick browse-through! Frank",

While I use them all, my favorite for study and for Scripture reading is the NIVSB. The language is easy to understand and the study notes are fairly comprehensive. The commentary hails from a conservative evangelical theology.Book binding quality:The binding is strong and is durable. I've carried this Bible around a lot, and it has held up with no sign of failure.Scripture Page layout:The Scriptures are laid out in the natural paragraph form, rather than the bullet form based on verse numbering. The Scriptures are laid out in two columns, with a column for Scripture cross-references in the middle. The bottom of each page contains commentary listed by corresponding verse. The words of Christ are in red, and contextual sections have headings that correspond to the outline at the beginning of each book.Introduction to Books:Each book of the Bible has a discussion of the author, audience and purpose, date and place of writing, characteristics, sources and a short outline of the book.Commentary:The notes deal with archaeological, historical, lexical (minimal lexical inputs) and cultural aspects that pertain to conservative hermeneutical exegesis. In disputables, the often do make definitive conclusions, but also at times give different views giving info on what the editors believe is the most probable correct conclusion. It is impossible to put all information on a topic into a study Bible, but the NIVSB does a good job of packing a lot of information in for a significant level of understanding.Indices:There are several helpful and easy to use indices at the back of the Bible. An Index of Subjects acts as a topical study help. An Index of Notes acts as an index for the subjects of NIVSB commentaries. There are several map and measurement aids and finally a standard but fairly comprehensive concordance is included.A note on the NIV translation:The NIV translation is a controversial translation. It has begun to outsell the long-beloved King James Version (KJV) Bible. I am not here to say one translation is the one to read while another should be shunned. I prefer to study many different versions, hence my use of parallel Bibles. But, please know that many of the negative reviews tend to be based on dislike of the NIV translation. Until Zondervan creates a parallel study Bible, this will remain one of my favorite Bibles.To find comprehensive information of a topic or passage, I use my Thompson Chain Reference. For seminary study, I use parallel Bibles (Evangelical Parallel NT and NIV/KJV Parallel). For initiation of a study, reading and study away from home, I use the NIVSB. There is a wealth of information in this study Bible.",

                "review/text": "I received this Bible as a gift a number of years ago, and I've used it regularly ever since. Personally, I prefer the New American Standard version for studying and reading, but I always keep this Bible handy for its unbeatable study notes and cross references. The notes, written to be nondenominational and always upholding the infallibility of the Bible, shed light on difficult passages and historical information, helping readers get the most out of time spent in God's word. Bible book introductions are often several pages long and discuss the book's origins and themes. And between the cross references and the excellent included concordance, I've been able to examine what the rest of the Bible says regarding topics in the passages I've studied. In fact, I often copy information out of this study Bible and put it in my other Bibles, so that I can always have easy access to information about my favorite verses and chapters.How this Bible looks also makes it stand out. The leather is high quality and attractive. Inside, the font size makes reading easy on the eyes, and other formatting features help make the Bible simple to use and navigate. Its size makes it a bit cumbersome for everyday use while on the go, but for at home study and going to church, there's no problem.Bottom line: NIV fans who want excellent study supplements inside an attractive cover simply can't go wrong with this Bible. The highly respected, easy to read translation combined with top notch study notes, cross references, and a concordance make this Bible a great way to set out on the journey of studying God's word.",

                "review/text": "I was surprised by some of the negative comments about the NIV Study Bible, though my own opinions of it are less than raving about its perfection. While not the best around, I did find it has some definite redeeming features, (apart from the end, of course).The NIV has a very useful cross-reference system, (for which it is justifiably well-known), that makes pursuing a particular topic or item through the Bible very easy. This makes finding things a breeze. In addition, and contrary to some, the subject index and concordance are pretty good. Yes, they are very basic, but this is a Bible and not a concordance in itself. I did not find anything wrong with them, and they were pretty useful.There has been some comment about the introductions to each book, and I have found to be reasonably balanced and realistic about the evidence. In some cases, I would personally suggest even later dates for the books than the NIV gives. While the introductions are not perfect, (for more detailed information, see the real evidence out there), they do the job. I don't see how dating books accurately according to evidence is \"godless\" or in anyway detrimental to the Bible. Anyway, back to the point: the introductions are not detailed, but they are adequate for the task.I found the translation to be ok in most cases, though in some places, it seems to soften the ideas and teachings of Christ. This is noticeable when it is compared with other versions, which take a more literal translation as a technique. A teaching on marriage and not being married seemed to be softened in the NIV as compared to others. While I have no problem with the \"dynamic equivalence\" method, (it is not paraphrasing, as some seem to think), the NIV highlights the need to check with a couple of translations, unless you are going at it from the Greek, as well. This is something which makes me cautious to recommend the NIV as a primary study reference.While limitations of space have a significant effect on how much commentary you get, the NIV could have a little more. Admirable effort at leaving the real thinking to the reader, but in some nasty places there was very little commentary given, and it would have been useful.Overall, the NIV is not bad, and certainly not worth burning along with the other heretical works. It does a good job, and it has some very good features that make studying it easy, functional and even fun. Apart from the concerns above, it is pretty good.",

What I liked about it was that it is a widely accepted translation, excellent commentary on most every verse (important to someone like me that did not grow up reading The Bible), and a lot of contextual information (drawings, book introductions, etc).For the uninitiated, it is a toss-up between this and the Quest Study Bible, also published by Zondervan. The Quest has a slight edge for the lay person as opposed to the serious Bible student -- it has answers to a number of blunt questions that may cross your mind, but which do not classify as Bible Study.I purchased a leather bound edition of this Bible from an Amazon seller. It was brand new, in unopened packaging, in leather, for far less than the list price of the paperback version. So, shop around the Amazon marketplace sellers before you buy.The only quibble I have is that Zondervan does not stitch the spine of its Bibles (atleast not the one that I have). No matter how carefully you treat it, a stitched spine always beats a gummed spine. See if you can get an edition with a stitched spine for a few extra dollars. It will be worth it.",

I also have the Oxford New Annotated Bible and the Harper Collins Study Bible sitting on my shelf right now and the NIV is without a doubt my favorite and most helpful study bible (followed by the Oxford). The cross references may be the best thing about this study bible! They are amazing! If you wish to find any of the obscure Old Testament prophetic references in the book of Revelation, for example, the center column cross refernces are your best friend. In addition the NIV has (I believe) the largest concordance of any major study bible, which makes finding that reference that you only sort of remember much easier. The notes in earlier editions were slanted a bit in the Reformed-Calvinistic direction, but the revisions of the last few years are supposed to make for a more ecuminical study bible. The introductions to the sections and books are also very good, TONS of info is included about the historical contexts from which the different books come in addition to the theological emphases. I HIGHLY recommend this study bible for pastors, students, and anyone who wants a better understanding of the Scriptures.",

It combines a readable and reliable translation, excellent reference material, and unbiased commentary. I have seen this study Bible through all it's previous editions and am continually impressed.Pros:1) The readable and reliable NIV text.Some people can be rather critical of the NIV even to the point of accusing this translation of heresy. Such accusations are completely without merit. I have studied from the NIV for over 20 years and I have never found it to be anything but reliable.2) Excellent reference material.Cross-references, maps, charts, timelines, historical context, and more. This study Bible has just about everything you would need for a complete study of any given passage. Granted, space restrictions do not permit an exhaustive analysis of any of the above. However, there is more than enough information to satisfy all but the most intensive reader.3) Good commentary.The study notes offered in this Bible are excellent. They do not enforce any one denominational position and present various viewpoints on disputible issues.4) Easy to read print.I do not know what kind of font was used for the printing of this Bible but it is incredibly easy to read.Cons:1) Thin paper.Unfortunately the paper quality for many of Zondervan's Bibles has been rather poor recently. It is ultra thin, probably to allow for thinner Bibles. It can be distracting to see the opposite page through the one you are reading. Especially if the next page is a chart or a map. This can also cause problems for people who like to take notes in their Bibles.2) Only available in the NIV.As I've said in the Pros this format is very good for Bible study. It would be nice to have this available in another translation for those who prefer a more formal translation like the NASB or ESV. There is a Zondervan NASB Study Bible that is very similar but it has not been updated along with the NIV.Overall, I would recommend this Bible to any one who desires to dig into God's word for themselves. You won't be steered wrong by this.",

If you've seen comparisons of the various Bible versions, the NASB generally is described as the most literal version (word-for-word accuracy) of the Bible that sometimes suffers in readability for that very reason. I believe the reputation has been largely undeserved. There were occasional awkward constructions but, all in all, it was quite readable. With this version they have gone back over sentence structure, vocabulary, etc. with a view toward improving the readability and flow of the language. They have also removed archaic words like Thee and Thou. I think they have succeeded in producing a readable translation without compromising the accuracy. We now have a literal, word-for-word translation that reads with the best of the modern versions.With this pocket NT with Psalms and Proverbs, I think they have done an excellent job balancing overall size of the Bible and font size/layout. It is small enough to comfortably fit in your pocket, but it is also quite comfortable to read. The quality is outstanding as are all the other Foundation Publications products I have seen. They really do a great job publishing Bibles.Highly recommended!",

It's a bit bigger than the NKJV Gideon's NT+ that I was carrying, so it sticks a 1/2 inch out of any shirt pocket. The print is a good size, and I find myself using it often.I like the NASB, but there are a few points I wish they'd done differently. (#1) Before the 95 updated version (and in the ASV and RSV), there was always a footnote on Matthew 19:9 saying that some ancient versions read like Matthew 5:32. This touches a very important doctrine, divorce and remarriage, and the footnoted variant should have been made the main reading, as it is from earliest reliable manuscripts, and is the only variant cited in early Christian writings. (#2) In 1 Corinthians 11, two different Greek words are both rendered \"covering\". The ASV distinquished by rendering one of these as \"veiling\", and the RSV maintained that distinction, but the NASB has blurred it by using one English word for both. (#3) In 1 Peter 3:3, the word \"merely\" is inserted, which waters down the real intent of the passage. At least it's still clear in 1 Timothy 2:9 that women should shun jewelry, etc.. The NASB is good about italicizing these added words so that you know what they added, but it would've been better to leave that word out (like the ESV does).It's because of \"small\" things like these that some conservative churches still use the KJV as the bible they can trust for doctrine.",

They also offer an alternate version similar in size and style, but it doesn't have the Concordance nor does it have scripture references in the column on each page. Those copies are sold on Amazon and listed without \"Reference\" in the title, and they also come at a slight discount compared to this version. However, the non-reference versions have more cover options to choose from.If you're looking for a really good quality, compact NIV Bible then look no further. I received the Italian Duo-Tone cover where the spine is dark brown and the rest is a lighter brown. It's a nice, soft leather that looks sharp and feels good to the touch but isn't too thin. It's a \"lay-flat\" Bible and should do so once broken in. It should go without saying, but the print size is very small in order to fit so much into a great travel size Bible. It also has a nice presentation page for you to fill out to give as a gift to someone. Overall, the quality seems top notch and I would expect this to last many years of heavy use. Don't use the measurements provided by Amazon though, I just measured the copy I received today at 6.7 inches tall, 4.5 inches wide, and .75 inches thick. It really is three quarters of an inch thick even though Amazon has the measurement at 1.6\".This copy as well as any printed on or after March 2011 should be the newly released NIV 2011 translation. By Googling \"Slowley\" you can find a great write up detailing the differences in this version compared to NIV 1984 and TNIV. It was created by a software engineer to show a comprehensive list of differences. With that said, debating translations is a fruitless endeavor and even the introduction to the new release indicates that NO translation is perfect, but that they made every effort to glorify God's word through this release.If you're having difficulty pinpointing the cover and style combo you want for a Thinline Bible, go to Zondervan's main website and search there. Find what you want and then search the ISBN on Amazon to be sure you get exactly what you're looking for. Otherwise you have to sift through the stock photos on Amazon for the cover you want which can be tough with the small pictures provided. I hope this helps you!",

Many of the study Bibles out there are great for reading at home, but they're so large and bulky that it makes them inconvenient to carry around. On the other hand, the reduced text size found in many smaller-sized bibles makes them difficult to read over long periods of time. I have pretty good eyesight so I CAN read small text, but it's so much nicer to have the text be normal sized like it is in this Bible. And yet somehow the NIV Reference Bible manages to still be one of the most conveniently-sized Bibles out there... It's just barely over an inch thick. The cover seems nice and durable and I LOVE the full 105-page concordance. I was worried that because this is a \"reference\" Bible (meaning it has a center column with cross-references to related scripture passages) it would be somewhat bulky, so when I ordered this Bible I also ordered the non-referenced version (NIV Thinline Bible, Italian Duo-Tone, Tan/Dark Tan). When you put them side-by-side, this NIV Thinline Reference Bible is SLIGHTLY thicker than the regular NIV Thinline Bible, but the difference is so tiny you would never know it just by looking at them. As for me, I'm going with the referenced one and giving the other Bible away to someone who needs it.",

It measures approximately 8.8x5.5x1, so it fits perfectly in the hand, and is very light which makes it perfect for travel. The black duo-tone cover is beautiful, with beautiful stitching for added durability! The pages are actually decently thick for such an economically priced Bible. The layout of the text is absolutely beautiful, and perfect. The font size is very readable, although not too large. The book introductions are perfect because they are only a few sentences that only give the basics to understanding the basic message of the book. There are 8 visually STUNNING maps in this edition, and a pretty exhaustive concordance (116 pages) for such a compact Bible. It even includes a helpful table of weights and measures as well!The text is the newly updated NIV (New International Version) 2011. The world's most popular and best selling translation has gotten even better in my opinion. Probably the most notable, and controversial, change is the emergence of gender neutrality. In the epistles, when addressing Christians \"brothers and sisters\" is now used instead of the traditional \"brothers.\" In my opinion, this is more accurate because today's English has changed significantly in the last 200-300 years. Where \"men\" and \"brothers\" represented both male and female traditionally, today we would say \"them\" and \"everyone.\" The use of \"brothers and sisters\" by the new NIV text is more accurate because it is safe to assume that in the early church there both male and female members, and since the letter was addressed to the church as a whole, the new NIV gets it more accurate in today's English by rendering it \"brothers and sisters.\"For the price, this Bible can't be beaten. It's durable, and got plenty of wonderful features! Buy this Bible!!",

                "review/text": "In this review I will endeavor to compare and contrast two rather similar bibles, which I own, published by Zondervan. They are:TNIV Reference Bible (Bible Tniv)andNIV Thinline Reference Bible, Large Print(2011). While they are quite similar in some ways, they also exhibit marked differences. I will begin with similarities and then give 6 key points in which they differ.The Similarities:Both bibles are nearly the same size, with the TNIV being slightly wider and thicker. This is somewhat surprising since the NIV 2011 is some 70 pages longer. More on this in the contrasts. Both are bound in black bonded leather. But here too there is a difference. Both have a ribbon marker and silver gilted edges. Both have columnar cross references, a concordance, a table of weights and measures, 8 pages of color maps and a word to the readers from the translation committee. So much for the similarities.The Differences:Binding: Although they both have bonded leather, the TNIV feels more supple and is more flexible than the NIV 2011 which has a distinct plastic-like feel about it. Perhaps it will soften up with use. The bonded leather binding does not allow either bible to lie flat from cover to cover. But herein is a significant difference. The TNIV will lie perfectly flat from about Gen 40 to the end of Rev. The NIV 2011 will only lie perfectly flat from Deut 1 to the end of Heb. Perhaps this will improve with time and handling too.Page Thickness: The TNIV has real thin pages. The NIV 2011 has real, REAL thin pages. This means that they crease easily. In the case of the NIV 2011, they crease real, REAL... Well you get the point. Thinness of page also accounts for why the NIV 2011 can be 70 pages longer and yet slimmer than the TNIV. BUT, despite the thin pages, bleed-through isn't any problem, at least not so far as I can see. Your mileage may differ.Print Size: The TNIV is said to be 9 point for the main text. Footnotes and cross references are smaller, of course. This is too small for me in my sixth decade of life. The NIV 2011 text size is supposedly 10.5 point. Ah, much better! This is one of the two reasons I decided to buy the NIV 2011, the other being the new translation.Page Format: The TNIV is single-column, while the NIV 2011 is double-column. This is no big deal for me, though I do tend to get lost more often in a single column of smaller print. There is some room to write brief notes and references in the margins of both bibles, though the single-column format is better suited for that purpose. I wish they put the column of references in the spinal margin rather than in the outer margin of the TNIV.Miscellaneous: The TNIV has a brief dictionary of terms, the NIV 2011 does not. The NIV 2011 has very brief book introductions, the TNIV does not. The TNIV has one very valuable feature, IMO, that the NIV 2011 does not have: Topical Ties. At the bottom of most pages there are anywhere from a couple to more than a dozen Topical Ties. A Topical Tie is a verse reference from the page that you're on plus a topic spelled out in a short phrase plus usually 3 reference links: the head link which Begins that topic in the bible, the link that comes immediately before the link on the current page and the link that comes immediately after. A typical tie looks like this from Acts -- 4:34-37 Sharing with the needy. B Lev 19:9-10. Ac 2:44-45 &lt;===> Ro 12:13. The other topics on that page are: Fellowship in the church; Hypocrites in the Bible; References to the unforgivable sin; Healing in the New Testament church; Numerical growth of the kingdom and church; Demon possession in the New Testament. It's very similar to the Thompson Chain Reference Bible. And now for...The BIG DISAPPOINTMENT, Cross References: The main reason I bought both these bibles was for the cross refs. I got what I wanted and paid for in the TNIV. But the the NIV 2011 disappointed me. The TNIV has exactly the same cross referencing system and cross references asZondervan TNIV Study Bible, Personal Size. That's more than 100,000 cross references! The NIV 2011 has far fewer, maybe half that many or less by my estimation. \"Well,\" you might say, \"the NIV 2011 has larger print. So naturally they had to cut something out.\" No! There's the irony. Virtually every column of cross references on every page of that bible is one third to one half blank! They had the room and didn't use it. Why? Furthermore, if both bibles had left out the 70 to 100 pages of useless concordances, there would have been not only enough room for 100,000 cross references but also enough room for 10.5 point type as well.My Recommendation:If your eyes are good, get the TNIV. It's the higher quality bible physically. You have a full set of cross references plus the Topical Ties. 92% of its verses are exactly the same as the NIV 2011 (but oh that 8%!). I paid $25.00 for the TNIV. But I've seen it for as low as $14.95 brand new. You had better act fast, though. They won't be around for long. If your eyes aren't good, get the NIV 2011 in large (or giant) print and bring it to church, to work, to bible studies and on vacation. But when you sit down at home to study, make sure thatNelson's Cross-Reference Guide to the Bible: Illuminating God's Word Verse-by-Verseby Jerome Smith is at hand because you won't find all the references you need in your bible.",

Because it is a thinline, it is easy to carry around.

                "review/text": "I have two \"addictions\" to which I will confess: Bibles in general and Bibles bound in fine leather. Having such an addiction, I recently acquired the updated 2011 edition of the NIV Thinline Reference Bible in premium leather and have spent some time examining both its binding and the new translation.As for the binding, this edition is very soft and supple. On some online sites, the leather is said to be cowhide. This may be the case, but nowhere on the Bible itself or on the packaging material does it say so. It just says \"premium leather.\" Whatever the leather is, it feels great in the hands, very smooth and buttery soft. The Bible has a very strong smell of leather, which I like very much, like walking into a leather shop. The cover itself is sewn around the edges and everything about my copy was quite symmetrical and well made. The Bible appears to have a sewn binding so that it lays flat right out of the box, although, again, it does not say so anywhere on the box. This feature of the Bible is very nice - the Bible seems to come straight from the box already broken in and will lay flat on the table immediately.The Bible paper is clear and bright without too much bleed through. The pages are edged in silver and will have to be carefully separated so as not to tear them. Once you have separated the pages the Bible will be perfectly limp and you will be able to easily turn to any passage. The print is good, very clear and readable. If you have trouble with smaller fonts, you may want to consider the large print version.I have two complaints about the binding, however. First, for apparently cosmetic reasons, the binding has a sewn seam which runs from top to bottom on the front cover. While this might give the Bible a distinctive look, it also gives it a weak point where the cover will begin to bend and wear out. The cover would have been much better if it had been constructed out of one single piece of genuine leather. Secondly, the end papers are made of thin paper rather than the traditional faux leather. This will result in the cover separating from the text block with normal use.As for the translation itself, this is where I was truly disappointed. While I applaud the translators' efforts to render the text in a more gender-inclusive fashion (something the New Revised Standard Version did over 20 years ago and the New Living Translation also does), the result in the 2011 NIV is grammatically atrocious. Consider the rendering of the last sentence in Colossians 2:18. \"Such a person also goes into great detail about what they have seen; they are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind.\" I will admit that my own grammar is far from perfect, yet this sentence makes me cringe. I showed this sentence to an English teacher, who was appalled. And the problem is systemic. Check out 1 Tim 5:8, 1 Tim 6:3-4a, James 4:17, 1 John 3:9, and there are scores of other similar texts. In my opinion, there is no excuse for this level of bad grammar in such a major publication.This update is quite massive, on a par with the differences between the 1977 NASB and the 1995 update, between the RSV and the NRSV. If one is expecting the classic NIV with a few tweaks, he will be gravely disappointed. Most of the translation updates seem to reflect the scholarship of the 1989 New Revised Standard Version. Another problem, for me at least, is that while the 2011 NIV has made improvements in certain renderings, those improvements are not consistent. Consider the updating of \"sinful nature\" in Romans 8 to \"the flesh,\" which is more accurate. Yet in Romans 7:14, the same phrase is rendered \"unspiritual,\" which is just confusing. Why not be consistent?Overall, this Bible gets high marks for the construction and binding, but very low marks for the new translation itself. Grammatically, I find many passages extremely distracting, and if I'm distracted by the horrendous grammar then I could be missing something important the Bible is trying to say.",

Too bad the American Bibles are such poorly made messes. This one has a nice, long, ribbon marker. The paper does not bleed through, so it seems ok to mark in it. I would certainly recommend this. It is quality. This is the traditional NIV of 1984 which remains the same, and is NOT that genderless, inclusive, politically-correct wonder, the TNIV.(Note 6-25-12) This Bible, like all of the 1984 NIV Bible, is no longer being printed. You should be able to get a copy on ebay or used book sellers. Since Zondervan has introduced the 2011 gender-inclusive NIV which used the TNIV as a base, thy have---in my humble opinion---mistakenly decided not to print the 1984 edition",
