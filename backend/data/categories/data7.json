This time she doesn't just want power over the fairy People - this time she wants the humans too. Captain Holly Short is the only fairy with a hope of stopping her, but as Holly knows, it takes one genius criminal mastermind to fight another. But the 14-year-old genius that Holly is thinking of doesn't even remember that fairies exist. How is she going to convince Artemis Fowl to help her stop Opal? Gold usually does the trick, and this time is should be no different. Or is Artemis changing?",

                "review/text": "If it were not for the occasional appearance of Mulch Diggums, the dwarf with f*rts so explosive they can propel him safely from an underwater submarine all the way up to the surface of the ocean, the adult reader would find this the equal of any thriller written for adult eyes.In the present volume, the evil child genius Artemis Fowl has forgotten all about his friends the fairies, and is occupied stealing a famous painting from a bank vault in true Mission-Impossible style. His triumph is interrupted by his archenemy pixie Opal Koboi, who has a plot (perhaps this won't surprise you) to destroy the world. Without giving away any of the rapid-fire plot developments, let's just say that Artemis, accompanied by Holly Short the intrepid LEPrechaun, Foaly the tech-wizard centaur, Artemis' bodyguard Butler, and the strangely compelling Mulch, fouls her plans (ok, sorry).The intriguing list of gadgets and devices author Eoin Colfer employs to move the plot forward includes: cloning, creatures who shed their entire skin and use it later as a disguise in a prison break, retinal imaging, 100 million tons of molten iron, heat-seeking missiles, spacesuits with helmets that carry biometric information back to the center of the earth, handguns that bond with their owners, etc.The ending promises a change for Holly, but a future with lots of Mulch and Artemis in it - and possibly some romance in later volumes.The excitement, pace, and humor would be precisely like the best PG-13 thriller you will see at the movie theatre this summer, were it not for the fact that many of the characters are fairies, pixies, trolls, and dwarfs. And just like those movies, a few parents will wish there were less, well, military hardware in this series. A few of the more humorless moms will wish there were fewer f*rts. If those things don't bother you, you should not let the kids keep it to themselves; it's a great fun read for all ages.",

                "review/text": "There's a sinister plot afoot to expose the fairy world, but who could be behind it? Surely not the most dangerous pixie criminal of all time? Opal Koboi has been in a coma for almost a year, and is in a secure mental institution under constant guard, yet as the title reveals, Opal has quite an arsenal up her virtual sleeve, and a hit list for revenge.Systematically and coldly carrying out her calculated plan, Opal leads her arch enemies at the LEPrecon police into a trap, and only instincts and pure dumb luck can save Captain Holly Short this time.Artemis has had his brain wiped after his last fairy encounter, and has returned to a life of crime, but with niggling undercurrents of niceness that even he can't explain. Suddenly, just as he succeeds in stealing a valuable painting, his world gets ripped from under him, as the fairy world collides unceremoniously with his own.Lots of action in this one, weapons, trolls, gadgets, magic and Mulch, and Artemis needs all his cunning and the retrieval of his memories if he wants to survive. It's his most physically demanding role yet, but he has to be at his strongest to match minds with Opal.You should really read books one to three before attempting this one, but you won't regret it for a second.Amanda Richards, May 3, 2005",

As usual the characters in this are fantastic!! We don't get as much from some of my favorites, like Foaly and Butler as we have in previous books, but they are still very strong presences. Colfer does a great job of telling one moment in time from various view points so the reader is always in the know (as much as anyone can be in regards to a criminal mastermind like Artemis Fowl, that is)(Spoiler warning)It does sadly have a character death, though it was handled very well. Artemis' thoughts and insights are great, and he and Holly share their special chemistry even with him not having his memories for most of the book. The last little blip in the book, an 'article' seems to promise alot more from my favorite 'reformed' child-mastermind, and the next book will be taking the characters in very different directions, it seems, than they have been traveling in the previous books. Not just the reformed Artemis, but Holly as well--and in some degree together.Awesome read!!",

First of all I would like to mention that a major character dies, and I am still in shock, but I will not tell you which major character it is. So if you do not like sad books, just don't read this.True to its name this book is about Opal Koboi's revenge on everyone who destroyed the B'wa Kell Uprising for her in the second book. This pretty much includes Artemis, Holly, Butler, Foaly, Commander Root, and Mulch.This begins when Holly and Commander Root are investigating a case about some irritating goblin that fooled Foaly's sensors. When they do this, a major character gets killed by Opal Koboi, and Holly is framed. It is shocking and sad, but Eoin Colfer handles it very well. By now you've probably guessed who the major character is, and that is my main big spoiler.Meanwhile Artemis Fowl is attemping to steal a famous painting, Opal springs a trap, and Holly runs up to the surface to save him. However Artemis has no memory of the People.Then Mulch gets involved, and things become really chaotic, although the chaos really didn't have much to do with Mulch.If you would like to find out how this great book ends, then I advise you to read it. And the ending is very suprising.If you have read the other Artemis fowl books, then I do not need to tell you how good this book is. You already know what the other Artemis Fowl books are like. If you haven't read the Artemis Fowl books, the I think you should start by reading the first one. It will make much more sense.",

                "review/text": "Opal's back!(Don't worry--only very minor spoilers, to give you a sense of the story arc--no major details are revealed!)In the fourth installment of the Artemis Fowl series for children by Eoin Colfer, the villain from The Arctic Incident returns to plague all the characters we love, including fourteen-year-old Artemis Fowl, manservant Butler, the elf Captain Holly Short and her commander Julius Root, the centaur Foaly, and the notorious criminal dwarf Mulch Diggums. (Juliet Butler is notably absent from this volume. I think she might be at bodyguard school.)Like the other Artemis Fowl books, this was enjoyable to read and featured the usual character growth, high-speed chases, amusing conversations, and (of course) tons of fairy gadgets. My one complaint is the same as ever: Mr. Colfer tends to brag about his fictional inventions and devote too much time to explaining how they work. But that's easily overlooked, considering how much effort was spent on character development and the usual intricate plot.I noticed a bit of a lean on the description, too; things were a bit more visual. And to his credit, Colfer manages to take away the \"it's a kids' book\" security he had laid in the previous books--that feeling that nothing to horrific can happen to the good guys--and he kills off a major and fairly beloved character who doesn't come back from the dead to make everything hunky-dory at the end. (I won't reveal who it is in my description of the book below, in case someone reading this fears spoilers.) All in all, very recommended, but not without reading the first three first. Without the background of the first three, you'll still enjoy this story but you won't be as affected by the losses and gains of the story and the growth of the characters.And, happily, another code graces the bottoms of the pages, just like in the first Artemis book. Fans of the books who have bothered to learn the Gnommish alphabet can translate and read a second little story along the bottom of each page. I of course did this. It informed me that I've been recruited as part of a human branch of the fairy police, except I don't remember it because they mind-wiped me. I'll bet! It gave me instructions on four things I have to do to join up with them again and how to contact them when I've satisfied the requirements. One of the requirements is to take a bath every day for a week. I dunno about that. . . .Here is a short synopsis, followed by some quotes I found most amusing.Villain Opal Koboi rises again from her apparent year-long coma, determined first to punish her enemies and second to take over the world. She focuses first on the LEP officers Holly and Root, managing to make most of the fairy world believe Holly is a bad guy before pointing her weapons at Artemis and Butler as they \"innocently\" try to steal a painting. In the last book, both the humans had their minds wiped by the LEP, but now of course they are again ensnared in a fairy mission beneath the earth, trying to stop Opal from wiping out half of Haven City with a fast-moving probe (and alerting humans to the existence of whatever fairies won't have died in the atrocity). Artemis, after reacquiring his memories, is surprised to find his personality changing back a bit to the way it was, finding a happy middle ground there between hardened juvenile criminal and charitable friend of human and fairy people alike. There is much character growth for Artemis especially, and Holly makes some difficult and surprising decisions before the end. It's entertaining to watch Opal Koboi go up against Artemis Fowl once again, to see that battle of wills and root for good to come out on top . . . whatever \"good\" is.My favorite quotes:Descant Brill: \"By the gods, this is the last time I break the boss out of a clinic and replace her with a clone.\"Artemis Fowl (pretending to be a typical teen): \"It's a game box. They were invented so teenagers wouldn't have to talk to grown-ups.\"Artemis Fowl, mocking Opal Koboi: \"How can you fail to take over the world with a booty box full of truffles?\"Narration, point of view of Artemis Fowl: She appeared to be conversing with a posterior. And then, even more amazingly, the posterior appeared to answer.Opal, to her goons: \"I assumed Artemis Fowl was dead once before, and I spent a year in a coma as a result.\"Opal, to her goons: \"You're looking directly at me. That's very bad for my skin.\"Opal, to Artemis as she attempts to kill him and realizes he's robbed her: \"My truffles?\" . . . \"You took them. That's just mean.\"Everyone! Read-read-read!",

If you have read and enjoyed other Burrough's novels, you'll get a kick out of this one: lots of Nova Mob intrigue, some truly funny industry parodies, and lots of familiar faces (Kiki, et al). But if you've found Burroughs difficult, or if you're easily offended by graphic homosexual goings-on, you should steer far away from this one. My personal rating is not so much against other literature, but against other Burroughs. Stacked next to them, I feel this is a good one. Very fast paced, and usually on target.

The battle is now raging in the language itself. And therefore in our own minds. The sentences with which humanity has manipulated its existence are under siege. Their order is cut up in the hope that through the black holes that are thus struck in them we may reach the silence so we may hear what's going on. Sometimes this means we have to struggle through a heap of rubbish, until we are no longer repelled by it and are free from its diseases. As a reward new ways of giving words to things are singing their strange but compelling songs to us in phrases that defy one dimensional meaning. The real sound of silence. To make us realize that these experiments are more than 'thoughtplays' and to keep us engaged in the process of 'unwriting' glimpses of stories weave themselves into this amalgam of prosepoetry and cut up text. In awe we get almost too physical views of the warfare and the journeys and haunts that accompany it, all on a science fiction and futuristic level. Details of this Nova Mob detective like narration are given to us in the next part of the trilogy, without entirely raising the curtain. It's a see for yourself message Burroughs is giving.",

                "review/text": "The Soft Machine is Burroughs's definitive work of cut-up and experimental writing. Most of the elements of the book are taken from the same period of writing that produced his first success Naked Lunch and are in many ways a natural continuation of that work. Many familiar characters pop up in The Soft Machine and many of the same themes of homosexuality, drug addiction, death, murder and corruption appear throughout. That being said, The Soft Machine is in many ways different from Naked Lunch. The most apparent is the total abandonment of any semblance to a coherent storyline. I will call this the cut-up style in the macro approach. There is a micro side of it as well. In almost every sentence Burroughs applies the technique to combine words and phrases that at first glance have no apparent connection or meaning together. The result is an interesting, if a bit tiring form of literary art.I started reading this book directly after I finished Naked Lunch and was a bit let down by it at first. I was looking for something that had a bit more meaning taken as a whole and The Soft Machine just isn't that kind of book. It was only after I realized this that I began to appreciate it for what it was: a conscious attempt to create a new literary form and actively use words to illustrate the patterns of society and life that we are too familiar and dependent upon. Addiction is a dominant theme in Burroughs's work and it normally manifests itself in the form of dope, but I think he uses his unique style to illuminate the other pervasive forms of addiction that he saw saturating society. Addiction is essentially concerned with control, the control of a substance over the actions and choices of an individual. For Burroughs a mode of though or way of life could be just as easily substituted for a substance as long as it met the conditions of addiction.The Soft Machine is an essential work and in many ways definitive in Burroughs assault against all the agents of control in our societies. Through a destruction of past literary forms and the resulting reconstruction into something utterly different he hoped to show not a solution to the problems confronting us, but rather to show us all how widespread and engrained the current system is.",

Burroughs' obsession with 'junk' is extreme, as is his fixation on orgiastic sex and sexually deviant practices. At least 50% of the book could be considered erotica if it weren't so intermingled with imagery of death and deformation that any aphrodisiac effect is squashed like a bug. This book is unparalleled in its obsessive obscenity, but there are visuals and concepts here that could not come from a sane mind, ideas that easily transcend into the realm of genius.There is no plot, and unlike the preceding \"Naked Lunch\", the chapters can't even really be thought of as short stories. The incoherency factor is scaled up to the next level with the increased use of the \"cut-up method\". It is not a novel.I think Burroughs was onto something with this idea, but that it makes \"Soft Machine\" a work that in the end is often little more than a nigh-random word salad, wherein any meaning taken really comes from the reader's mind. It will forever be a literary oddity, and many will find it absolutely impossible to read.

                "review/text": "Hunter X Hunter is good series with engaging, mysterious characters and an intriguing storyline. However, the long \"Hunter Exam\" arc may not appeal to everyone and the occasionally inconsistent artwork will likely upset some fans of Togashi's previous works. (There may be some SPOILERS ahead).The story is easy to follow and contains many clever and creative twists. Hunters are people with access to confidential information, restricted locations, and loads of wealth. To become a Hunter, you must acquire a liscense by passing the Hunter Exam. We are introduced to Gon, a young and ambitious inhabitant of Whale Island with a skill for communicating with animals. Gon aspires to obtain a Hunter's License and find his father Ging, a famous and successful Hunter. Througout Gon's journey to reach the Exam Hall, he encounters two interesting characters: Kurapika and Leorio. The three eventually become friends and together they tackle the rigorous and grueling Hunter Exam, meet remarkable adversaries, and struggle to acheive their goals.The first volume has a solid translation with what may seem like promising artwork to some. The art isn't bad but the quality varies too often. The first volume doesn't show this as well as later volumes which contain a few more inconsitencies (examples are the ending chapters of volume six with very sketchy designs).The characters are what really kept me reading. Gon seems a bit shallow and slightly immature but he is fiercely loyal and a skilled combatant. The designs of Leorio and Kurapika aren't fully developed when they are first introduced but they gradually fall into place. Leorio, despite seeming conceited and obsessed with money at first, is an admirable (and at times determined) character. His dialougue, however, doesn't seem to fit his character all the time (an example would be in volume five when he suggests a character tellls their opponent to go \"suck an egg\").Kurapika is upstanding and just but is never given a specific gender. I lean in favor of Kurapika being a guy so I will refer to him as a \"he\". Kurapika is very fair and very honorable. He does have a dark side which we see when we learn he and spiders don't mix. With a strong grudge against the Phantom Troupe who slaughtered his brethren, Kurapika is not one to joke with.Then we meet the more enigmatic characters who give the series a bit of a darker tone.Killua caught my attention right from the beginning. A kid with silver hair and a skateboard, he seems innocent and naive. But why are the drugs he ends up drinking ineffective? I do not wish to spoil anything about this character but be forewarned: Appearances are very deceiving.The last character I will mention is Hisoka; a psychotic clown with a set of combat skills. Hisoka is not one to trifle with as we later find out. He is clever and can kill without hesitiation. In volume six we learn how Hisoka makes his playing cards so sharp...

It IS meant to be a fun and entertaining romp through a colorful setting with colorful characters, and it succeeds at this well.Now, this comic is not exactly very fighting heavy, at least early on. If you buy comics only to see people beating the tar out of each other you may be disappointed. Instead, early on Hunter x Hunter relies more on dangerous situations that must be overcome using the main characters wits. So, think of it kind of like Indiana Jones but without guns tanks, and in a sort of modern fantasy setting.Now, the translation is pretty darn good and nothing appears to be censored as there are quite a few violent scenes. However, there is one thing keeping me from giving this manga a solid five stars and that's the art-style.Don't get me wrong, the art style is good, however occasionally things will look a little, under drawn. Often times this is actually a pretty neat effect, but other times it's a bit distracting and some people will not like it.All, things considered however, I highly recommend this title to anybody that is a fan of adventure or manga in general. I think most anybody will walk away feeling pleased with their purchase after reading the first volume or two.",

                "review/text": "That doesn't mean I don't like Yu Yu Hakusho, because I have all 19 volumes but, Togashi's writing in that series really prompted me to get into Hunter x Hunter.The back stories of the characters, the character development and also the subplots are so well delivered and they often overlap in very unique ways. This kind of writing is very hard for me to like, and the author presents it without it being confusing for me. (The overlapping plots in CLAMP's Tsubasa Chronicles for example hurt my brain, so I stopped reading the series).The artwork is not as advanced as Yu Yu Hakusho, but there are points where the work becomes very detailed and shows just how talented a drawer that the author is. There is much more dialogue, as well. This book is quite a bit bloodier, and the characters run into a lot of life or death situations.If you've read Yu Yu Hakusho you may notice similarities between the four lead characters and the Hunter x Hunter characters. Gon takes after Yusuke but very minimally, he is much more light hearted and gentle. Killua takes after Hiei as far as the gore is concerned... Leorio is a definitive Kuwabara, and Kurapika is the blonde version of Kurama. Still, these characters do have their own straights that separate them from other stories and make them very likable.I recommend this to anyone who wants to read a story, a very, very big story! You'll really love it.Edit: I feel it necessary to elaborate on the character's personalities a little bit more.Gon - He is neither good or evil, very neutral most of the time but he has a heart of gold and a love for all living things, even the bad guys. He tends to be very curious, and loves to learn about new tools, techniques and take on crazy challenges. The one thing that makes him identical to a character like Yusuke is, Gon is heroic, can take a beating and usually gets incredibly angry at anyone who kills others.Leorio - He's not the sharpest tool in the shed sometimes... He tends to act on impulse and lose his cool. Still, Leorio is a sweet character, with very strong ambitions and is also very loyal. Surprisingly though, he starts to take on a very strategic and calculating personality as the series moves on.Kurapika - I didn't particularly care for Kurama's character, he bored me when I first got into Yu Yu Hakusho. Kurapika has that calm, super-intelligent style, but he is much more interesting and his rage sets him far apart from Kurama. He has serious motives, and while he is respectful to the other lead characters, he doesn't seem to me like a loyal character to anyone but the people from his past.Killua - Of the four, I adore this character the most. He's rebellious, aggressive, somewhat hot-headed but he has a very child-like demeanor. He's bright, he watches everything and out of everyone is really is the most skilled when it comes to tracking things down or playing life like it's a poker game. He's a little on the dangerous side, being from a family of assassins but, he forms a very close bond to Gon very early on and becomes extremely loyal.I noticed a lot of reviews mentioning the artwork... Togashi started this not to long after Yu Yu Hakusho, and he had some health issues during the final stages of the series that made it hard for him to illustrate sometimes. I think the inconsistencies may be due to that, and they disappear rather quickly as the series progresses.",

                "review/text": "This second volume in Pullman's epic trilogy is closer in tone to JRR Tolkien than JK Rowling, but religion and philosophy take center stage early on. This battle of Good versus Evil has Pullman update Milton and Blake by questioning a LOT of assumptions.With the Catholic Church scandal revealing painful new developments every day, Pullman's work becomes ever more timely. Are institutions created to teach morality capable of staying moral? Can moral authorities resist authoritarianism? Which is more important, the integrity of the institution or protecting our most vulnerable citizens? All these issues come to fore, and in _The Subtle Knife_, the question of whether religion elevates or crushes the soul is never far from one's mind.The previous novel introduced Lyra Silvertongue, who lived in an alternate Oxford (UK) where everyone has a animal-daemon who stays close at hand. This volume introduces Will Parry, from our own Oxford, dealing with his incompetent mother and the disappearance of his explorer father. Will travels to a dangerous Mediterranean world where soul-sucking wraiths only kill adults, meets Lyra, and the two join forces. When Will discovers the Subtle Knife's power to cut portals between worlds, he and Lyra learn this is not only a method of escape, but an unstable force that could destroy many worlds.Pullman clearly detests the evil done in the name of religion. He is not necessarily anti-Catholic or anti-Christian but anti-authoritarian. Anyone who has studied European history will recognize the characterization of a corrupt and overly powerful Church (denomination never specified). Lyra and Will are bringing The Enlightenment to several worlds who are as politically forward as pre-Reformation Europe, and must defeat powerful forces who have no interest in yielding. The book and its companion volumes work both as a springboard to the Big Questions and as an allegory for growing up and finding one's own way.Literate, informed, evocative, and conceptually brilliant, this supposed Young Adult release will captivate adults as well.",

                "review/text": "When Dickens' novels were first serialized, anxious crowds gathered at American docks, waiting for each fresh installment from across the ocean. Readers of Philip Pullman's &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; have found themselves similarly looking across the water for its sequel, and after an eighteen month wait &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; has finally arrived.&quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; is the second installment in the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy, in which Pullman has created an alternate universe nearly as vivid and credible as our own. Whereas &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; was set in a parallel world in which bears talk and witches fly, the action of its sequel occurs primarily in our own world. The book introduces a new protagonist, Will Perry, who joins the heroine of &quot;The Golden Compass,&quot; Lyra Belacqua, in an eschatological quest for the nature of &quot;Dust&quot; -- subatomic particles which correspond to the mysterious dark matter of modern astronomy. Will and Lyra meet in Cittagazze, a frightening world in which spectres suck the souls from adults, and thus the only fear children have is of growing up.Reviewers of &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; made inevitable comparisons to Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. While it is difficult for any fantasy book to escape the long shadow of Frodo Baggins, the Dark Materials series admirably avoids the painful kitsch that so often mars Tolkien's work; Pullman's characters seldom burst into song or sigh as they contemplate a noble past where men and elves walked tall and... well, one gets the picture. Indeed, what sets Pullman apart from so many fellow fabulists is his respect for restrained, inventive language. For instance, the following passage describes a spell of invisibility: &quot;True invisibility was impossible, of course; this was mental magic, a kind of fiercely held modesty that could make the spell worker not invisible but simply unnoticed.&quot;I resisted the initial temptation to review the book immediately upon completing it; rather, I passed it off to a friend to compare her reaction with mine. We were in agreement on the verdict: &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; ranks among the best modern books written in any genre. It is that good.",

                "review/text": "I snatched up the Subtle Knife from my bookstore the very first day the book was released, eager with anticipation. Almost three years later, at 15, I still have not lost that joyous and excited feeling of delight every time I pick up the book. I originally reviewed the book long ago, but I came back to check what others thought about Philip Pullman's masterpiece. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. Readers seem to be criticizing Pullman for the religious aspects of his works and their apparent &quot;immorality.&quot; The fact that these absurd thoughts completely contradict the ideals of the pluralistic society we're supposed to be living in doesn't even bother me at this point. Readers simply fail to realize that the very nature of Pullman's work forces him to deal with these issues! The Dark Materials Trilogy is based on a single passage from Milton's Paradise Lost, which, as you know, deals with Satan's rebellion, original sin and man's fall from grace. And although Milton in his first two books of Paradise Lost portrays Satan as an almost heroic character, no one accuses *him* of blasphemy. In fact, he was a devout Christian, one of the greatest writers of the seventeenth century and his work is commonly upheld to be a great resource to and extension of the Christian faith. Pullman simply takes a few lines from Paradise Lost and explores the concept within them. What if God had indeed, created other worlds that we are not aware of? Pullman, with his immense genius and imagination decides to explore this question. What if there were thousands of worlds like ours, where every possibility of probability occurs? He manages to answer this question in a magnificent and skillful manner. His work needs not be marred by religious censure.Perhaps most important is the fact that Pullman's various religious viewpoints don't even go against the organized religion established in our world. In Lyra's world, the Church is a completely different entity. For one thing, the Calvinist church has taken over all of Europe. Secondly, the Church there exerts a type of social control that our Church hasn't enjoyed since the 14th or 15th century. Lastly, Lyra's Church is obviously as corrupt and sinful as ours was during the Avignon papacy and before the Counter Reformation. We apparently didn't think it was wrong to go and rebel against the Church and try to cleanse it, so how can we blame anyone in Lyra's world for opposing their Church? And how for one thing do we not know that the Devil himself has corrupted this Church? Pullman never says *our* Church is bad, he only implies that Lyra's is.The next troubling issue is the whole plot line of the fallen angels' rebellion. Again, Pullman is *forced* to write about this - it is, as mentioned before, what Milton's work was about in the first place. What if Satan has finally decided his army has been built up enough for another battle with God? Or, if he sees Asriel (who, as the reader from Pennsylvania so cleverly mentioned, might be an incarnation of Azreal (Death), who is Satan's son) preparing for a battle, and decides to send his support? There are other issues which critics complain about, but they've already been discussed in previous reviews and this is getting a bit too lengthy already =). At this point in the trilogy, we don't know Asriel's true purpose, we don't know what side Lyra is on, we don't know what is good or evil, in short, we can't judge. So please, from now on, try to see it from the viewpoint that Pullman is writing from, or at least reserve your judgement until the last book is published.",

                "review/text": "After speeding through the Golden Compass, one of the best fantasy books I had read in years at the very least, I could barely wait to start on the sequel. Unfortunately, it did very little to live up to my expectations.Nearly all of the charms of the first book--a unique and well realized alternate reality, an interesting and masterful reshaping of \"real world\" institutions into this alternate reality, intriguing technologies--were lost in the sequel. However, the biggest disappointment had to be what I consider the near character assassination of Lyra. Lyra, I thought, was one of the primary strengths of the first book. In the Golden Compass, we had that rarest of all things, a female protagonist in a fantasy novel who isn't some kind of patient saint or super warrior. She was selfish, brave, ungrateful, loyal, resourceful and something of a brat. In short, she felt very much like a real girl who found herself swept up in horrible events far beyond what any 12-year-old child should have to face and, while she had her failures, faced those challenges with resourcefulness and sometimes terrible courage. At the end, we had Lyra, betrayed by her own parents, her dearest friend dead, about to leave behind the sole protector she'd found--but who was facing this unknown new world and a war against her giant of a father because she felt it was right. It was a powerful image.So I excitedly opened The Subtle Knife only to find Lyra's quest nigh well abandoned. Will is a decent if underdeveloped character, but he's tremendously common. In how many fantasy novels is the chief protagonist a boy with a mysterious father who ends up having a destiny well beyond his expectations? Will as sidekick I could have born. Will as primary hero with Lyra abandoning all self-agency in order to play hand-maiden to the male protagonist I found trite and somewhat insulting. And the one time where Lyra dares to remember her own quest after the Dust she is immediately chastised for not making everything about her new man. And then Will's destiny wasn't even that interesting. Boy with magical bond with weapon discovers he's the center of the universe--it's been done dozens of times before. Lyra's interactions with her daemon and the entire plot of what Dust is was new. And why did Lyra have to become so dumb and horridly insipid? Where was the Lyra who led her group of Oxford children in successful wars against other children back at Oxford? Where was the Lyra who earned the title Silvertongue? Where was her rage at her father and her grief for her friend?For a series which prides itself at rejecting the dangerous suffocation of ideas by the establishment, it surely does prop up more than a few patriarchal ideas.There were a few grace notes. I liked Mary tremendously and Lee Scoresby's plot had some of the best and most heartbreaking writing of the series. Just after The Golden Compass I felt Pullman had lost the plot a bit and picked up too many cliched threads that ended up diluting what had been a creative series.",

                "review/text": "I read the \"Golden Compass\" trilogy a few years back -- can't remember why -- and thought I'd dash off a word or two about it, what with the movie coming out soon and all. The books follow familiar kids/young adult fantasy tropes: the hero is an orphan (the feisty, indomitable Lyra Belaqua) whose real parents (not actually dead) are both powerful figures in the world outside. Lyra lives in an alternate-reality version of our world, a strange mix of the medieval and modern worlds, where the Church-led Inquisition has lasted for centuries, but science has continued apace, although led for the most part by the dictates of the somewhat sinister, repressive Church.The first two books were riveting, mostly because the fiery young girl is such as appealing character and the fantasy elements are quite imaginative, however, the third volume is disappointing. To put it simply, the Golden Compass books are a thinly-disguised anti-Catholic screed, and though the first two books are quite entertaining, the third is a real drag. If you get pulled in by the story, you'll have to finish the series, just to see how it ends. Although I don't have any principled or prudish objections to Pullman's world view, I do think the narrative and the writing suffered greatly in the third book, where he pretty much just comes out and says what he feels about religion and the Church, much to the detriment of the writing. It's just not that much fun to read once the story becomes a political pamphlet; indeed, finishing the series was a bit of a chore. (Apparently the movie adaptation tones things down a lot -- won't parents be surprised when they get the books after having seen the film!) (Axton)",

                "review/text": "My goodness. I truly loved _The Golden Compass_. I was intrigued and excited by a work of fantasy, depicting the beginnings of a religious battle, in which _both_ sides were flawed. And Lyra -- deceitful, mischievous, wonderful Lyra -- who made her own &quot;truths&quot; so often, seemed set at the end of that book to explore and discover a truth all of her own, one far more complex, but at the same time more personal and therefore more true, than anything her cold, ambitious, dogmatic parents could imagine.In a terribly disappointing irony, _The Subtle Knife_ cuts away all of the moral complexity and religious questioning that made the first book so gripping, and lays bare a far-from-subtle anti-Christian philosophy that, in it's lack of originality and respect seems to do nothing but emulate the dogmatism of its main villains.Moreover, the beauty of the intimate connection between Lyra and her daemon, that made the dangers of the first book so heartwrenching, and that added such complexity to her character by giving us a sense of her own inner doubts and disagreements, as well as her longing for love and acceptance, is here pared down to a bit of timely shape-shifting and a few lines of unrevealing dialogue. It's like the souls of the main characters really have been cut away, and in their place we have cardboard subjects spouting trite propaganda instead of the really soul-stirring questions we got in book 1.In this book, there are none of the moments of fierce beauty, none of the stabbing pangs of doubt and questioning, that made the first book so emotionally stimulating. The whole thing seems calculated and cold. Even a terrible (and deliciously morally ambivalent) act committed by one of the main characters seems a matter for little more than an emotional pause and a few subsequent reminders. The character seems unchanged by his experiences. Untouched. His soul does not speak to us here.In the end, _The Subtle Knife_ is simply disturbing. It doesn't disturb in that intellectually stimulating way that great, subversive literature can. It is subversive, but only in the shallowest of ways -- it attacks what many hold to be true and good. But it doesn't do it in a way that brings up new and interesting questions, or really challenges believers to re-think. It just batters its head against a strawman of semi-historical, pseudo-theological fiction. Taken together, the two books have the feel of a greatly crafted deceit, as what seemed so complex and profound in the beginning slowly falls away to reveal a simple matter of anti-religious sour grapes.I give the books credit for their entertainment value, and will return again and again to _The Golden Compass_, if only to imagine what the series could have become. But this book does for Atheism what books like _Left Behind_ do for Christianity -- they give believers a pat on the back, dissenters a headache, and lovers of literature a sigh of dissappointment. For a book that tackles such big issues, one would expect far more grace, far more thought, and far more subtlety.",

Having just read &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, I wouldn't of believed Philip Pullman could top himself, but boy does he ever. The second installment of the &quot;Dark Materials&quot; trilogy begins with the introduction of Will Parry. Twelve years old, smart, and fiercely protective of his Mother, in self defense he commits a murder.Consequently, this sends him on a wild chase that at its' end finds him face to face with our heroine, Lyra. What happens then, and how their individual quests are related through possibly hundreds of worlds is the heart of part two.I loved this book. I loved the addition of Will, and the beautiful friendship he and Lyra develop. I thought the action never let up for a second, and had no idea where it was headed. I also loved the focus moving from just Lyra, as it was in the first book, to ample time with all the other various characters. It made them more tangible, more easy to connect with.The only thing that's misleading about the book is its' reading level.The cover art makes you think you're about to read something lightweight and sugary. A fairy tale to share with the kids. It's not! I would love to give these to my nephew who loves the Harry Potter books, but don't know if he'd grasp all the concepts Pullman is weaving. He's constantly making you question who's bad and who's good. And maybe that's his intention, and it will all be clear in the final book. I can't wait. Cause this one ended as a true cliff hanger.",

A friend bought me this and The Subtle Knife for Christmas, so I didn't have to wait for the second book. I dove right in. I kept on loving it... until I understood what Pullman is really saying. You can defend him all you want, saying that this is just a book, the characters are fictional, get a life, and whatever else. But the truth is, Asriel is going to try to kill God, and Pullman approves of it. We know this because the lengthy passage about why the Fall of Man should never have happened is as persuasive as he can make it, lambasting God and the Church for--heaven forbid--imposing rules on people and ostensibly not allowing people to be individuals. Is this based on the actions of the fictional church in the book? Yes. Are we supposed to draw the very obvious connection between the church in Lyra's world and Christianity in ours? Absolutely. In the book, God--the traditional Judeo-Christian God of the Garden of Eden--is evil and must be stopped. And it is no accident that Pullman makes sure this idea comes through loud and clear. Some people seem to think that books somehow just happen, but I'm a writer, and believe me--they don't. They are carefully crafted, and if you're a good writer, you're writing because you have something to say. Pullman has every right to say that God is evil and should (and can) be killed. I also have every right to say that I completely disagree. I only wish there had been a stronger suggestion of this theme in the first novel, so I hadn't been in for such a tremendous disappointment. I thought the novel was a fantasy, with themes about independence, friendship, courage, even feminism--all of which excited me. When I discovered the religious agenda, I was crushed. But I am *not* saying Pullman has no right to include that in his novels. I am also not reading too much into the book--this is truly good fiction, and good fiction is meant to examined closely and not read only on the surface for the value of the story. Yes, this is a very well-written story. But don't mistake Pullman's intentions or miss the message he is trying to send.I am prepared for the barrage of messages decrying me for my &quot;narrow-minded&quot; views, but bring them on. I'm only sorry there this book hasn't sparked more of a real discussion over the themes of this book, rather than glorified name-calling of those who dare to disagree with the popular opinion.By the way, in case it makes a difference to anyone--I am neither a teenager nor a parent; I am 22 and I read these books while in college.",

                "review/text": "As I already have stated in my Amazon.com review of \"The Golden Compass,\" Phillip Pullman's \"His Dark Materials\" trilogy is a fantastic, amazing, mind-boggling, exciting, moving, heartbreaking, brilliantly written classic at the level of Tolkien's \"Lord of the Rings\" (and believe me, I'm a huge Tolkien fan and I NEVER thought I'd be saying that!!). Also, it is important to reiterate that this is NOT a \"children's book\" in the sense that it is strictly for - or about - children (although certainly, it can be read by intelligent young people!), and it is absolutely not \"fantasy\" in the usual sense of the word (Phillip Pullman has stated that he can't read \"fantasy\" books, because they don't \"tell [him] anything interesting about being a human being\"). Instead, this trilogy is Phillip Pullman's dark take on Biblical Creation and an extended riff on many of the themes raised in John Milton's \"Paradise Lost.\" The bottom line: if Phillip Pullman is mainly \"fantasy\" for children, than so are John Milton and the Bible! I don't think so....Anyway, the second book in Pullman's trilogy, \"The Subtle Knife,\" continues his exploration of themes like courage, love, free will, sin, God, the Church, and, of course, swirling around all of this, the ever-mysterious dark matter, or \"dust.\" Plus, the terrifying Mrs. Coulter is back, as are many of the other characters we have become acquainted with in Book 1 (plus some new ones too, especially former nun and current \"dark matter\" scientist, Dr. Mary Malone). And just as the \"The Golden Compass,\" can be thought of as being about Lyra (and her beloved daemon, Pantalaimon), \"The Subtle Knife\" is mainly about a powerful and fascinating new character, Will Parry. To my mind, \"The Subtle Knife\" is really the key book in the entire trilogy, and possibly the best of all. As soon as Will steps through the window into Citt&agrave;gaze, the beautiful yet terrible &quot;city of magpies&quot;, where only children and horrible soul-sucking specters live, Pullman's themes begin to really kick into gear. Perhaps the turning point in the entire trilogy occurs when Will gains possession of the \"subtle knife\" (again, a parallel with \"Paradise Lost,\" in which the Archangel Michael has a sword which \"was given him temper'd so that neither keen nor solid might resist that edge\") in the Torre degli Angeli, and learns how to use it, allowing Will and Lyra (his soul mate who immediately trusts him because he is a murderer!) to cut windows through into different universes (the knife has MANY more powers than that, including - possibly - God destroyer!), and opening up a whole range of amazing possibilities for this gifted author -- and his readers...All in all, \"The Subtle Knife\" is even richer, more complex, more exciting, and more mind boggling than \"The Golden Compass.\" And extremely complex morally, although some have (falsely) accused Pullman of being anti-religion (Catholicism in particular). But, really, this is NOT a simple book at all, and Pullman is a great enough author to basically leave it up to YOU to decide whether you agree with statements such as ''every church is the same: control, destroy, obliterate every good feeling.\" In my opinion, at least, Pullman is not preaching or didactic, but just laying out a view of things, which I basically find very satisfying, but which of course some will disagree with...To summarize three points I made in my review of \"The Golden Compass\": 1) this is far darker and more disturbing material (especially if you have a closed mind towards explorations of God, religion, the Church and the nature of man - all the interesting and important things, in other words) than the perfectly serviceable \"Harry Potter\" books, to which the Pullman trilogy inevitably is going to be compared (this trilogy is far, far greater than Potter!!); 2) Pullman is a master of language, and his use of names (among other things) is fascinating.. \"Lyra,\" for instance, is a constellation in the NORTHERN Hemiphere, plus of course \"Lyra\" sounds awfully much like \"liar,\" which is Lyra Belacqua's main skill (besides reading the alethiometer), and one in which she takes great pride. (Coincidence? Hmmmm...I don't think so!); and 3) Pullman has borrowed freely from this all-time classic poem by John Milton, \"Paradise Lost,\" in creating his own take on Genesis, God, Satan, free will, the temptation in the Garden of Eden, and the \"Fall\" of man into \"Sin\" (among other things). In interviews, Phillip Pullman has confirmed that the biblical Creation story, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and \"Paradise Lost\" are major sources for \"His Dark Materials\" trilogy, and that the title itself comes from the following quote: &quot;Unless the almighty maker them ordain / His dark materials to create more worlds.&quot; But don't forget that there is real science behind \"dark matter\" - scientists right now are investigating this as a possible sub-atomic force which could help hold the universe together!Anyway, I strongly recommend that you read Phillip Pullman's magnificent book, \"The Subtle Knife\" (and the other two books in the trilogy) whether you want a great story that you won't be able to put down, or whether you want to be challenged, amazed, intrigued, and deeply moved. And OF COURSE you should read it if you're curious to know more about the ever-enigmatic, but ultimately all-important \"dust\" (\"From DUST thou art....\").",

After restoring their new planet, the Thundercats begin the process of rebuilding their legendary society by bringing the refugees to New Thundera. But as the feline heroes look to the future, the evil Mumm-Ra allies himself with Slythe and the Mutants in a plot to destroy the Thundercats and gain control of their shared world. Armed with the Sword of Omens, Lion-O once again leads Panthro, Cheetara, Tigra, and the Thunderkittens against the Ancient Spirits of Evil in a final battle for New Thundera.",

It's all well and good to have a property grow up, but this is just sick gritty for the sake of being gritty. Some of our beloved characters get killed. Cheetara is raped daily. Wily Kit, a child, grows up as Mummra's sex slave. It's just disgusting. It's like an extremely bad fanfic, written by an overzealous and sexually frustrated teen. To add to this is how badly the sexual abuse is handled. Despite being ravaged for years, chained up in a mine, etc, Cheetara is drawn like a Playboy model. And not only does her body not suffer the torture, but she doesn't seem broken or mentally unstable like true rape victims are. Obviously, the idea of Cheetara being raped is MEANT to be sensual and to sell the book, otherwise we wouldn't be treated to full page spreads of her looking sexy in chains. (And people attack \"I Spit on Your Grave\" for glorifying rape... that was realistic in the horror).On the same token, Wily Kit, who is obviously at this point the product of child rape and molestation (by a frickin' MUMMY) seems trong willed and again, is drawn in a way that must be to make comic book fanboys go \"HEHEH!! Look, sexy!\"And to finish it up, later in this series, the Thundercats have to team with the Mutants against the Dogs of War. And what happens? Apperantly, the Thundercats forgive all that horror upon them, have a big celebration feast and Lion-o TOASTS Mumm-ra!? \"Cheers to Mumm-ra, who killed my people and raped my friends!\" I'm surprised they didn't have Cheetara giggle at the mutants sitting at the table and say \"So... my room later?\"All in all, a TERRIBLE, repulsive story and anyone who showers it with praise is obviously degenerate and has no true love for the original.",

The plot lines where laghable; bad guy does something bad, gets one over on the good guy for roughly fifteen to twenty minutes, then the good guys triumph in the end. It was never really clear why Mumm-Ra had to pick fights with the Thundercats, at least not to me anyway. But he did, and promptly go his but kicked each and every time. As a kid you really didn't care, the Thundercats were cooler than anything in real life so we tuned in every Mon-Fri, usually when we still had homework to do. Then the unthinkable happened; we grew up and the Thundercats were shown for what they really are. A silly, childish, little cartoon. It wasn't devistating, but it just fell by the way side.Some ten-twenty years later the market for 1980's cartoon series somehow becomes popular again and we are seeing the return of Transformers and He-man on the box and GI Joe gets a face lift in comic books and then look who's back, The Thundercats. Only this time they are alot more grown up with darker issues to handle. They have to save their people from slavery and genocide. They have to killor be killed, no more kid gloves and understanding for the bad guys. The audience that this is played out for are the same as in the 80's only older so the plot line must match the minds of the people who are watching it now. The problem is what was so wong in just keeping with the tone of the TV series. Sure we are now in a world were Tony Soprano is a hero and sex and violence is what gets and holds our attention. But when it is heavily implied that Cheetarah is getting raped on a daily basis by the mutants and Bengali is swinging from a wall hanged to death, it's just a little much. I know that it's a different time and the kids who read it now won't be as emotionaly involved with the situation but it was an unneccesary element. I know I'm being prudish but I think these types of series getting an adult overhaul just makes me want the series as it was on a Tuesday afternoon when it was innocent and just fun all the more.",

Third,this should be considered adult type stuff and should be put under alternate universe ideas and a child should never be able to read it, nor should a graphic that appeals to kids be on the front cover. I used to know people who actually wrote fanfic like this and didn't appreciate it much then either. Who at Thundercats HQ permitted this to even be published? Thundercats are not Star Trek, you know. I liked my Fanfic better and if something was unusual I usually classified it as alternate reality Thundercats at least. A better growing up story for the series would have been a new villian that could draw blood and maybe a marriage or something--which would be more appropriate for this type of fiction.

                "review/text": "PKD once described this novel as a &quot;turkey&quot;. It's not his best piece, but that judgment is a little harsh - he wrote far worse things during his career. Don't pass over this one.Granted, it's a little outdated. In the post-Cold War world, we might find an arms race allegory somewhat unnecessary. On the other hand, in our age, we're still dealing with megalomaniacal fascism, international espionage for sale to the highest bidder, and the possibility that empathy might yet save the world. I don't know about you, but I'm not so picky that I want to ignore all that.Just what, I ask myself, got PKD down about this story? My guess is that he was embarrassed by the heavily parodistic elements he threw in. That is, at a time when East and West struggled to build terrifying weapons with (we hoped) no desire to use them, PKD wrote a novel in which East and West actually make an agreement to build terrifying weapons with no *intention* of using them. At a time when the national police spied on its own citizenry, PKD described a world police without so much as a pretense of loyalty to any nation. The most important citizen of the West, its chief weapons designer, is at least as self-absorbed as any fashion star of today, laboring under the constant knowledge that he's a fake.In fact, the value of knowledge may be The Zap Gun's central theme. Knowledge of the facts is at a premium all through the novel, but those who have it don't want it, those who lack it don't know it, and at the climax those who need it can't get it because the one who has it can't give it without jeopardizing the truth of it. Rather than explaining that statement, I'll let you read the book - suffice to say that just about every character here is so accustomed to lying that they forget how to do anything else, and the only character who does tell the unvarnished truth is some kind of nut. Puts me in mind of the last few presidential elections.In short, many people of the 1970's suspected that government was in the business of putting one over on us, so PKD provided a vision of a future where government consciously pacifies the people with elaborate fictional war games. Which actually works pretty well until aliens begin putting entire cities into stasis and everyone's forgotten how to wage an actual war. Uh-oh.I did find one serious logical flaw - the various weapons supposedly don't work, being produced just to keep a civilian review board busy finding uses for their components in kitschy consumer goods, but toward the end someone puts those components together and produces a workable laser weapon. This kind of mistake isn't unusual in PKD, who often wrote so fast that I wonder if he remembered page 1 by the time he wrote page 200. On the other hand, by the time he wrote The Zap Gun he could, and did, handle suspense very well. His characters, while not as good as those in some of his other work, are sympathetic and touching. Maybe most importantly, he found a way in this book to humanize the political and scientific struggles of the day. Not many authors, or many people, can do that.The Zap Gun is often a parody, and sometimes a cheesy one. Like most of PKD's better work, it's also intensely moving and very funny.Benshlomo says, If this is a turkey, bring on the cranberry sauce.",

The book actually has practically nothing to do with its title, which was bestowed upon it because the publisher just wanted to publish a novel called The Zap Gun. But this is no science fiction spoof. It's highly humorous, but it's a serious satire on the arms race and techniques of political manipulation. Dick challenges the very notion of consensual reality, which is a product of mass consciousness, a lowest common denominator of belief that the media, moneyed interests, and the government conspire to perpetuate. Lars Powderdry is a \"weapons fashion designer\" who goes into drug-induced mediumistic trances to meet the consumer demand for new weapons concepts. None of his weapons actually works, but they don't need to in this society of \"pursaps\" (pure saps) who are unaware that all the new wonder weapons are nonfunctional and work only in filmed simulations. This is a terrifically clever work of trenchant irony.",

No press is bad press, as they say and he's banking on that. But none of that evaluates the result of his great idea of celebrating the cultural taboo, in this case being a psychopath. I wish a reader could give this book 0 stars. It's basically a lot of self-indulgent \"my view on the world\" writing. What a waste of time for the reader. This guy thinks that a PhD allows him to educate all willing readers to the state of \"the human condition.\" Wow, that's a pretty laudable goal, especially if he tries to accomplish it in one book and with only himself as the so-called \"expert.\" He states that this book will cause him to be banished him from the \"stifling\" world of academia. I don't know who he's kidding, but it sounds to me like only his ego ever fit in world of academia. This is just a book filled with jargon that will attract all the \"rebels without a cause\" out there, and incase they aren't convinced, he's thrown in some shock-value to boot and sprinkled the book with some drawings of skulls and crossbones and occult symbols. I'm not impressed. If you're a true psychopath, no one needs to give you any advice about your life or yourself since you know very well what you want; plus you'll likely not follow anyone's advice anyway. If you're looking for shock-value, I suggest a free televised episode of Law and Order SVU. However, if you want to know anything about psychopathy, read Robert Hare's (also a PhD) pioneering work on the subject. In fact, although he was the first to write candidly on the subject, many others have followed in the last couple decade and done some good follow-up work. All \"experts\" on the subject of psychotpathy have said again and again that being a psychopath does not hurt the actual psychopath, in fact it pretty much gives them an edge in most realms, such as business, politics, law, etc... It instead leaves a trail of trauma behind in their wake for others to deal with. So in his \"psychopath happy, victim unhappy\" message this author brandishes no new information. He just packages it with a little more ego and a lot of bad writing. One thing he fails to tell his readers is that recent publications on psychopathy have revealed that psychopaths DO miss out on a big part of life - they can't bond with another human being. Many report fellings of \"emptiness\" or feeling \"hollow.\" They necessitate a constant stream of excitement to compensate for the loss. They are utterly alone. It may be a condition to be feared, but evidently it may not be a condition to be envied. I do however, applaud the author's tact of coming out of the psychopathy closet. Wouldn't it be a safer world if all psychopaths so readily identified themselves to all those \"bleeding hearts\" out there \"burdened\" with a conscience? And, by the way, what's this guy's hang-up with Christianity? If you don't like Christianity (and there's a lot not to like, I grant him) walk away from it and find something else or just walk away. Big freaking deal. As long as he's still hung-up on it enough to do EVERYTHING THE OPPOSITE then he's, well, still being controlled by it. Oh, and you can't make yourself into a psychopath. (Sociopath, maybe, with a lot of help..) Just like psychopaths can't be cured and turned into \"normal\" people, to the great chagrin of many a well-meaning family member. So the little quizz or whatever it is at the end of the book is pretty silly.",

It is primarily compiled of three 'manuals' and three appendices. Nicholas Tharcher summed up the basic theme of the book well in the Forward when he said: 'In some ways this is a book of social philosophy; in other was it is a book of technique. Which it is for you may depend more on your attitude than anything else' (pg 15).The first manual is titled 'The Toxick Magician' in which very little is given that could be used for practical application and the little theory is a bit dodgy as it is not expounded. Thoughts are left vague and incomplete, perhaps to stimulate further thought and generated ideas on the part of the practitioner, but it looks sloppy and unfinished.However, I found the second manual, 'Toxick Calculator', far more entertaining. It deals with what Hyatt terms the 'mathematics of power' and contains more detailed theory, as well as exercises with more practical applications than the first. In it, the reader gets gems like this: 'We are inherently irrational, although we like to fancy ourselves as rational beings......the truth is simple: we are irrational beings capable of rational thought.' (pg 109)The third manual, 'The No-Where University, Sometimes Called P.U.' contains a selection of courses and literature, both printed and film, that a prospective psychopath will want to fill hirself in on in order to perfect hir transformation.Much of what is contained within one can see easily reflected all around, friends, co-workers, etc. Particularly in the games played by world leaders. Consider this extract: 'Build tension in others and help them find a scapegoat. Do this in small and insignificant ways until you have the power and ability to move people to more gross and hideous behaviors. Help people realize how easy it is to lose things they have or want. The trick in all of this is not to become identified as the bearer of bad tidings - unless you are looking for people with a strong stomach' (pg 87). Sound familiar?It's entertaining, an easy read, but at the same time insightful - though not terribly new. There is little that cannot be found within the works of Sun Tzu, Niccolo Machiavelli, Ayn Rand and the like. However, the ideas have been modernized, and deliberately injected with humour, which is fun. Then again, as he says 'I have written this book in the way I wanted to write it??not for the ease of the reader nor for the sake of favorable reviews' (pg 105).For those who have not read much in this genre there is a lot you need to know, namely, you need to understand that 'no matter how pathetic, everyone is looking out for their best interests. For most people, their best interest consists of not being punished. Few play to win. They play to be safe while feeling morally superior to the winner' (pg 31), and this is an attitude that severely needs to be corrected if you really want to play the game. This book just might help.",

And that pisses me off, because I had really high expectations of it. And that's not very surprising, since one of its authors is Christopher S. Hyatt - known to be able to write books that outrage the everyday citizen - and both the back of the book and its introduction promise the content to be highly explosive, more or less sure to turn your entire world upside-down, and the whole thing will probably be banned any day soon. Sort of. And who is able to resist a book that should be banned? Furthermore, it's published by New Falcon Publications, known for their great books on magick, the occult, and controversial knowledge.Ok, so perhaps I'm not entirely fair, after all, the book wasn't a complete disappointment. It did have its good sides, too. It packed with quotes about and observations of humankind, and most of them are just as comical as they are cynical and also true, even if it might be hard for you to accept the latter fact. Because Hyatt and Willis aren't afraid to speak their mind, they see most people out there as unnecessary, pathetic beings that the intelligent psychopath (that is, a human being who lives for himself, knows what he needs, and never hesitates to indulge in whatever pleasures life has to offer) both could and should exploit as much as possible. The word \"psychopath\" simply has gotten a bad reputation, according to the authors, and if you only know how to act then there's really nothing and nobody in the world that will stand in your way. In their own words: \"Other people's stupidity is your resource. Help them remain stupid.\"But, does this mean that psychopaths, as defined by the authors, are evil people? Yes and no. If it's evil to accept the truth and have the balls to take what one wants, then psychopaths are extremely evil. But on the other hand, much of what is being said in the book is quite redundant, and this is really the reason to why the book came out as somewhat of a surprise. Because, what the authors talk about is common sense, though perhaps described a little more harsh and in-your-face than most other help-yourself-books.It's definitely not as controversial as I was promised that it would be, and the exercises at the end of the book, designed to make you the best psychopath you can possibly be, is actually rather stupid. Silly, even.However, it was a good read from time to time, since it managed to mix the comical with the truth in an intelligent way. But still, a disappointment is never a funny thing, and especially not when it comes to the art of reading books.",

Lyra's search for a kidnapped friend uncovers a sinister plot involving stolen children and turns into a quest to understand a mysterious phenomenon called Dust. In The Subtle Knife she is joined on her journey by Will, a boy who possesses a knife that can cut windows between worlds. As Lyra learns the truth about her parents and her prophesied destiny, the two young people are caught up in a war against celestial powers that ranges across many worlds and leads to a thrilling conclusion in The Amber Spyglass. The epic story Pullman tells is not only a spellbinding adventure featuring armoured polar bears, magical devices, witches and daemons, it is also an audacious and profound re-imagining of Milton's Paradise Lost.

            {
                "review/text": "I'd like to offer a bit of dissent from all the raves concerning the Dark Materials trilogy.Let's begin at the beginning. *The Golden Compass* is a work of true genius, sparkling with inventiveness and carrying the reader on through its essentially absurd plot (do you *really* believe that any eleven-year-old girl, no matter how precocious, could accomplish all those things?) with fine panache and an unflagging sense of wonder. Don't stop to think, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Lyra, the girl from the parallel universe, is out to save her father from the captivity of armored polar bears and at the same time free her friends from the diabolical experiments of the fiendish Mrs. Coulter. What could be better?Book Two, *The Subtle Knife*, jars us a bit by switching the viewpoint to our own world, where Will, a young lad about Lyra's age, also sets out on a quest to find his lost father. Will is another full-fledged superkid, able to accomplish tasks that would daunt even Odysseus as he meets Lyra, interacts with all manner of bizarre beings and hops from world to world with tireless stamina.Alas, Will is never quite as convincing as Lyra, perhaps because he's so thoroughly grounded in our own mundane world, perhaps because his beyond-adult courage, wisdom, endurance and innate nobility are so utterly over-the-top (far eclipsing even Lyra's astonishing talents) that they begin to test the boundaries of our suspension of disbelief. Even James Bond was never this resourceful, and certainly never so remarkably articulate. There are some things that just don't wash, even in a fantasy. But all the same, there's action aplenty, and if you're not in too critical a frame of mind, *The Subtle Knife* makes for an enjoyable read.But by Book Three, *The Amber Spyglass*, Pullman's characters and storylines begin to explode in all directions, leaving us to wonder just which of the many players we're supposed to be rooting for -- and why. Multiple plotlines are fine, if they're kept within reason, but when the device is overdone, the reader becomes like a passenger on a fast-moving train, trying to look at all the passing landmarks but unable to concentrate on any of them long enough to really appreciate them. Maybe it's simple authorial zeal; but then again, maybe it's to keep the reader from looking closely enough to spot the ever-multiplying logical inconsistencies.Very quickly, the author's astonishing inventiveness begins to betray him as new concepts, magical gadgetry and otherworldly beings are piled on in such relentless layers that we very quickly reach the saturation point at which anything is possible and therefore nothing can any longer be surprising. Worse, many of them seem to have been invented as mere devices for hauling the characters in and out of the latest alarming predicament. Does the Intention Craft, to name just one, really have any purpose in the storyline other than to give Mrs. Coulter a way to escape from Lord Asriel's fortress?But most unforgivable of all, *The Amber Spyglass* is less of a novel than a thinly-fictionalized religious -- or should I say anti-religious? -- screed disguised as a fantasy novel. For Lord Asriel's intention is nothing less than to slay God himself and leave the multiverse the exclusive property of its wise inhabitants. This is somewhat complicated by the fact that God turns out to be nothing more than a drooling, withered, senile angel who gratefully evaporates when the two juvenile protagonists release him from his crystal life-support coffin, but Lord Asriel is undaunted. After all, there's still God's Regent to contend with, a lustful angel with a name (\"Metatron\") that would hardly be out of place on a Japanese giant robot.Of course with no God, there's always the thorny question of life after death, but militant atheist Pullman has an answer to that one, too. There is neither Heaven nor Hell, but there is a sort of Homeric underground afterlife where the powerless, whispering shades of the dead go to mutter to each other while harpies mock them for their earthly shortcomings.Not too appealing, you say? Will and Lyra agree, and after the usual superhuman efforts, they descend into Hades and free the dead souls. But being dead, after all, where can the shades go? Why, to oblivion, of course! They now have the option of choosing utter dissolution over an eternity of ghostly mediocrity, and just so we don't get the mistaken impression that this isn't really much of a choice, Pullman shows us that the dead are just deliriously happy to die for the second time, this time for keeps.I single this oddity out as an example of the author's relentless atheistic digs not because it's unique but because it's simply one of so very many from which to choose. Personally, I have no problem with atheists, but I can't abide *strident* atheists any more than I can abide strident religious fanatics, and *The Amber Spyglass* is one long atheist tract masquerading as a fantasy novel. Again, I emphasize that both atheists and atheist novels per se are fine with me, but when the ideology starts to overwhelm the storyline, it's time to bail out. Pullman's loathing of religion -- particularly Christianity, *most* particularly Roman Catholicism -- drips from every page, until even the most militant apostate is ready to scream \"enough!\"Whatever the characters are fighting *for* in this great battle against the All-not-so-Mighty, isn't entirely clear, since the multiverse still seems to be an awfully bleak and unappealing place after the Dust finally settles. It certainly isn't Love, because none of the couples in the trilogy -- be they Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter, the homosexual angels (yes) Baruch and Balthamos, or Lyra and Will themselves -- are allowed to come to a non-tragic end after their travails. In fact, poor Will and Lyra are cheated out of their hard-earned right to each other by a plot device so heavy-handedly contrived and artificial that we can only believe that the author was determined that there should be nothing remotely resembling anything as trite as a Happy Ending tainting the lunar landscape of his saga, no matter the cost to the readers' credibility. The \"tragic\" ending to *The Amber Spyglass* isn't so much tear-jerky as simply jerky.The *His Dark Materials* trilogy certainly is not, as the cover blurbs would have it, a new and formidable competitor to *Lord of the Rings*. It is, in fact, a kind of antimatter version of C.S. Lewis' heavy-handedly preachy Narnia books, but sadly lacking any trace of Lewis' charm. Fanatical Pullman fans will (and do) loudly proclaim that only \"fundamentalist Christians\" (aka \"religious bigots\") could possibly be disappointed with *The Amber Spyglass*, but in fact it's more like disappointment in a trilogy that begins so promisingly only to deteriorate into a rambling, unfocused, illogical rant in what should have been the climactic volume.My recommendation: buy *The Golden Compass*, and enjoy it without hesitation. If you feel that you absolutely *have* to see more of what's going on in Philip Pullman's sad multiverse, go ahead and get *The Subtle Knife*, too. But unless you have an unslakable thirst for obsessive antireligious tracts wrapped up in grimly contrived fantasy trappings that fairly groan at their stretching seams (and I know there are many people out there who do), don't bother with *The Amber Spyglass*.Well, if you *really* want to read it, I have a copy I'm willing to let go.

                "review/text": "I just finished reading this grand trilogy to my kids, aged 8, 10, and 12. My wife ended up sitting in on almost the entire series, and all of us were riveted from Oxford to the World of the Dead and back again. These books are incredibly ambitious: they set out to stitch together a religio-political history of the multiverse with deep, informed reference to physics, religious history, adolescent psychology, Nietzschean heroism, etc. etc. etc. The result, as I read it, is one of the most compelling indictments of church and state ever written for a broad audience. Author Philip Pullman concludes, without didactic hamfistedness, that the first purpose of churches and governments is self-perpetuation through maintaining the ignorance of their adherents and citizens. The greatest wisdom and joy, in Pullman's worlds, comes of full, mortal, bodily engagement with the physical world per se: with domestic comforts, food, sex, art, aesthetic involvement, work well done, craft, cleverness, etc. The well-earned consciousness of a human adult, earned through Blakean experience, is the crowning moment of all creation. Antithetical to this wisdom and consciousness is dogmatic narowness, asceticism, monasticism, self-denial, narrowness of experience.That this idea is dramatized through the adventure stories of children is remarkable. One could do worse than to say that the weakness of fictional biography is its narrowness, its dependence on the particular, the local, the kind of detail that is very difficult to universalize or even generalize. And the weakness of allegory is its didactic tendency, its broad-stroke enmity to personal meaningfulness except in the most abstract terms. What Pullman has done is to weave a sharp, poignantly-rendered, intimate set of psychological dramas into grand, almost scriptural allegory. As though Charles Dickens were setting Tiny Tim against the backdrop of the Old Testament. In this way, which should not be attempted by lesser writers, the touchingly naive and personal actions of a 12-year-old girl take on universal importance. Every minor petulance, every petty preference, every whim shakes creation. In this setting, in which cataclysm feels immanent and everything hangs in pre-apocalyptic balance, our little heroin's encounter with God himself feels simply a natural step in the narrative. How Pullman pulls this off, I don't know. By all rights this should be embarrassing, overblown stuff, but it isn't. It is emotionally raw, heartbreaking, and lovely. Just like life.I highly recommend these books for children with good vocabulary and their fixed-Daemon authority figures.",

                "review/text": "Let's face it: most books are terrible. However, many readers get sucked in by a great first chapter---and then watch in dismay as the rest of the book seems to be a slow slide into poor writing, contrived plots, irritating side stories.The Golden Compass was very, very good. Lyra was amusing, brave, and the surrounding cast of characters; the gyptians, Lord Asriel, Iorek.... It was an excellent book, with a fantastic ending. I highly recommend this first book. It is both satisfying and tantalizing---you can read just this book (which, frankly, I would advise) or launch eagerly into the next book. Given that several characters are left kind of dangling, you will probably do so immeaditely.You will be slightly confused when, instead of continuing with Lyra's story, we dumped into our world, or rather, Will's world. You're told way too much about his mentally disturbed mother, his missing father (oh, oh, THAT'S original) and watch with bland interest as he manages to (accidentally) kill a man. Poor Will.Magic appears in the form of a `window' into another world. That's convenient for lil Will. My biggest problem with the whole windows into other worlds and the handy *subtle* knife is that it means that Asriel's accomplishment is rendered completely unremarkable. You're expecting that Asriel is going to step into some marvelous world, the Northern Lights world.Instead, we barely hear about Asriel, and Lyra is practically abandoned so we can follow Will around. Will is a weirdly stoic, dull, uninteresting, unamusing and nasty character who belongs more in some morbid `literary' novel. And he gets PAGES of screen time. Since he managed to get the immensely powerful Subtle Knife (hint: it's far, far from Subtle) he effs off anyone who gets in his way.He effs off angels, even helpful angels, and basically sends one to his death. He offers no comfort to the grief-stricken angel who is left behind. The character of Balthamos, who added much needed sarcasm and humor, is effectively castrated when he promises to be nicer (hint: much more boring) to the irritating Will.Will is exactly the type of character that C.S.Lewis would have parodied with sly and biting humor. I hate Will. He is an immense bore, who quickly grows tedious in his continuous use of this all-powerful knife. He probably attended Experiment House.I realized from the first that Pullman disliked Christianity and organized religion. However, whether through poor writing skills, or the rabid rage that blinded him, the last two books totally dissolve. There are brilliant scenes interspersed---and then there are the hideously irritating side plots. Mary, the ex-nun, offers an idiotic reason why she left her religion. Basically, she falls in love, and decides that God doesn't exist. Her reasons as follows1. He just doesn't.2. It's more fun and convenient.3. Physics are more interesting.She also is the protaganist of a side story that creaks and groans and screams to any sensible editor KILL ME! Wheeled elephants, who are sooo cute in their wisdom and sweet, innocent ways, show what Pullman thinks the world could be like if people just didn't believe in God. Wheee! Mary's role as supposed serpent/tempter never materializes. Likewise, neither does Lyra's supposed role as Eve, etc.The Great Battle That Never Was:Little to no tension is built up when SUDDENLY we're expected to care about this battle. However, much more time is spent in the world of the dead, where Lyra and Will free the ghosts from the hideous, Hades like underworld. However, like obedient readers, we trot along.Then, WHAM, WHAM, WHAM! Pullman, in obvious desperation and frustration, kills Asriel, Mrs. Coulter, and Metatron in a scene that disappoints on every level. You keep waiting for Mrs. Coulter to pull of one of her marvelous and wicked schemes that leaves everyone else gasping in the dust. Instead, she turns all sweet and gooshy, swearing that she loves Lyra, and ends up `standin by her man' and expiring alongside Asriel and that stupid angel. Asriel is built up as a fascinating, amazing, cruel, brave and incredible character that ends up dying in this crappy scene. Ugh. Mrs. Coulter is completely given the shaft with this last minute redemptions that destroys her intricate character.Oh, and yeah, and God/Authority blows away. Yup. He blows away----you know how you turn a mostly empty bag of chips upside down, and the crumbs somehow end up all over your lap? Well, that's basically his end. 0 stars for this empty chip bag death scene that ultimately showcases Pullman's none too subtle message to Christians: just let God die, even he'll be happier!Basically, the whole last books craps out on everyone. Lyra isn't Eve, and the temptation never happens. The idea of Dust is explained, and the focal point becomes this epic battle against the Authority, a battle that never happens and merely is a vehicle for Pullman to spew out his trembling dislike of Christianity. Oh, and you thought that Lyra's great betrayal was betraying Roger? Nope. Pullman actually has to TELL the reader what the big betrayal is.I'm left with questions. Did this trilogy collapse because Pullman is a lousy writer, or because he let his rabid hate of Christianity muddle the story.Well, the Golden Compass seems to indicate that he can write well. However, the last two books just crumble under his attempt to show1. How idiotic Christianity is2. How smart atheists are3. How nice they are4. How Christians are easily fooled, killed by the smarter atheists, and generally, fairly easily defeated by the marvelous atheist heroes.Pullman can write well. However, he carries over crippling hatreds into his writing that just ruin the book. Frankly, if he managed to write the last two books as well as the Golden Compass, I'd simply suspend moral judgement and enjoy the books. I would disagree with his atheism---but I would enjoy the excellent writing.However, he couldn't restrain himself. He managed the Golden Compass, and for that, I am thankful. It was simply painful watching the slow, certain slide into oblivion and poor writing. It was rendered more painful by occasional glimpses of the writing skill that delighted us before. Certain characters, ideas and scenes are thrown like scraps to keep us limping on through the waste land.I am very sad. The trilogy promises much and then blows up in your face. Let's get this clear: I disagree with Pullman on many points, but was willing to forgo those points because I enjoyed his writing. However, when his writing disintegrates, those points simply grate louder.I exit, weeping.",

However, I have seen other versions of the trilogy, and I found that the paperback versions, printed by Knopf, are also wonderful and pleasing to the eye, which are printed with heftier paper than the Omnibus. The \"standard\" versions (the ones that cost 7.50 or so) are also great, though not as pretty as the other ones; they are, however, lightweight and tightly bound (I got those for my brother, who enjoyed the series).

                "review/text": "Philip Pullman's dark fantasy trilogy, His Dark Materials, ostensibly written for children, is actually literature of a much higher order. The title of the trilogy comes from a particularly powerful passage of Milton's Paradise Lost, the great religious epic poem whose central story is the thematic basis for this trilogy. Another important influence on these three novels is the Christian Parsifal or Sir Percival story, which dates back to the early middle-ages as part of both the King Arthur and the Holy Grail cycle of tales. From its very first page, Pullman's crisp, evocative writing creates a world not quite like ours but just similar enough to be uncomfortable and strangely familiar. As readers of the trilogy know, most of the events in these books do not occur on our world or even in our universe. Of course, because this is post Tolkien fantasy, Mr. Pullman has absorbed all of the usual fantasy tropes and has no desire to repeat them. So what he writes is new, deeper, with fully rounded characters that come alive on the page. His courageous young heroine, Lyra Belacqua with her daemon familiar, Pantalaimon, always by her side, is one of the great creations in \"children's literature\". Lyra and Pan make an especially entertaining, often very amusing, pair. Her fearsome Uncle, Lord Asriel, is one of those rich, ambiguous creations that keep you guessing as to their motives, reminiscent of Professor Snape in J. K. Rowling's Potter novels. Pullman's writing is lean and well crafted and exciting to read. Once started, it is very difficult to set aside.This three volume boxed set contains the books in hardcover with their original dustcovers. Their artwork is lovely. It also contains a map: a necessity in today's complex world of fantasy. The first volume, The Golden Compass, has been filmed and was recently released on DVD. The two succeeding books, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass, will presumably follow thereafter. This set makes a lovely gift for an older and mature reading child or an adult who still retains memories of childhood and all of its dark mysteries. Strongly recommended.Mike Birman",

                "review/text": "As a teacher and a lover of good books, I have conflicting opinions of \"His Dark Materials.\" For pure \"good read\" value, I would consider this series on par with the Harry Potter series: not great literature, but well-crafted and compelling. Unlike the Potter series, which borrows heavily from many different existing characters and works, \"His Dark Materials\" is pure and original in its imaginative scope. Characters are very realistic, each possessing the same mixture of good and bad qualites we all possess. The plot twists and turns in a manner that is completely unpredictable. For these and many other reasons, the series is remarkably realistic for a fantasy piece, but this is where my problem with the series begins.Like Judy Blume before him, Mr. Pullman and his publishers have decided to market very controversial material to minors without providing warning to parents as to just what the books contain. While Blume's books contain realistic and often graphic depictions of teen and pre-teen sexuality and other controversial topics of interest to young people, Mr. Pullman has decided to use this blending of realistic and fantasy elements to take on religion.I am not a religious person myself, but even I was shocked by the lack of respect and even contempt for anything resembling organized religion that Mr. Pullman displays in this trilogy (except Shamanism, with which he doesn't seem to have a problem). Ironically, the knife Mr. Pullman uses to skewer religion is anything but subtle. I could cite multiple instances of his treatment, but to do so would ruin a good story for those interested in reading it. Let it suffice to say that anti-religious sentiments pervade the series to the point that religion itself is the \"dark force in the universe.\" I found this premise fascinating, but then I am a thirty-something year old man who can enjoy a story without automatically accepting its underlying premise. I worry that many of the young people who read and enjoy \"His Dark Materials\" will find this literary Trojan horse so compelling that they actually rush to embrace the Greeks as they appear from within. Parents struggling to provide religious and moral training for their children are done a disservice when authors like Mr. Pullman write a book the purpose of which is to undermine those very efforts. For the record, I am not assuming Mr. Pullman's intent with regards to the intentions of his trilogy. I actually saw an interview with him on television in which he spelled out the anti-religious underpinnings of \"His Dark Materials.\"To sum it all up, I'm not for censoring anything. The story is a good one. I really enjoyed it. I just don't think it should be marketed to young people. It should, instead, be marketed to adults who bring some additional wisdom and perspective to the work.I understand that a movie version of \"His Dark Materials\" is already in the works. If you think the protests of the super-conservative religious types were loud when the Potter craze began, wait until the vast numbers of religious moderates join the fray when they find out what their children have been learning about God and religion in Mr. Pullman's wildly popular books. Let's hope the film industry is responsible enough not to market this film adaptation directly to children. Okay, I know I'm not being realistic. It won't be long before we see the assassin priest, decrepit God, and gay angel couple action figures in our local stores along with the picket signs of many good people whom Mr. Pullman purposely intended to insult and offend. They, of course, will look like narrow-minded, intolerant idiots and Mr. Pullman will become the media's latest downtrodden first amendment crusader. He will also be a multi-millionaire.Well played, Mr. Pullman.",

As such, it is always a joy to come across a book or series that engages all of us and ends with long conversations we all learn from. While I do not feel these books are age appropriate for my 8 year old, even with an advanced reading level, it IS for my 13 and 17 year olds. After The Golden Compass, they both fought over who would get to read The Subtle Knife first.Based on some of the reviews here, much of this series seems to personally offend anyone that is christian. It seems like anything that is threatening to their beliefs is deemed dangerous and negative. However, I think it is a good thing to have your beliefs challenged; it makes you use your mind, question things, and creates thought!I would much rather have my girls read something they didn't agree with and found distasteful than have their right to read what they want denied. I am grateful for the freedom they experience in our country and the opportunities they are afforded because of it--opportunities to read something like these books that will make them use their minds, for example!It comes down to this: If you are someone who likes to read, likes to be entertained, likes to use your imagination, and likes to think for yourself rather than allowing someone else to think for you, you will find value in this series!",

                "review/text": "This is by far the most engaging, intelligently-wrtten works of children's literature I have ever read. (And for anyone getting hyped up about the religious factor, please read this before you judge!) The prose is sophisticated (I would say this is for kids with a very good vocabulary, maybe a 9+), and the characters are engaging. And talk about action packed! Pullman always keeps the reader guessing, and the action always is intriguing. The books do have violence in them (nothing too gory, but there are some battle scenes with blood, and some characters die), so keep that in mind if you want to read it to kids younger than 9.A lot of people say this book is anti-religious, anti-God, atheistic, etc. Most of these reviews have obviously not read the series. I actually found The Golden Compass in the book closet of the Catholic school where I taught English Lit! This book for certain is NOT anti-Christian. It does not preach evil values, & it does not encourage children to kill God. The book has a lot of religious aspects: souls, angels, and spirits. This book IS anti-religious corruption, and it IS against using religion to justify evil. One review mentioned the book encourages female circumcision: so wrong!...what the book said was that religions have used faith in God to cause harm to many, including the cutting of genitalia! And if Pullman is an atheist, so what? C.S. Lewis was a Christian. Does that mean Jews, Muslims and Buddhists can't enjoy the Narnia series, even though its messages aren't parallell to their own religious values?One thing that I do like is that Pullman creates very strong-minded children for his main characters, especially Lyra. Despite having horrible parents, Lyra finds strength within to overcome seemingly impossible tasks with the aid of her daemon Pan. I like that Pullman talks a lot about how fear can destroy people and societies, and also on a subtle level, how technology gone too far can wreak havoc on the world. I also like that Lyra both respects and questions authority. She has a mind and a sense of adventure, and I love that she breaks so many female sterotypes.I'm re-reading the series now and am giving it to my 10 year-old cousin for Christmas. I know he'll love it as much as I do!",

Over the last few years, these were all translated into German and released in Germany, but not in English. That was really frustrating. Full Moon Press was going to release them, but then they closed shop. That was mind numbingly hard to deal with. Now, thanks to Harbinger Books they are in English and available right here on Amazon!For your information, the books in this series are:Book One:The HereticBook Two:A Scream of AngelsBook Three:A Tear in the SkyThe basic plot: The Templar order has been resurrected by the Vatican to fight the supernatural dark forces that surround us all. I don't want to give ANYTHING away here though.These books are a thrill ride of fun!Also, for those not into the digital side of things, the first book is also available as a paperback (from 2005, here:Heretic: The Templar Chronicles). Also, Joseph Nassise has announced on his website that there will be a physical Templar Chronicles Omnibus, but the exact details (publisher, etc) are unknown at this time.I recommend downloading/reading the first book, and if you like it, continue the rest of the series. BUT, don't read the product description for part three! It has a slight \"motivation\" spoiler in it. So, for those that like all of their mystery to remain mysterious, don't read that product description.So, download \"The Heretic\" now. Give it a good read!

Bad enough that the author rips off Katherine Kurtz's much better Adept series and combines it with a bunch of characters straight out of a Rambo movie. If he'd turned it into his own thing, that would have been fine. But he didn't. Instead, we get a mishmash of medieval Templar and modern military hierarchy that makes no sense (\"Sergeants\" in the Templar Rule were distinct from \"Knights\" and therefore, the rank of \"Knight Sergeant\" is an oxymoron). We also get the same tired old plotline of the Templars fighting the good fight against slavering, one-dimensional occult forces that are about as frightening as a Care Bear. The author tells us that Cade loved his wife and is a good Templar knight (apparently, Nassise tossed the original Templar vow of chastity right out the window). Yet, we see Cade break the Templar Rule right and left: killing a Christian in the very first scene, disobeying orders, leaving quarters without permission, mouthing off to his superiors, all things that would have got a medieval Templar expelled from the Order. He mopes about his wife, but we never really see what made the two of them so happy together in the first place. We're constantly beaten over the head with what a great hero and leader Cade is, yet what we get is your garden-variety, jerk-off \"maverick\" who treats his men like crap. It makes them look stupid and didn't make me care about any of them. The only vaguely interesting character, Duncan, has an ability that he never uses for reasons that he never explains. So, why introduce it in Book One in the first place? Yes, that's right, folks--this is part one of a series. You don't even get a complete story for your seven bucks and change.A few scenes show potential--particularly the interrogation of the Revenant, Stone's death and Cade and Duncan's travel through the Limbo place. Gabbi's helping Cade from beyond the grave, though way to deus-ex-machinaey, does raise some intriguing possibilities with an otherwise cannon-fodder character. Unfortunately, the author torpedoes all possible mood or momentum with some truly godawful writing--passive verbs, single-sentence paragraphs, incomplete sentences, important scenes (like Stone's death) told at a distance in flashback. You name it; each page is full of it. Whoever edited this book was asleep at the switch.It's a shame, because I really like the idea of Templar fiction and always hope to see more on the market. Unfortunately, the reality too often consists of bad research and bad writing that is so derivative of other stories that it takes all of the fun out of it. Give this one a miss; read Kurtz instead. She delivers.",

In fact, both are in English and reference the Knights Templar but that is where the similarity ends. The characters in Katherine Kurtz's novels have a deep spirituality which imbues them with certain abilities and that leads them to oppose forces that will harm the world and mankind. The characters in this book have a religious conviction that they feel entitles them to go out and whup butt. Fighting ghosts, spirits and demons with machine guns? Really? The characters are shallow, the plot unbelievable (if the Knights have been fighting the supernatural for several hundred years wouldn't they be aware that something more than standard issue military ammo is needed?) and overall I was very disappointed in this book. If you enjoy the idea of a Christian militia going out to kick butts and take names, you might be impressed. If you are looking for a good fantasy novel with a system of magic, spirituality, good and evil, pick up another book instead.",

It had an innovative twist on an old theme and I had some hopes for the author. I'm not quite sure where he went, but Nassise stopped as quickly as hi started. When I found that he had finally released another book, I snapped it up and found that the author had changed his style considerably over the years, but that he could still write an interesting story.Something is eating the modern Knights Templar, one commandery at a time. They have survived vindictive suppression by the Catholic Church, remaining hidden until modern times when they reunited with the church and become the militant arm of the church's defense against evil. Now, something that comes in the night can breach the defenses of a stronghold and entirely destroy the entire garrison, almost as if they were completely helpless. The remains left behind are badly mauled, clawed, and bitten. Something is playing for keeps.It was time to bring in Cade Williams and his troops. Cade is the kind of Templar who scares other Templars. He is violent, secretive, and pursuing a vengeance all his own. Badly scarred with an encounter with a demon, he recovered to discover the he had hidden talents - he could see the past of any object on touching it - whether he wanted to or not. And he can cross to the other side of reality. Now he has to find who is destroying the commanderies and why. And then put a stop to it while there are still Templars left in the US.What he finds is a nest of necromancers, allied with the same demon that murdered his wife and destroyed his face. He calls it The Adversary, and all he seeks is its destruction. They are hunting relics, sacred objects that will let them conquer the world. If Cade doesn't find the key to the puzzle the world will be enslaved. This task may be too hard for Cade Williams and his small army of loyal knights.As you can tell this is something of a potboiler of a novel. Something is always going on whether it is supernatural or military action. With guns blazing and spells going off you can imagine that character development isn't a strong point. But since this is to become a series, Nassise has the time to make Cade into something more than a killing machine over time. This is a good start, and it will be fun to see where it goes.",

The first book of this trilogy, the Butlerian Jihad, failed in the latter two areas but the plot was a good enough read to overcome those flaws. The second book was a step backward, with the same weak characterization, but this time not balanced by a strongly told story. The Battle of Corrin, unfortunately, continues the downward trend. As in the other books, characterization is almost uniformly shallow, which is tough to do since some of these characters we've seen over the course of several long books now. Those characters we've seen in prior books don't seem to have developed much and the new characters are mostly two-dimensional. The plot is weak, mostly an episodic narrative of battles among the three major groups at war (the humans, the cymeks, the robots). The weakness of the plot is exacerbated by the \"been there, done that\" sense of repetition. It seems the three books could easily have been combined into two, making for a more streamlined, less repetitive narrative. Not everything needs to be a trilogy (Tolkien be damned). Another flaw affecting involving both plot and character is that too many actions seem arbitrary or contrived, done more for a plotline than developing out of character. Some, in fact, seem wholly out of character or simply unbelievable. Finally, whereas the first book mostly avoided the prequel problem of rote action meant to connect the dots of later books, this one is rolling in it, filled with awkwardly introduced or clumsily handled events/phrases written in so the reader can go \"ahh, so that's why they call them xxxxxxxx in Dune\". Admittedly, it's a tough problem to overcome for any prequel, but seldom have I seen it so poorly handled.If this were book one I'd definitely recommend against starting the trilogy. But chances are, if you've reached Battle of Corrin, you're going to read it no matter what just to finish the series and see those connections to later Dune books. So all I can say is don't expect much, don't feel bad about skimming, and have a good book set aside to dive into when you're done; you're going to want to recapture a good read quickly.",

Wow, so this is one of the origins we've been waiting for?-\"A Butler serves unto no one\". This corny pun wasn't even clever the first time I read it, after the twelfth time I felt like puking.

There's spice in them thar dunes!-Omnius' \"multiple personality disorder\" Cyber-Sybil?-The retro-virus, Compound X, piranha mites. Muhuhahahaha! Is Dr. Doom collaborating with Omnius now?-\"Death to the Machines!\" No need to explain this one.-Agamemnon's battelship form is a \"demonic Pterodactyl\". He's a Dino-bot!-\"It's about taking the think out of the thinking machines\" Until he said this, Vorian was the one redeeming character of this series.

Yuck.-The worm jousting - this is a joke, right? WORM JOUSTING? Shaitan reduced to cockfighting? Don't believe me? Look at the cover of the book!The ending is absurd. All they needed to do was tie things up credibly - we know what the end result is going to be, it's the journey that needs to be fleshed out with some integrity. Everything is just way too easily, conveniently, and cleanly tied up, like they phoned it in. I'm willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy a light read, but this one was a bomb.The blame for this book goes beyond Herbert and Anderson, where were the editors? Seriously.Somebody please tell me this was all just a joke.",

                "review/text": "Honestly,the Butlerian Jihad Prequels are hit and miss to a large degree.The overall story is engaging and entertaining but not presented well,in my opinion.As the reviewer below mentions,the characters are all pretty one-dimensional and hard to get inside of.The novels seem to read more like a history than an actual storyline.Kind of like watching Gettysburg as a stage play instead of a film.But then again perhaps that was the intent.It does have a sweeping span to it,but it is more akin to short chapter-like Star Wars episodes than the original Dune novels.And to respond to some of the loose ends that another reviewer mentioned...As most of you probably know,Anderson and Herbert also intend to finish the Dune Chronicals with two more novels that take place after Chapterhouse:Dune.These novels are going to come directly from Frank Herbert's outlines before his untimely death.In Chapterhouse,it was implied that the Honored Matres and others were coming back to the empire because they were fleeing another power.It was never explained what they were running from.It would make sense that according to the Butlerian Prequels,since Omnius sent out the copy/probes of itself and \"uploaded\" himself into deep space,that the Thinking Machines may be returning to Imperium space after 14,000 years.This is also implied by a sequence in the novel House Corrino where a Guild heighliner accidently jumps out of known space and the navigator senses an intense hatred of humanity in that unknown area.That could be consistant with the Machines still being in existance.Since aliens or other intelligences have never been in the Dune dogma,this fits as well.So I think the loose ends will end up playing a part in the Dune finale novels.As to the fate of certain characters,it's rather refreshing to leave the story a little open ended as far as the Atreides and Harkonnen dynasties.Perhaps for the readers imagination or future novels/short stories.As far as being disappointed with the novels,I'm not.They are entertaining (if not somewhat predictable) and good reading material if you love the Dune saga.Are they on par with Frank Herbert's epic novels?No..unfortunately not.But these are different authors with their own styles and storytelling methods.One can't forget that.But I think the saga is still in good hands..who better to continue than his son?...and I'll still look forward to the next installment....",

Machine leader Ominius concludes that if current trends continue the humans will prove victorious as they keep recruiting new members with ease. Ominus needs a new weapon of mass destruction to change the tide so he introduces pandemic plagues to eradicate the enemy.The virus work extremely well. The machines feel victory is eminent. The humans make a last stand at Corrin, but they are not only reeling from the plague infested deaths, they are divided weakening them further. Jihad leader Varian Atreides claims rival Abulurd Harkonnen acted cowardly; thus both major houses are ready to battle one another at a time when unity is the only hope. Others have split apart seeking solace in enclaves by forming a sorceress based sisterhood and the Freemen of Dune. The future looks bleak for mankind.Dune fans will appreciate the final tale in the Legends of Dune trilogy (see THE BUTLERIAN JIHAD and THE MACHINE CRUSADE) that is based on references from Frank Herbert's original 1960s novels. The story line is relatively fast-paced (at least for a Dune tale), but also contains the typical mythos-religious blending that is a series trademark). The cast seems two dimensional whether they are human or machine (no Johnny Five is alive amongst this crowd) except perhaps the heated rivalry that adds depth to Varian and Abulurd, but only when they are together in some context. Still readers will enjoy the final act of survival prequels to the Dune dynasty.Harriet Klausner",

I will agree to a certain extent that these works are nowhere near as complex and well written as the original Dune series, and that Brian and Kevin seem to have taken certain liberites with Frank Herbert's vision of the Dune universe; changing certain aspects to fit into their storyline. That being said however, these works are an enjoyable read. As I said, these books cannot, and should not be compared to the original works, which are truly great works of LITERATURE, for these are not works of literature, but rather, serial novels designed more to entertain than enlighten. These books admirably accomplish this goal, and when viewed in this light, and taken for what they are, one can appreciate what Brian and Kevin are trying to accomplish. As a huge fan of Frank Herbert's original series, I for one welcome any continuation of the Dune universe, so long as the continuation keeps me entertained.Rather than nit-pick and scream that these books do a disservice to the original series, I would encourage all fans Frank Herbert's Dune to view these books for their entertainment value, rather than their literary value, and simply enjoy them for what they are.",

Don't get me wrong, it was a huge effort to get the stories right and to take over Frank Herbert's Dune story, however, something was lacking. I felt like I was being led blindfolded through a maze of stitched up brainstormed ideas. Caution though, SPOILERS BELOW (sorry!).1. The characters were too shallow and 2 dimensional with colorfully added titles like Supreme Bashar, Primero, Viceroy etc. Do we really need all that? It makes the whole book almost (God Forbid!) Star Wars-like! I could even start drawing parallels, Omnius is to Emperor Palpatine as Vorian Atreides is to Luke Skywalker?2. The House Harkonnen/Atreides feud started like that? Gee, and I thought my cats and dogs had better fights! A minor military disagreement that ended up as a murderous feud between the bloodlines? This was the feud that I was actually looking forward to finding out how it started. It ended up as rumors, gossips, myths and fables handed down through generations. Romeo and Juliet anyone? A plague on both their houses literally!3. The plague was only scratching the surface of the story. If Omnius wanted the humans wiped out, it would have been 100% mortality not just 43% +/-! I would have thought something more devious, like a gene-select bioweapon that targets selective genes like good eyesight, intelligence, body mass etc. Or something that targetted and killed off the females, so the males wouldn't have breeding partners and would die off naturally. But I guess the Dune universe had to survive somehow. The pirahna mites were a huge joke, I think they ran out of ideas.4. 20 years and the machines couldn't find a way to destroy the Holtzmann satellites that imprisoned them? Come on! What about some new faster than fold space ships? Omnius couldn't even develop that? If the Ixians could build no-ships, and Omnius couldn't, then it isn't as smart a thinking machine as we think it is! No wonder humanity destroyed it!(or did they? hmm...)5. Agamemnon was foolish enough to trust Vorian to remove his brain canister from his walker body? I really find that very, very hard to believe, seriously!Well, I guess through all that, we find out the origins of the Spacing Guild. How the Mentats were founded, although it was too convenient! The beginnings of the Bene Gesserit. And how Corrinos and Harkonnens are actually the same bloodline!Still, I'm looking forward to BH & KJA ending our eternal wait (torment) for Dune 7.

But these super-early prequels, thousands of years before \"Dune\", have started poorly and ended dreadfully.The dialogue is dreadful. Compare it - and the writing in general - to the dense, subtle prose of Frank Herbert. No comparison. This is the kind of writing you expect from wannabe's, not established authors.The plot developments are simply unbelievable. Almost every aspect of the later \"Dune\" mythology is the result of a stupid accident? Oh please. The different story lines do not all mesh well, except insofar as they represent lame attempts to establish \"what comes later\". Many story develops \"just happen\" with almost no logic or slow development.Characterization - with a few exceptions, such as Vorian Atreides and Erasmus - is atrocious. Completely incredible is how/why Abulurd Harkonnen changes heart at the Battle of Corrin, resulting in the infamous \"betrayal at the bridge\" we hear so much about later. We can nuke billions but at the last critical moment we refuse to sacrifice 2 million humans? Not believable at all, given how the characters had hitherto developed. People make decisions that are almost random and completely incomprehensible.There is an odd preoccupation with body parts and fluids and such along with the oddly overdrawn descriptions of people dying horribly and violently. The result is a cartoonish caricature that distracts more than it helps move the story.Finally - notice how the story moves almost too quickly, a frantic pace, short stocatto conversations without emotion so that *suddenly* this happens, *suddenly* that decision is made - the final conquest of Corrin really only takes up a handful of pages. Wow. Wonder how it happened? These guys barely take the time to tell us.I can't believe I spent good money on the hardback edition. What a waste. Should have waited for the library copy.",

The writing feels forced and rushed, the dialog completely inane, the characters stripped of any complexity. The villians are stupid and easily manipulated. The characters make rash decisions with vast, universe-shattering consequences but do not even pause to do a bit of soul-searching for the benefit of the by now befuddled reader.The sentences are often redundant and obviously barely edited, if at all. The book is readable, but the poor writing intrudes constantly.If you're a follower of the series, you might rent it from the library to find out how the conflict ends, but I'm not sure it's worth the 7.99.

I was a little bit worried to read it again because when you have good memories of something from a long time ago, sometimes it is hard to go back to them again. One of the reviews here sounded like the book was going to be really yaoi with lots of sex and things I wasn't sure I wanted to see and that it was hard to understand the new version. I didn't have any trouble understanding the new version, and if there is a lot of sex in this one, I missed it. There's no naked people sex in this book. Maybe in later volumes? It looks like a little bit of skin in the next book (I got that too), but nothing much. Maybe I am a little disappointed now! Especially since the guys are so cute! That is one thing that is different. I think the artist draws a lot better than they used to. Rieken-Seren is so beautiful. His face is like a dream. He is like a prettier version of David Bowie, if you can do that! Anyway, I really liked this newer version a lot. I had no trouble following it. So, I don't know why anyone said they did. It takes careful reading, but I like that. It doesn't seem to me that this is a book you can just flip through. You have to pay attention. If you do not pay attention, you will miss a lot. It is as if almost every little line has double meaning. It's a great puzzle and that interests me. It has a dreamy quality too, but it is good fantasy (more fantasy than science fiction, I think). The Avatar is Seren who is so gorgeous he should just have his own book by himself. Anyway, he is like a god to his people because he can draw on their collective life force and use it as his own power. But since there can be only one (sounds kind of like Highlander but it isn't), the evil Hierarchy of his world comes to Earth to find Liana, a little girl who is also an Avatar. (She's not that little but she is young). The Hierarchy must kill her or the Avatar can't use his power. Seren is working against the Hierarchy but they don't know. He is leader of the rebellion. When his people come to Earth to kill Liana he gets some humans to help him to kill the Hierarchy. There is a lot more to it than that and I am already reading volume II, but don't want to flip forward. It is a little strange about the fantasy in here. How did Sir Galahad get into this story? I really want to see how that works out. Oh yeah, he is cute too. This book sort of feels like manga, but it isn't. It is harder to read than manga, but I like that because I get more story. Some manga seems to take 15 minutes to read a whole book. I really read and studied this book a lot and got a lot out of that. This art is pretty like manga, but more realistic. That is OK to me. This book is not yaoi like that other review makes it seem. If you are looking for serious yaoi, you will be disappointed probably. But it is shonen ai a bit. Seren and D'mer are lovers, but you don't really see much. Anyway, this is my first review and I hope you like it.",

                "review/text": "Colleen Doran, A Distant Soil, vol. I (1998, Image Entertainment)I should preface this by saying that Colleen Doran's A Distant Soil is the first graphic novel I've read since The Watchmen, some thirteen years ago, and so I may be missing some of the subtleties involved. If so, mea culpa.I've just finished the first volumes of the A Distant Soil trilogy (at least, it's a trilogy as of this writing), and I've been trying to decide whether I want to continue on with the other two books in the series. Still haven't decided one way or the other. Doran seems to be trying (as Neil Gaiman says in his introduction to the book) to cram just a little too much into the space provided.The story centers on a brother and sister who have grown up in a mental institution-cum-research facility. Both have psychic powers, but are unaware of the extent of those powers, as are their keepers. The two of them, after a crisis situation, escape and are separated. They find themselves aiding two different (and possibly conflicting; it's impossible to tell) branches of an alien resistance force, along with an odd assortment of characters both alien and human, including Galahad (yes, THAT Galahad).There is, without doubt, a lot going on here. And once you've got a handle on things, you can probably keep track of it all, but it takes much longer to get a handle on things than it should. Again, Gaiman's introduction rings true here; Doran's work got better as she got older. If you're willing to get through the earlier parts in order to get to the later stuff, you'll find much to enjoy here.The problem, though, is that some of the failings persist until the end of the novel. Cuts in location and time aren't indicated in any way, and the segues remain jarring throughout. The atmosphere is minimal; a good thing in some cases when telling a story, but generally not so good when one is working in the graphic realm. (One of the things that made The Watchmen so excellent was Moore's constant use of atmospheric detail, which is lacking here.)Hard to really say. I liked it, but I still haven't figured out whether I'm going on to volume II. **",

One of the great things about this graphic novel, however is the unique blend of physic powers, realism and the traditional space odyssey along with a colorful cast. The plot in the 1st book isn't really 5 stars, but of course the characters are just being introduced as their circumstances, but DS1 serves as a necessary component in the long run. If you buy this for anything buy it for the artwork. Though in black and white, Colleen Doran is one of the best illustrators I have ever laid eyes upon, her artwork so intricately detailed you feel these people are real.

They are separated and Liana is approached by aliens who explain that she has very powerful psychic powers and they need her help. Their society is ruled by a single person (alien?) with very powerful skills at organizing psychic energy. This person, the Avatar, serves as a religious leader and alsoThere is a certain amount of disconcerting randomness here. Author Colleen Doran began publishing this series (its been redrawn for this release) when she was in her teens. This may explain why this book is the way it is. It is lots like a teen girl's daydream: beautiful drawings with lots of flowy lines, Galahad comes from the land of Avalon through a time warp and accompanies our heros into space among other plot oddities.So the plot is kind of stupid. At the same time it is extremely complex and twisting. Characters have complex motives and act accordingly. We see lots of politics. And it all makes sense. Within this random random world there aren't inconsistencies. There are things to figure out and a plot to follow.The drawings here are very nice. They are done in a very defined line drawing style. Every page is well done and also pretty: art nouveau flowers and rainbows pretty. Battles fought with psychic energy work well with this style of representation. The layouts are packed (in a good way) and there is lots happening on every page.I liked this but I don't know if it is worth reading in general.

The anti-coloring books continually ask questions about the child, her thoughts, her feelings, her visions. They are brilliant mechanisms for encouraging confidence and creativity. From a parent's perspective, the finished books become a window onto the emotional and psychological landscape of your children. What do they really think? What makes them angry?

An advanced alien civilization is trying to enslave the human race with minimal physical effort over a long period of time (2000+ years or so.) They appear to humanity and demonstrate acts of \"magic\" which is obviously technology advanced enough to seem like magic to undeveloped civilizations. They tell the humans that they're going to take away a portion of humanity to signal their return after an undetermined period of time, at which time they would rule the world. They also go in to detail about some other events to signal their return, such as temporarily distorting the sun's visible light spectrum. They then disappear, but not before they put some sort of genetic marker on a portion of the human population. Humanity progresses with some societies passing down stories of the amazing magical being. Fast forward to present day and the aliens return to abduct the descendents of the humans that received the genetic marker, now numbering in the millions, thereby fulfilling the \"prophecy.\"This is where the science loses me a bit. The marked humans disappear completely, leaving clothes & jewelry behind. I'm assuming this is some sort of teleportation system that locks on using the genetic marker, but I'm not entirely sure because the authors didn't go in to detail. Regardless, the humans are transported to a storage facility (another planet or dimension?) and held for use later in the series.The disappearance sparks a world-wide civil war, pitting those that believe the aliens are some sort of deity against those that don't. Many of the alien prophecies come true, the Sun's light disappearing, etc., which makes sense since they planned it all along.Nuclear civil war destroys the infrastructure of the world, much like why Skynet planned in the Terminator franchise. At the end the aliens finally reappear and bring back the millions they've had in stasis. They use some sort of neutron bomb/weapon to obliterate one side of the civil war--I can't remember which. The surviving side now worships the aliens as deities and they assume complete control over the Earth.I hope there's a few more books planned describing the after effects of this enslavement. What do the aliens want? Breeding ground, resources, slave species?",

It's a well structured, swift paced book that focusses on world events as well as on personal experiences of people. I could not put it down, even though I wanted to.The downside of the book is that (though cleverly hidden behind all the action) it still will be felt by the non-believer, that the authors are hoping to persuade people to their Christian believes. That spoils some of the uncomplicated fun of reading this. On the upside: for those who DO believe in Christ this will make the book a warm bath that will strengthen their beliefs.On the whole I liked Beauseigneur's Christ Clone Trilogy better, because it offered more food for the mind, appeared better researched in worldly matters such as the United Nations politics, and didn't seem so focussed on the conversion of people in the book and outside of it.",

                "review/text": "When faced with such a book, it is difficult to know just where to begin. If the book is taken simply as the first in what has become a series of mediocre but widely sold science fiction or fantasy novels, then the review can end here, stating simply that it is written at a middle school reading level with characters that are two dimensional at best. However, I have noticed that this book is looked to as something more than just a novel. It has become a part of the apocryphal literature of many non-denominational (and some denominational) Christian churches. For this reason, a more detailed assessment is needed.The premise, that a group of people gather into an underground resistance following the apocalypse to oppose the anti-Christ, is problematic. Theologically, the idea of a post-apocalyptic redemption through good works is contradictory. Protestant theology grants redemption on the basis of God's grace; good works are not considered in the equation. In Catholic theology, good works are the way to redemption, with redemption also possible in Purgatory. The book is decidedly not written from a Catholic perspective, thus Protestant theology must be assumed. However, if the apocalypse has happened, then the game is over. Redemption is no longer possible. Furthermore, if such is the case, why would anyone \"left behind,\" essentially the unrighteous, wish to battle the new ruler? Traditional Christian interpretation of the apocalypse does not allow for second chances, so what is to be gained? In a universe that has already experienced the final judgement, God has spoken and nothing done by man can change the outcome. The answer can only be that the book reflects the free form Christianity of modern suburban America, which is essentially devoid of theology. It exhibits no coherence, mixing free will with predestination, combining the doctrine of works with the doctrine of grace, picking and choosing from the Old and New Testaments as necessary or convenient. This leaves two questions: was the book written to specifically appeal to a group of people (a target market group) who would not be expected to ask such questions or are the authors simply ignorant of such matters? Depending upon the answer to these questions, the book is either a cynical, now successful, piece of marketing or a testimony to a modern atheological religion's attempt to create a modern scripture.From a writing standpoint, the book is fairly simple. The main characters are poorly developed and are quite unreal. They seem to be the image of the unrighteous as held by those who consider themselves above such people. Their motives are too simple, too transparent. Every plot twist, of which there are many, are either clich&eacute; or contrived. If Hollywood were interested, this book would make an excellent screenplay. As a movie it could be expected to be successful (though it still would not be very good) as it would lend itself very well to visual representation. There is a good deal of action, heaps of emotion, and scenes that simply beg for a visual image. In some ways, it's the religious equivalent of a modern romance novel - simple, unchallenging, and inspiring of personal fantasy (albeit religious instead of sexual).Regardless of critical reviews, the book can be expected to be a best seller. What its admirers seem to ask of it transcends style or coherence. They don't demand complex characters or plausible plot lines. They only ask for their views to be justified in print. Theology, eschatology, and all systems of classical religious study are abandoned in pursuit of spiritual catharsis. Reviews cannot be expected to change this desire. To say that this book is not worth reading seems almost gratuitous. If you know you want to read this book, go ahead and do so. If you are not sure, take a bit of friendly advice: leave it behind and look for something a bit more complex and coherent.",

I do not bathe myself in theological rhetoric, and so didn't think I would be overly offended or supportive of anything in the books. I did think I would be able to respect Tim LaHaye in the end, but after reading this bunk, I think his agenda here strictly financial and has no bearing whatsoever to impact people (Christians or non) in a positive way. He should be ashamed of himself for a number of reasons after printing these books, but alas, clearly enjoys the growing popularity these books bring to his bank account.These books prey on the minds of the feeble at heart and people who probably have a pretty shallow understanding of who God is to begin with.

                "review/text": "Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, Left Behind (Tyndale, 1995)So I figured after nine years, it was time for me to get around to reading the first book in the bestselling Christian fiction series in history, Left Behind. I had always avoided it, not because of the subject matter, but by and large books that break records tend to be writ large by those with the wit, talent, and grammatical skill of overly enthusiastic six-year-olds. Dame Barbara Cartland, Danielle Steel, Tom Clancy, John Grisham, Sandra Brown, you get the idea. Why should Christian fiction be any different?, I wondered. But despite all that, I dove into it.Expecting the worst may not have been enough. To call the book nave would be, perhaps, too kind. It uses the conventions of satire without being in any way satiric, treats its readership like total idiots, has all the spelling and grammar mistakes one could possibly want from a mass-produced piece of claptrap, and various other things, all of which I will attempt to make sound as tactful as possible below. But the bottom line, for those who would rather stop reading now, is this: plot's not bad, but execution is some of the worst I have seen outside self-publishing. Ever.Without getting into the theological aspects of the book, it is impossible to write a comprehensive review of Left Behind without at least glossing over some of the more interesting (and less Biblical) assertions made by the authors, the most notable being the Rapturing (for lack of a better term) of everyone under the age of puberty. Hmmmmm. Including the ones in juvenile detention for murder? Okay, we'll drop the point. After all, our society is based (wrongly) on the idea that people can't make up their minds until they reach the magic age of eighteen. At least LaHaye and Jenkins dropped the magic age to twelve, for which they must get grudging respect.But little niggling theological concerns are perhaps less galling than LaHaye and Jenkins' complete and utter inability to ascribe a mote of intelligence to any of their characters, and by inference any of their audience. Not being a Christian and a regular attendee at church, I can't say for certain what the average joe learns about the end times. But even without regular church attendance for the last number of years, I remember enough of the Revelation of St. John from Bible study back in the day to have seen all the major twists coming at least a hundred pages before they actually do. And yet his characters, including the wife and daughter of a fundamentalist, are completely oblivious. Writing a book like this as a mystery/thriller, it seems, was not the way to go. Or if it were, perhaps adding a couple of extras who might have looked like they, too, could be the Antichrist might have helped with the suspense angle. (They do attempt a move exactly like this, but way too late and way too ineffectively.)I spent at least a hundred fifty pages of this book wondering, \"where's the satire?\" It was, of course, absent; LaHaye and Jenkins are deadly serious about approaching this series as novels mirroring the born-again Christian take on the end times. And yet despite their seriousness, they embrace the conventions of satire with open arms. Their businesses are thinly-disguised actual corporations with names that, in other circumstances, might be considered clever digs at those companies; their characters' names are ludicrous without being prophetic, a favorite mechanism of Dickens and Pynchon; the characters are often overwrought (and, really, it takes a good deal of mastery of the dime novel to make characters overact ON PAPER!); the aforementioned predictability in the mystery; you name it. It's all got the surface makings of great satire. Which makes me wonder how cool it would actually be if, after the series is finished, LaHaye and Jenkins called a press conference and yelled \"April fools!\" But I don't see that happening, and neither do you.Fully addressing the spelling and grammatical horrors in this book would take a book-length review, so we'll just note their existence, sneer at them, and move on to the stilted dialogue, the characters (who are cardboard cutouts of the thinnest stripe) and their inability to relate to one another (aside from, one assumes, snickering at the silliness of each others' names in the background), the constant use of clich&eacute;, the stopping of the plot every once in a while to throw in some gratuitous moralization (but this being right-wing Christian fiction, I expected a three-hundred-page altar call; I was not disappointed), and all the other little pieces of amateurism that add up to this book being of such horrible architecture that its popularity is really worth weeping over for the lover of the English language. It is obvious, here more than anywhere, that people are more than willing to overlook fatal flaws in the language as long as they can understand the book's message. St. McLuhan has lost the battle once and for all, and sixty-two million copies of the Left Behind novels speak with the public's booming voice: the message is the medium.It's enough to make a body want to give up reading. *",

I thought the concept was interesting, but I found the characters uninteresting, the dialogue ridiculous, and the pacing extremely slow. Or maybe I was just blinded by my hatred of Kirk Cameron. Whatever. At any rate, my boyfriend of the time loaned me the novel so I could see if it was any better than the movie.The book does correct several things I had issues with in the movie. That does not, however, excuse what an incredibly terrible piece of writing this is. I read more challenging novels in the third grade. If you can handle Nancy Drew, you should be ready for this novel. The character development is practically non-existant. Characters seem willing to change their entire world-view over remarkably silly things, and with relatively little internal struggle. And (as was mentioned in a previous review) the margins are ridiculously large (one assumes in an effort to make the book seem longer).I'm not going to get into the theology - other than to say that I'm catholic, and I personally do not believe in a lot of things mentioned here. But live and let live I say (even if the book's authors disagree with me). What I couldn't stand was the incredibly disrespectful tone the book took towards other religions. I found the Republicanism offensive as well - because Chrisitian is not synonimous with Republican, believe it or not.It wasn't persuasive or accessible enough to be a good piece of religious propaganda, and the writing was too poor for Sci-fi.

Hint: drakasequels.html)DRAKON is the only standalone Draka book,the sexiest, and the least gory[3], so if you haven't tried the Drakaverse, this is the place to start.[Pause to read a bunch of old Usenet Drakon discussions. The standout is Jo Walton's thoughtful review; Google Groups.]Anyway, I can see the point of the various nitpicks, especially the one that sees DRAKON as a Draka fanfic, written by the author -- but none of them mattered, while I was reading or rereading the book. Drakon pushed all my right buttons, and, since this isn't a formal review, I don't have to analyze the book, nyah nyah. It's *terrific*, and I look forward to rereading it again sometime in the 2010's.________________________[1] The only argument I came across for this not being OTL, was a comment someone made that all the VN-era fighting was in Cambodia. Note, however, that both the NVA and Viet Cong are specifically mentioned. Did I miss another POD?[2] --but includes a neat reference to Niven's \"All the Myriad Ways\".[3] Even so, there are parts that are not for the squeamish.Happy reading--Peter D. Tillman",

                "review/text": "I found &quot;Drakon&quot; to be the best of Stirling's four Draka novels. It spoilt me for the first three books, &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot;, &quot;Under the Yoke&quot; and &quot;The Stone Dogs&quot;. The premise of these books is that a society based on slavery can remain stable without emancipating the children of slaves and without allowing slaves some form of political voice. Through brutality more reminiscent of Golden Horde, the Draka maintain their terrifying grip on their subserviant population. I find it a spurious assumption that a minority could use violent repression to ever permanently bring about the destruction of a people's spirit. The fourth book is a refreshing change from this dismal scenario. Gwendolyn, a lone Homo Drakensis, is the beast supreme. In an &quot;alien&quot; world, she takes ordinary humans in under her wing and ruthlessly secures her territory. Her life is a journey into the darker recesses of the human psyche. But the Draka are more animals of instinct than humans. They live forever, they lack intuition (that's their servants' realm) and are empassioned with intense materialistic desires. Through genetic engineering, they have recreated themselves as creatures without soul. Elemental. Pure. Evil? Ah... but what is evil? That's the true point of Stirling's series. I'd be frightened to meet someone who could read these books and not question their own inner nature. Lastly, don't read Drakon first. Its no fun knowing with absolute certainty that the bad guys are going to win.",

Yes, they are ruthless slavers who subject all of mankind to the whip and then genetically modify the human race out of existence.However, any group of people who control the killing in the Middle East and Afghanistan can't be all bad. :)I got \"The Stone Dogs\" as a free book at an army base years past. After this very alien book I decided to read the whole series of Draka stories.Drakon is a nice follow up to Stone Dogs and the rest. Gwendolyn Ingolfsson, a first generation new human from the Drakon timeline, is accidentally transported to earth in a machine that sounds a lot like the machine used in \"Terminator\". A normal human, Kenneth Lafarge, is a secret agent who has a mission to stop Gwendolyn. Ken is part of a group of humans who fled the Sol solar system after the Draka won the final war. His job is to stop Gwendolyn from infecting our Earth's time line.This book is fast paced and fun. It's a quick read. Kenneth Lafarge is aided in his quest by several New York police. For some reason this book felt like a cross between \"Stone Dogs\" and \"Law and Order\". That's not a bad thing. This reviewer likes both and it sort of works.Gwendolyn Ingolfsson comes to Earth with nothing and quickly builds an empire. The point here is our present prison systems are smart for keeping convicts from the internet.This novel isn't nothing like the Stone Dogs, Marching through Georgia, or the very depressing Under the Yoke. It's a fairly fast paced novel that's perfect for reading while on the beach improving your sun tan.I gave this book four stars. It's not original. However, it's a fun forgettable read. It's \"Law and Order\" meets the Draka. It works well.If you like the Draka you'll enjoy it.",

                "review/text": "\"Person from the present is sent back into the past and proceeds to use his knowledge of technology\" is one of speculative fiction's older themes - the best-known early example being Mark Twain's \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" and going on through classics such as L. Sprague de Camp's \"Lest Darkness Fall\" to a profusion of similar books of varying quality (ranging from excellent down through adequate, poor, drivel and Leo Frankowski) since then.Drakon uses the same concept, but the \"past\" is *our* present - i.e. the late 1990s. It's refreshing to see a new take on an old theme, and it's great to see it executed as competently as Stirling does here. In fact, Stirling seems to have steered past his usual flaws in this one; the man's writing at his best, and his best is *very* good.The bad guys: Stirling has always done bad guys well, to the point where they completely overshadow his generally-uninteresting protagonists. Drakon's antagonist, a four hundred year-old genetically-modified human from another timeline plus about four centuries, isn't incredibly interesting as far as personality goes, but she's drawn well and realistically. Her supporting cast include a couple of thinly-veiled redshirts of modern liberals (damn, I wonder what Stirling's politics are?), and various thugs with enough personality to work.Very unusually for Stirling, the good guys are just as interesting. A NYPD detective and Vietnam veteran, and an agent sent back through time and space to counter the Drakon, they have personality and character, as do their supporting cast. For once in a Stirling book, I wasn't speedreading through their scenes to see what the bad guys do next; in fact, the ensemble of good guys are probably *more* interesting than the people they're facing.The future technology is well-researched and interesting; Stirling displays a solid understanding of engineering, R&D; and marketing. And the plot moves fast. Stirling's not afraid to shake his world with major events, and the final sequence, in a blacked-out New York City, is among his best writing.Stirling seems to have an obsession with lesbian sex, and yes, there's some of that in Drakon... but less than I expected from a book whose title character is a bisexual woman. Plot-extraneous \"I suffered for my research and you should suffer for it too\", another bad trademark of Stirling's, is also lacking- in fact, there's none.Easily the best not just of Stirling's Draka series, but of all his work to date. Too bad there won't be a sequel.",

As far as complaints go, this was the only one I had when it came to Drakon.

Rarely has anyone in the alternative history field created so thoroughly consistent and awful a society as that of the Domination. In Drakon, he explores some of their vulnerabilities while continuing to elaborate on their incredible powers and evolutionary track, manifested in the traditional parallel universe/wormhole framework. His Gwen Ingolfsson is a fascinating monster, combination of Ilse Koch, Nicole Kidman (who could play her in a film version quite well, not that any studio would ever touch this series), Ripley from the Alien movies, and the momma Alien herself, with a little of the Wolfman and Frankenstein's monster and a dram of Dr. Strangelove and Michael Milken thrown in for good measure. A very highly developed and repulsively fascinating character, and I thought Stirling did a good job with the human and cyber-human characters as well. He does not let you wonder where he stands, but does make you think about what it means to be human, what freedom is, the price of order, comfort, intellect, gardening, and the like. And he tweaks a few relatively recent human celebrities for fun along the way as toadies of the Draka (I will not identify them; if you can't figure it out, you've been deaf and blind for the last twenty years.) I have become a real fan of Stirling's, for this series and his Island in the Sea of Time trilogy as well. Which means I am deeply disturbed, of course.",

                "review/text": "Alan Moore's *Watchmen* dropped into the mid-80's Zeitgeist like a nail-bomb, embedding white-hot shrapnel into fertile young minds, shredding long-held preconceptions about the genre, and, all in all, signifying a new level of maturity to the medium of the 'illustrated lit.' - or comic books, if you prefer - with its adult themes and meta-narrative complexity. *Watchmen* tore through the boundaries, building upon the template of the \"graphic novel\" as pioneered in the early 80's, and therein expanding the potentiality of it ten-fold...it threw down the gauntlet, cocked the hammer of the duel-pistol; it challenged artisans to ~step up their game~, evolve beyond superhero tights and Golden Age clich&eacute;s; it left a huge vacuum in its wake - and, as we all know, nature abhors a vacuum.Thus we come to DC's Vertigo imprint, a label intended for mature stories, and more specifically to Grant Morrison and his *Invisibles*, the self-appointed (and occasionally self-conscious) heir to the post-modern *Watchman* wake. Begun in 1996, during a widespread industry slump due in large part to greed and mismanagement, and concluded at the end of 1999, on the eve of the new millennium, *The Invisibles* sought to achieve the depth, breadth and influence of Moore's juggernaught, to give a greater perspective to the fringe-elements of contemporary society, to reveal/ridicule/rise above the morass of ~popular paranoia~ as embodied by the X-files, Fortean Times, David Icke and other exploiters of conspiracy theory... \"This is the comic I've wanted to write all my life,\" Morrison stated at the end of issue 1, \"a comic about everything: action, philosophy, paranoia, sex, magic, biography, travel, drugs, religion, UFO's...\" In no uncertain terms Morrison envisioned the be-all end-all illustrated compendium of out-there speculation, a kitchen-sink omnibus entailing all theories and systems, a 'hypersigil' that would influence/embody the outward reality it modeled itself on - and, hopefully, make our world a better, more entertaining place in which to dwell. For only with an open mind can we really reap the benefit of life's ongoing pageant, boogie down to syncopated pulse of the information era.Morrison lacked neither ambition nor energy in his resultant craft, *The Invisibles*, a seven-volume conspiracy-epic that begins here, with 'Say You Want a Revolution.' Does it succeed even moderately to its stated intention? Well, yes - albeit somewhat fitfully. For this volume, besides being the opening gambit of the whole affair, nicely encapsulates the heady potential of Morrison's material, the verve and style, as well as the excess and superficial assimilation that occasionally brings the whole thing into the perilous straights of pretentiousness, of under-compensated imagination-overload. It is fantastic, frustratingly vague, epic and tangent-flabby, a borderline-smirk to all its influences and to those influenced. It's like nothing else on the market - and that alone assures its position on the top-shelf graphic novel 'classics' space.*The Invisibles vol. 1: Say You Want a Revolution* compiles the first two story-arcs of the series: firstly, the initiation of Dane McGowan into the mysteries of the Invisible order, and secondly, the Arcadia time-warp continuation. The first story is arguably the better and more effective of the two, being a variation on the classic hero/fool's journey from wild agitator to learned acolyte. The art reflects the influence of the 60's that infuses Morrison's storytelling: the draftsmanship, inking, coloring and framing is highly reminiscent of the Ditko/Kerby et al. styling of the Aquarius-Era renaissance in comic books. The second story, Arcadia, veers between two dovetailing plotlines: the Invisibles journey back to the French Revolution to secure the 'psychic projection' of the Marquis DeSade, and find themselves trapped in the libertine's most infamous work, while the Romantic poets Shelly and Byron pontificate about literary influence (\"a cannon fires only once, but words detonate across centuries\") and cope with personal tragedies. This second story-arc gets a bit messy (literally), but also contains superior writing and art, and builds into an effective climax that, in the end, had me scrambling to collect the rest of the series. Morrison's hypersigil had me.A literati l'enfant terrible, the author packs his narrative with a mind-boggling assortment of allusions, occult references and outright assimilation. A short list (deep breath): Egyptian symbolism, Situationist propaganda, Rock n' Roll quotation, Irish mythology, psychological probes and split-personalities, Mind Control, Satanic sacrifice, Freemasons, Templar Holy Grail metaphors (including the head of John the Baptist!), the Tarot, UFO's, Alien paradigm-shift assistance, syntax-manipulation, Gnosticism, Aztec demonology, multiple dimensions, etc. etc. Literary references include Shakespeare (King Lear), Carlos Castaneda, Browning, Shelly and Byron, and most explicitly, DeSade's *120 days of Sodom.* Some of these influences are made obvious, some are revealed only via visual interpretation, and some reach the threshold of gratuitous - not all works as well as it could (envisioning DeSade as a contemporary anti-hero is a bit of stretch) - but, overall, the confidence Morrison displays, and the generally successful accruement of his various sources, lends *The Invisibles* the impressive resonance of the meta-narrative, the glamour-sheen of a work in tune to the reverberation of the Zeitgeist, more than ready to challenge its current state, insert the past into the present and therein shape the future mass-consciousness. Morrison claimed that *The Invisibles* would have the same sort of repercussions as the Sex Pistols, hence my review-title; I'm doubtful of this claim, given that *The Invisibles* still remains relegated to underground highbrows, but it ~did~ influence those who made *The Matrix* (striking parallels can be found in the hero's journey segment of this book) - and that cinematic epic, for better and for worse, has forcibly inserted hyper-referential meta-narratives into the cultural identity.It's easy to criticize ambition. Certainly this book is messy, occasionally pretentious, overly stylistic and a bit smarmy in tone - but throughout, Morrison's intent remains pure:\"And in my mind, I see the sun rise on a new and better world.\"Highly Recommended",

                "review/text": "Long ago, a friend who raved about \"The Invisibles\" loaned me this first book. I don't have very clear memories of it, but I remembered it as being very hard to read, and I remember not getting very far in it before I lost interest.Recently, due specifically to the influence of Warren Ellis's awesome series \"Planetary\", I've gotten interested in comics again, and decided to give \"The Invisibles\" a second try. I got a little further this time, but still didn't even make it past the first volume.The story seems promising; \"Big Brother is Watching, So Make Yourself Invisible\". The eponymous team are a gang of reality-bending Crowley-style sorcerors, fighting the mundane system of everyday life, and the sinister otherworldly monsters who control the mundane system of everyday life. The execution, however, is less than ideal. MOST of the pages are very jarringly non-sequential; on one page, the characters will be in a park, listening in on a conversation, and then on the next page, where you expect to find a continuation of the conversation they were listening to, they'll suddenly be walking along a riverbank, in the middle of their own completely different and unrelated conversation. On almost every single page I had to turn back, and check the page numbering to make sure I hadn't accidentally skipped something or pages hadn't fallen out of the book; if it weren't for the sequential page numbering, I would have assumed I was reading a bad printing. This could be a clever technique if used sparingly; in a comic book about \"hacking reality\", throwing in a sudden and unexpected \"jump cut\" between two pages can contribute greatly to the reader's immersion in the \"reality hacking\", but when it's done on every other page it loses that hook and just feels sloppy, like the author and artist didn't know how to structure a comic.One of the \"page cuts\" jumps from the beginnings of a fairly realistic fight scene to a super-bright, psychedelic scene in which a character is tripping out and talking to the ghost of John Lennon, which looks like a completely different comic, has completely different pacing and artwork, and is FILLED with meaningless text, which brings us to my next problem with \"The Invisibles\": there's WAY too much meaningless text. If you want to present a radical, reality-altering concept in your comic, that's great; try to do it with action as much as possible and with as few words as possible -- this is a visual medium, after all. If you need to throw in a few wordy bits, that's OK too (\"Planetary\", again, does a perfect job of this). If, however, you are filling ENTIRE PAGES with text so small that you have to go below standard comic font size and it becomes illegible, then you might want to re-think your medium and perhaps just write a book, or a really wordy animation, instead. It was after the third ENTIRE page of nothing but hard-to-read, handwritten, meaningless text that I gave up on \"The Invisibles\". And by \"meaningless\" I don't mean \"fluff dialogue that pertains to the action\" or \"cryptic dialogue that might make sense later\", I mean actually meaningless, gigantic word-bubbles of insane characters singing entire songs and babbling incoherently about things that have nothing to do with the plot, or meaningless stream of consciousness droning from characters who are tripping. All of this text feels like nothing but filler, and coupled with the jarring transitions between pages it makes \"The Invisibles\" look like VERY amateur work.One last niggling detail is that I couldn't really identify with any of the characters. The main character, a teenage boy named \"Dane\", is basically a carbon-copy of Alex from \"A Clockwork Orange\", but without the interest in Beethoven. He wanders around London with his monosyllable-named \"droogs\", indiscriminately stealing cars, smashing windows, beating people up, and blowing up buildings. It's suggested that he's very smart, but this doesn't make him any more likeable. The \"hook\" is that he \"sees dead people\", which might've been clever when this series was first printed, but after \"The 6th Sense\", \"Bleach\", and a dozen other stories with \"I see dead people\" protagonists, it just seems clich&eacute;d.I really wanted to get the same sort of \"reality warping\" experience out of \"The Invisibles\" that some of my friends have, but I've seen it done better a dozen times before, and the whole execution just seems amateur. When I stopped reading it, I was hungry for some REAL reality warping, so I sat down and read some stories out of the collected fictions of Jorge Luis Borges and felt MUCH better. I suggest you skip \"The Invisibles\" and do the same.Addendum: The friend who last loaned it to me told me that the first two story arcs were, indeed, horrible, but that it got significantly better after them. I tried reading it again, skipping over those first two story arcs and starting from the third, and it was indeed a much better read, and nothing was lost in having not read that first part. So, I'm upgrading my review to \"a fun read overall, but not something I'd be interested in owning\".",

In the first half, we are introduced to the eerie world of the Invisibles from the perspective of the young Jack Frost protagonist, with whom we can relate (obnoxious as he might be).But the second half of the book suffers from jarring time travel sequences, high gross-out content, arcane conversations, and a lack of sympathetic characters. The Marquis de Sade is, I think, *intended* to be such a viewpoint character, but I found him too strange and off-putting to have much sympathy for him. And the Invisibles themselves already seem to know everything.That said, I have to conclude that it's a very ambitious and engrossing book nonetheless. The high point for me was Jack Frost's initiation to the Barbelo and whatnot, at the end of the 4th chapter. That had me really hooked, despite the fact that things got less interesting as the story went on.I can definitely recommend this book to people who liked THE ILLUMINATUS!

This book could hold some very real changes of perception for you. As the young Dane McGowan/Jack Frost is initiated into the Invisibles, so are you, given small tidbits that the reality we're all being held to is only that way because it benefits others for you to see reality in this light. You create your reality, this book can and will show you that.

Don't take my word for it, start looking around, question aut! ! hority and what you see on TV, you might start to see what I mean. Grant Morrison has an eye that sees past all of this. If you really get into the Invisibles, it will seem like you're being let in on a very big secret. Admittedly, it can be a very cryptic and challenging read at times, but if you're willing to put in some effort, and research this work outside of this collection or the monthly issues, you may just start to find and see &quot;the big secret&quot; I've described.

It was written with intelligence and erudition. There is just so much concentrated input on every page, both verbally and visually. As for the politics- this is also strange, for I have come to very simular conclusions.

                "review/text": "The Invisibles is the only comic I've ever collected from first issue to last. When it started in 1994 I was a sophomore in college, and when it ended a few months into 2000 I was holed up in a soul-sapping corporate job. Regardless, during those 6 years I was able to get my hands on each issue, despite the fact that I'd \"quit\" reading comics in high school. But there was something special about the Invisibles, and it kept me coming back for more; I even set up a service with the local comic store so they'd hold each month's issue for me, and I'd come in every few weeks, grab them, and high-tail it out of there.The Invisibles, as a whole, is as important to the `90s as \"Naked Lunch\" was to the `50s, as \"Illuminatus!\" was to the `70s. I suspected this when reading the comic monthly, but now, years later, I know it for a fact. Unfortunately, it's doubtful more people will come to this realization, as the Invisibles is simply too big to fit into one handy volume, a la those aforementioned subversive classics. To digest the entire story, you need to track down seven trade paperbacks. No doubt this will stunt the virus-like growth the Invisibles would otherwise engender on the innocent minds of those who read it. This series can change lives; this has been proven and accounted for.\"Say You Want a Revolution\" is the first book of the Invisibles, and this early out, things are presented in more of a black and white/us versus them scenario; it is only in later volumes that writer/creator Grant Morrison begins to subvert and reveal the \"larger picture.\" Here we are taken by the hand and led into the underground and bizarre world of the Invisibles by tagging along with Dane McGowan, an unruly, teenaged Liverpudlian street punk who just might be humanity's last hope in the battle against the Archons, demonic enforcers of Order. The opening half of this book details Dane's initiation, and here we meet the cast of characters who will carry the series till the end.First and foremost, there's King Mob, a multi-pierced assassin excelling in physical and psychic combat. Next there's Ragged Robin, a sometimes-crazy redhead with psychic powers who claims to be from the future. There's Boy, the ironically-named black woman who's an ex-cop with all sorts of skeletons in her closet, and a black belt in every form of martial art to boot. And finally there's Lord Fanny, transvestite shaman supreme. Dane himself is a ragamuffin of a lead character; you'll probably dislike him for the first few issues, until the human is revealed beneath all of the cursing.\"Say You Want a Revolution\" begins with a quick pace, Dane being locked up in a sinister boarding school by agents of the Archons, and King Mob coming to his rescue with guns blazing. After that things slow down for a while, as Dane is tutored by the magically-powered Tom O'Bedlam. This section is good reading, as gradually Dane becomes a more likeable character, but the rest of the Invisibles disappear for a while, and some of the dialog (particularly from Tom) comes off as Morrison pontificating to his audience. It gets to be a bit too much after awhile.At any rate, Dane is soon initiated (which entails a jumping-from-a-skyscraper test that was completely stolen by the producers of the Matrix), and his adventures with the Invisibles proper begin. However, those expecting the slam-bang escapades hinted at in the early issues will have to wait; instead of more fireworks, the team (or \"cell\" as they call themselves) mentally project themselves into the past, to bring one of their own back to the 1990s. This Invisible of the past is none other than the Marquis De Sade, and this section of the book, complete with sideline discussions between Elizabethan poets Byron and Shelley, is undoubtedly the most \"literary\" comic ever written. Unfortunately, this story arc was also nearly the death bell for the series, so early into its run: sales dropped to negligible levels.The Marquis De Sade storyline is wrapped up in time for the volume's end, however we're left with one heck of a cliffhanger. And that's pretty much it. If my review sounds a bit negative, don't be fooled. It's just that these opening stories seem very static when compared to what comes later. I realize this was not only intentional but necessary; had the series began with the whirlwind events presented in later volumes, a lot of people would have jumped ship in confusion, and the series might never have been completed.Morrison's writing is his trademark bevy of ideas, one-liners, and profundities. Some of it can come off as a bit too self-serving (King Mob's conversation with Boy in the club, for example), but not so much as to annoy. The Invisibles in a way works as Morrison's autobiography; no doubt it will be what he is remembered for, in decades to come.The art, however, is where the trouble comes in. The Invisibles was plagued with a procession of artists throughout its run, some talented, some workmanlike. The closest the series ever got to a \"regular artist\" was Phil Jimenez, and he only lasted for about fourteen issues. Here the art chores are split between Steve Yeowell and Jill Cramer. Yeowell's art is a bit too scratchy and ragged for my tastes, but it gets the job done. Cramer's is a bit more \"artsy\" and elegiac. Both artists are fine, but future volumes boast great material by Chris Weston, Phil Jimenez, and the unrivaled Frank Quitely.This first book of the Invisibles is your introduction to one of the greatest works of the 20th Century (and I truly mean that). Once you read it, you're either in or you're out. To quote the phrase that adorns each of these collections: \"Which side are you on?\"",

                "review/text": "This seditious series is definitely comics' most bizarre example of anarchy from the U.K. A decidedly different sort of superhero group, as part of a millennia old secret freedom fighting cult, the Invisibles hide their very existence from the public; their only identifying mark, occasionally worn by some members, is the \"blank badge\" (a plain, round, white button-the slogan-bearing kind, not the shirt-closing kind). \"The only rule of the organization,\" as explained in one issue, \"is disobedience.\"The series follows a particular Invisibles activist cell made up of: King Mob, a bald, tattooed and multiply body-pierced tantric magician and master assassin; Jack Frost, a teenaged, foul-mouthed, psychokinetic alien abductee; Boy, an African-American former policewoman and deadly martial artist; Ragged Robin, a mime-faced, time-displaced, clairvoyant witch; and Lord Fanny, a glamorous drag queen and Aztec shaman.The series ran from 1994 to 2000, totaling 59 issues divided into three volumes. Fortunately, the entire series has been collected in the form of seven easily accessible trade paperbacks. Say You Want a Revolution, collects the first eight issues of volume one, which focus around the recruitment of Dane \"Jack Frost\" McGowan: the story begins in a reformatory where juvenile delinquents are indoctrinated into a life of mediocrity by extradimensional beings hoping to harvest their souls, and ends in revolutionary France where the team recruits the Marquis de Sade.Apocalipstick(issues 9-16 of volume one) is about Jack Frost's attempt to flee from his role as an Invisible and how Lord Fanny was indoctrinated as a shaman when still a young child.Entropy in the UK(volume 1, issues 17-25) tells the story of how Lord Fanny and King Mob escape imprisonment and torture by the agents of total Control. The next three books collect the entirety of volume two.Bloody Hell in America(issues 1-4) follows the groups invasion of a top-secret military installation in the New Mexican desert to rescue the AIDS vaccine being kept there.Counting to None(issues 5-13) deals with bad karma, time travel, and brainwashing, andKissing Mister Quimper(issues 14-22) covers a return to New Mexico, making amends with the past, and setting the stage for the final conflict between the forces of control and freedom, which takes place inThe Invisible Kingdom(this collects the entire third voulme, which ran backwards, from issue 12 to issue 1, counting down to the new millennium).Although presented as a mind altering, spy thriller, roller coaster ride of conspiracy theories, metaphysics, (often extremely) graphic violence and slightly less graphic sex, the thin veneer of allegory barely conceals the more commonplace tragedies beneath the surface that occur in the real world every day. The surreal scenery is simply a backdrop for the true goal of the Invisibles (both the characters and the comic book): to purge the dominant paradigm and awaken people to their own human potential (Grant Morrison actually envisioned the series as a magic spell of liberation). Having just reread the entire series from beginning to end, I am struck by the intricacy of the plot, and the way that events in the first volume of stories foreshadow and continually intertwine with later events. For the diehard fan, or the confused reader, you can gain further insights into this series by checking outAnarchy for the Masses: The Disinformation Guide to the Invisiblesby Patrick Neighly and Kereth Cowe-Spigai.Like the protagonist of Alan Moore's graphic literary masterpieceV for Vendetta, the Invisibles are true to their roles as 21st century Robin Hoods, redistributing the only wealth of importance in the Information Age: Knowledge is not only power, it is freedom. As people become self-aware, they become self-reliant, and soon they become unwilling to prostrate themselves before the trappings of authority. Grant Morrison is only trying to make Visible the unseen strings that subtly manipulate us all.",

                "review/text": "What makes the invisibles such a powerful story are the characters and how they relate to each other. When the character relationships aren't in flux, attention wanders. I think that the series improves when King Mob throws his guns away and things get extra whacky. Many other reviewers have accurately reported how uneven this first collection is because of the departure taken in the time travel arc. The story shifts its focus onto characters who are not so easy to relate to.When the Invisibles is really firing on all cylinders, the situations the characters face are instantly familiar, but the reactions and commentary are fresh and inspiring. Check out the middle of the comic's run. That's five trade paperbacks. I know, it's a lot but it goes fast.Some outstanding aspects of the book that many others have mentioned are its some-of-everthing inclusion of popular cultural references, storytelling tone, varying art quality, and its use of popular conspiracy theory. Morrison manages to find a place for the fantastic in a realistic world. Or maybe he's just good at writing realistic conversations in bizarre situations. A few, but not all of my favorite moments in the entire series--Why's King Mob so violent?-Silver age invisibles. A little comic geek fun-King Mob uses acid to timetravel, disable enemy soldiers, and see the future-KM visits his ex-girlfriend-Jack doing mysterious stuff while on the lamb from the rest of the team-amazing tangent stories. eg the life of a conspiracy stormtrooper, a terrifying choice for a deep cover invisible working as a royal butler.",

It's fun, it's smart, it's challenging, it's got some great art and even better ideas.... and it all begins here! Meet Jack Frost, a rebellious, disaffected teenager from Liverpool, angry at life, hurting secretly on the inside ever since his father left him as a child. Jack, destined to be the next messiah, is recruited by the Invisibles, an underground band of rebels and terrorists dedicated to the ideal of freedom. The Invisibles force Jack to crack open the shell of hate and apathy he has built around his heart and let the world in a little. In the Invisibles' company, Jack is abducted by aliens, travels back in time, and is brutalized by one of their enemies, a demonic agent of the evil, extra-dimensional Outer Church.The first arc of the volume is almost entirely devoted to Jack's development as a character. Although still angry and self-centered, the seeds of self-realization and true compassion have been planted within him. In the second arc, Morrison plays around with the rest of the cast--the ultra-cool assassin King Mob; the psychic witch Ragged Robin; the ex-cop (and female) Boy; and the Brazilian transvestite shaman Lord Fanny. Using time travel, the Invisibles are transported to the French Revolution, which Morrison subtly uses to show the dark side of rebellion.The Invisibles is certainly Morrison's best work yet and this volume has all the reasons why: strong characterization, insane ideas, irresistible dialogue, and refreshing originality. Morrison takes his cues from no one--he leads the way.",

                "review/text": "I just finished reading the entire 7 volume series and I'm not entirely sure if I like it or not. The Invisibles raises many fascinating issues and makes us question our beliefs and perceptions of reality. I like that part. I've spent a lifetime studying topics such as religion, mythology, and mysticism; everything from new age to gnosticism to kabbalah to buddhism to conspiracy theories, et al. This series definitely addresses my interests.My only reservation is that the series got a little hard to follow towards the end. So many little subplots going on in the past, present, and future, in hyperdimensions, in alternate realities/universes, in dreams, in hallucinations; characters changing allegiances or turning out to be other than what they appeared to be; hidden agendas.Yikes, I got confused and more unsettled than a boy scout lost on Brokeback Mountain. I didn't know what was real and what wasn't, anymore. And I suppose that was Morrison's intent all along. The bastard! If Grant Morrsion is as twisted as his story lines, he can swallow a nail and poop out a cork screw.Like Neil Gaiman, his work demands several rereadings with new insights emerging each time. I'm probably going to buy that 364 page commentary by Patrick Meaney before the next time I wade thru this material. But wade I must, because I sense there's a lot of \"meaningful stuff\" that slipped by me the first time.",

                "review/text": "Lex Luthor has assembled the newest incarnation of the Secret Society of Super Villains and this time it's a doozy. The latest Society is legion in number having 314 members including heavy hitters like Black Adam, Sinestro and Solomon Grundy, small timers like Scarecrow and Cheetah II and completely obscure villains like Captain Nazi and Mr. Terrible (whoever that is). This is without a doubt the most impressive line-up of super villains in the history of comics and who stands in their way but a small group of six villains know as the Secret Six. This group, led by the mysterious Mockingbird, includes Deadshot, Catman, the new Rag Doll, Parademon, the daughter of Vandal Savage and some woman named Cheshire. If there seems to be a power disparity between these two groups it's only because there is in fact a massive power disparity. In their first assault on the Society the overmatched six are quickly beaten down, captured and tortured.Villains United is a much better series than the forgettable Day of Vengeance and it occasionally borders on excellent. Perhaps the most interesting part is the transformation of Catman from bottom tier villain into a credible and formidable fighter. In some ways it seems as if the writer was trying to change Catman into the mirror image of Batman and when he wears his black costume during the middle section of the book he's a dead ringer for the Dark Knight. The other part I thought was well done was the friendship between the new Rag Doll and Parademon. Because of his upbringing on Apocalypse Parademon is the only member of the Secret Six who actually enjoys the torture delivered by the Society. It's these little moments in Villains United that make the series interesting and fun. There is an actual touching scene at the end of the series between the bizarre Rag Doll and the violent, unstable Parademon that will likely stick with the reader after the book is put away and forgotten.Like the rest of the Crisis books Villains United concludes on a cliffhanger that's meant to be resolved in Infinite Crisis. A few villains die in the series, a few new ones are created and a few emerge as larger players. I'm curious to see how this gigantic assemblage of characters plays out as the Infinite Crisis unfolds.",

                "review/text": "Villains United is another countdown to the Infinite Crisis storyline that takes place in the aftermath of Identity Crisis. Like \"Day of Vengeance\" Villains United focuses on lesser known characters, this time villains who would are not even considered third-stringers (with the exception of Deadshot). Unlike Day of Vengeance, however, this book has a fairly comprehensible storyline and is paced quite well, even if the motivation is a bit flimsy.As the villains come to the realization that the JLA has tampered with the minds of Doctor Light and others, giving them magical lobotomies to erase their memories, they find themselves banding together for revenge. And this is the flimsy part...these guys have been on the receiving end of butt-kickings by the heroes for years. They've been tossed into prison, Arkham Asylum, and places far worse (in the case of Sinestro), and some have even been killed. But hey...mess with our minds, damn it, and we're coming after you!OK, that thin impetus aside, Lex Luthor gathers a ruling body of six to form a society to recruit all the villains on the planet to oppose the heroes. The six include Luthor, Black Adam, Talia Al Ghul, The Calculator, Dr. Psycho, and Deathstroke. Nearly all the worlds villains join...some willingly, some with a bit of coercion, until over three hundred are united in this society. Yet there are a Secret Six who refused to join and stand opposed to them. This group consists of Deadshot, Catman (who's been given an extreme makeover), Ragdoll, Para-Demon, Cheshire, and Scandal the daughter of Vandal Savage. They are commanded by the mysterious Mockingbird who has forced each of them to give their obedience by making threats against their family or other means, and have taken the House of Secrets as their headquarters.This diverse band of misfits soon finds themselves in direct confrontation with Luthor's group and as one might expect, the results are not in their favor and they are soon captured and tortured. But they show remarkable resilience and resourcefulness that even Luthor admires.Villains United does not feature one single superhero, other than a brief appearance by Green Arrow near the end of the story. While some may bemoan a series which features primarily lower tier characters, I found it rather refreshing. This can be a dicey prospect if not handled correctly. Writer Gail Simone infused each of these characters with life and personality and actually made you care about what happened to them. We certainly saw a human side to Deadshot that we've never seen before. The interplay between the characters was often humorous and witty. Likewise Dr. Psycho provided a great deal of comic relief on the Luthor side with his sadistic fascination with getting revenge on Catman for turning down the group's offer to join.While perhaps a bit improbable, Villains United was still a fun read and fit in well with the events that preceded it. The art by Dale Eaglesham, Val Semeiks, Wade von Grawbadger and Prentis Rollins was very solid without being overpowering. Along with the OMAC Project this has been the best post-Identity Crisis storyline thus far. Call it 4 1/2 stars.Reviewed by Tim Janson",

                "review/text": "Having learned of the Justice League's mind-tampering of several of their colleagues - most notably, the deranged Dr. Light - many of the DC universe's supervillains unite and form the Secret Society of Super-Villains for their own protection, under the leadership of Lex Luthor. However, not all the villains are eager to sign up, even with the threat of bodily harm. Six of these non-joiners even go as far as to form their own counter-team. This group, comprising of a lesser caliber of costumed villains and calling themselves the Secret Six, is ramrodded by the mysterious Mockingbird, a figure lurking in shadows who seemingly has his own murky agenda. The Secret Six's main goal is to undermine, combat, and eventually eradicate the Society. Hah! Good luck to them. The odds aren't very good...There's a Seven Samurai (or Magnificent Seven) feel to this mini-series as the underdog, undermanned and underpowered Six go up against Luthor's Society, which numbers in the hundreds and has on its roster high powered names such as Black Adam, Bizarro and Sinestro, each of whom can singlehandedly wipe out the upstart crew without breaking a sweat. I can almost hear Elmer Bernstein's rousing Magnificent Seven score in the background as the Six go about their way. The Secret Six, by the way, consists of the deadly accurate Deadshot, the duplicitous Cheshire, the new and very odd Rag Doll, the crude and pain-loving Parademon, Scandal (the daughter of Vandal Savage), and the revamped Catman. Only Parademon seems to be on the heavy hitter level.The Secret Six reminds me of the defunct Suicide Squad, which also takes the premise of banding together several villains to undertake against-odds covert missions. Unlike the goody-goody superhero titles, there is an escalated level of grittiness and tension here. Members have spats and the reader is never sure that these spats wouldn't lead to serious violence and even death. Most of the group seem to have no compunction against killing, notably Deadshot and Cheshire. Of the six, only Catman seems to be somewhat on the side of the virtuous, the others either ambiguously straddling the fence or being decidedly amoral and villainous. Who lives, who dies? It's really up in the air in this mini-series.This 6-part offering is of course one of the four limited series in 2005 which led up to the big 7-issue Infinite Crisis saga. The other three are The OMAC Project, The Rann-Thanagar War, and Day of Vengeance. There's also an added four-issue Crisis tie-in series featuring the return of Donna Troy. Villains United is my preferred series out of all of these. Expertly written by Gail Simone and artistically rendered by Dale Eaglesham and Val Semeiks, this is an engrossing story which doesn't necessitate any great familiarity with the characters and urges the reader to empathize and side with the underdog. I'm certainly now a fan of Catman; who knew he had such potential. And I've always liked the unscrupulous Deadshot, way back from the Suicide Squad days.Apparently artist Dale Eaglesham was ill in the midst of the project and Val stepped in and pencilled issue #3. But, no matter; the terrific quality of the art doesn't flag for one moment.So for a good PG-13 read, get yourself some Villains United. And here's hoping the Secret Six continues on. There's already another mini-series out about them. Go, Catman!!",

                "review/text": "When the one-shot \"Countdown To Infinite Crisis\" came out back in 2005, a couple months after theIdentity Crisis (DC Comics)finale, it started a pattern that would continue on with a host of DC's biggest projects and events over the next year or so - taking big, immediate-appeal concepts that often hit across the DC Universe, and then often having these events spearheaded by characters who were certainly less-than-obvious picks. Countdown To Infinite Crisis officially ignited the post-Identity Crisis happenings and served as a prelude to Villains United as well as toDay of Vengeance (Countdown to Infinite Crisis),The OMAC Project (Countdown to Infinite Crisis)andThe Rann-Thanagar War (Countdown to Infinite Crisis), and served as a major pivot point in the DCU. But instead of having the likes of Superman or Batman at the center of attention, that focus went to Blue Beetle, a character who'd seldom been seen in the few years prior, and whose heyday in the 1980s wasn't remembered by many as being particularly....memorable. But it worked tremendously well, he was the right guy for the story, and just as Day Of Vengeance brought in some highly unorthodox choices to lead the war against an insane Spectre, Villains United also went down that road.In Villains United, Lex Luthor has succeeded in pulling a vast host of the DC Universe's deadliest bad guys into a co-operative venture the likes of which the Earth has never seen before. With so many A-List villains in the fold, the spotlight naturally falls on.... Cat-Man, Scandal, Cheshire, Ragdoll, (a single) Parademon and Deadshot?? With the possible exception of Deadshot, and with Parademons usually only counting as big players when they're en masse, not exactly the characters one would expect to take an important - let alone central - role in this. Those six, though, don't even form a part of Luthor's Secret Society; in the series's first big swerve (this isn't a spoiler, the first issue of the six parter sets this up) the main group in these pages arguably isn't Luthor's Society at all, but a much smaller group of lower-profile villains assembled by an unseen mastermind called Mockingbird to take on the Society. Going by the name The Secret Six, the group is headquartered in a surprising location (I don't think this place had been featured prominently within the DC Universe in ages) and isn't even made aware of their ultimate objectives. Whereas Luthor's Society has been recruited at least partly through coercion, the Six have been brought together by more direct force, and have no choice but to begin taking on Mockingbird's missions.Meanwhile, the Society itself has an inner circle consisting of Luthor, Black Adam, Talia Al Ghul, Deathstroke, The Calculator (another unorthodox choice for such an important role, and one that would have been unthinkable before Identity Crisis revamped the character as a computer-inclined entrepeneur who doesn't plan out crimes of his own but who sells his organizational services and resource-gathering skills to other villains) and Doctor Psycho, plus it quickly gathers upwards of 300 other associates. And although we don't see all of them on the pages, we do see a lot, and they've brought in a ton of recognizable characters like Solomon Grundy, Scarecrow and Dr. Polaris, not a bunch of generic henchman-type villains. Although there are immediate benefits to such a united force, the ultimate goals behind the inner circle - or perhaps just those of Luthor himself - remain something of a mystery in the beginning.Some will be disappointed that the Society and its grand plan aren't given the total focus in here, with so much being spent on the Secret Six but I think it worked great and that it was better not to cram too much into six issues; much of the struggle between the Society and their collective 'good guy' enemies takes place in the tie-in issues to Villains United (Firestorm # 17; Breach # 7 - now There was an underappreciated series; Action Comics # 831; Superman # 221; JSA Classified #s 5-7 - seeJSA Classified: Honor Among Thieves, Nightwing #s 109 & 110) and much of it happens later, as Villains United was always intended to flow straight into Infinite Crisis.This tale is done extremely well, with lots of twists and a couple of Highly unexpected returns; it can be read on its own although having the 'tie-in' issues enhances and extends the whole series. Villains United works as both a vital piece of the extended crossover arcs that started with Countdown To Infinite Crisis and continued straight through that event, and, like Identity Crisis, did a great job in taking previously unused (or occasionally mis-used) characters and making important, interesting characters out of them. This isn't the kind of story geared for someone new to comics, but for somebody already into the DC Universe it's a dream project. Also recommended, in addition to the aforementioned 'Countdown' events (Day Of Vengeance, Rann/Thanagar and OMAC) areJLA: Crisis of Conscience (Identity Crisis) (Countdown to Infinite Crisis)andJSA: Mixed Signals.",

But if you actually want to be impressed by the Cat dude--as well as his teammates in the Secret Six, then Villains United is for you. The only thing is, Catman is somewhat upstaged by Deadshot, the former hack-Batman-villain who got his own revitalizing makeover in the Suicide Squad comic which also quite unexpectedly starred villains acting a bit like heroes while still clearly being villains but doing hero-type stuff while acting like villains as soon as they bump into heroes but often being heroes when fighting other villains who are definitely always villains until captured and temporarily turned into heroes alonsgide the heroic villains who caught them, and...it's all so morally ambiguous. I LOVE IT. What a great idea, as long as we don't jump the shark by having these villains become heroes. It's a tricky balancing act--keeping characters like Deadshot and Catman on a moral tightrope that holds water as well as it holds the heroes, ah-uh-oops, the villains. I meant villains. So far, it's working. And in Villains United, having villains we cheer for versus villains we boo and hiss at (though some of these creepos hiss far better than I ever will...but I'm not reptilian, either genetically or ethically).When Lex Luthor gets hundreds of villains working for him merely by extending countless polite invitations, he gets a bit of a shock when he is dissed by Catman, Deadshot, Ragdoll, Parademon, Scandal, and uh, who am I forgetting--someone hot, I know--oh right: Cheshire. When these supposed second-raters actually have the audacity to form a team to counter his master plan (well, okay, they're forced to, by the mysterious Mockingbird) then he really gets upset. So he sends scads of his new employees after Catman and his heroic band of backstabbing, infighting, grudge-holding, fractious, \"doesn't-play-well-with-others\" personalities. But beating up on the Secret Six doesn't seem to work, does Mr. Luthor discover. Capture/Torture shows short-term profits, yes, but long-term projections are stymied by a vicious, vengeful escape (see, there's the difference: heroes escape; villains escape while stopping along the way to be vicious and vengeful). And trying to keep the Secret Six from blasting their way into Luthor's stronghold proves that the best defense isn't going to work, so why not attack them in their own home as a really big finale, later, when they aren't expecting it.Some highlights: a traitor on each team; Catman and Deadshot just never quite getting along (several instances of them almost killing each other); anything to do with my new fave-rave, Ragdoll; Parademon's ambivalence to anything Earth can throw at him, be it torture, etc.; Scandal finally getting her gear on; Cheshire and Catman getting frisky like felines; Deadshot and Deathstroke facing off in a fast-draw; Lex Luthor asking Psimon a stupid question and getting a snappy answer.Obviously, this mini-series--now packaged as a graphic-novel extravaganza--was linked to various superhero titles as it unfolded, so a few scenes are out-of-place, no doubt relating to events in other comics. This creates a slightly patchy effect that rolls around at regular intervals and disrupts the flow. But in a story where the essence is controlled chaos, where heroism keeps interrupting all the delicious villainy at odd spots, perhaps this is fitting. Catman and Deadshot wrap things up by putting Green Arrow on the pavement and pointing a gun at him, and then walking away wondering which side they want to fight for. I think if these characters ever stumble out of the colourful Grey Area they inhabit as villains with nobility (but definitely villains!) then we won't get stories as splendid as Villains United ever again.",

Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset-those who believe that abilities are fixed-are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset-those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment. In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love-to transform their lives and your own.",

                "review/text": "I really wanted to like this book. It was Naisbitt's \"Megatrends\", and Peters' \"In Search Of Excellence\" that had initially turned me on to business/culture books that provoked interest and thought and dialogue, and helped develop personal growth.There is just so much to learn from someone as distinguished and experienced as John Naisbitt. In fact, Mr. Naisbitt does take his readers on a global tour as attendees of his speeches and meetings. And yet, there is something missing that (at least for me) created a sense of ennui and paragraph skipping. At one point I felt so guilty that I was not giving the book a fair enough shot, I decided to begin anew and retrace the first 76 pages to revive my personal mind set. It still didn't happen for me.For one thing, the book is a bit confusing. The majority of the book involves a description of 11 \"mind sets\" on which readers could evaluate past, present and future events. Fair enough. But the eleven mind sets were not especially insightful (e.g., Focus on the score of the game, Resistance to change falls if the benefits are real, Don't add unless you subtract et als.), and (too) often the examples were just too old/dated for too many people. (As a point of reference, I am nearing 60, and I am stunned by the lack of understanding of the historical significance of Viet Nam by bright young people under the age of 30. How, then, can many readers tie in the references to things happening at Harvard in the 50's, or when the author was part of the Kennedy Administration?).And, then the author tries to connect his eleven mind sets to future trends. This part was pretty sketchy. Frankly, the thought that we are becoming a more visual society than one in which people sit idly by reading the next great novel, or burying themselves in five daily newspapers is hardly a revelation. Nor is the fact that China is ascending in terms of world significance a new idea. Nor too is the prediction that Europe will continue its descent into an irrelevant continent of countries in which a significant percentage of people will be on economy-killing welfare programs, while the rest are so despaired that they do not sufficiently bear children to pay for all the social largesse, all the while hating the American model of capitalism, a revelation of any depth.Ultimately, I think that Mr. Naisbitt's Mind Set fails here because he has not kept pace with the height of the bar that he personally raised over twenty years ago. He references Megatrends (his 80's masterpiece which sold over 9 million copies) so many times, and with such reverence that I could sense that he was almost devining that you place Mind Set at the same level of distinction by association of his authorship. But, Megatrends was the seminal book of its time - so creative, so stimulating, and so important. Mind Set just isn't close to being in the same league.Since then, other writers have raised the standard of business/cultural writing with well researched books that certainly challenge and stimulate the readers. They have expanded on the lessons learned from Megatrends, and they do it better than Mind Set.As you can see from the other books that I have reviewed, I read many books in this genre. It is inevitable to compare/rate one book within the context of all the others that you have read, and, within this context, there are better books to read.",

                "review/text": "I just had the pleasure of reading an advance copy of John Naisbitt's Mind Set!: Reset Your Thinking and See the Future. There's a lot in this book that I'd like to recommend for those who think everything is \"the next big thing\"... It's really not.Contents:Part 1 - Mindsets: Most Things Remain Constant; The Future Is Embedded In The Present; Focus On The Score Of The Game; Understand How Powerful It Is Not To Have To Be Right; See The Future As A Picture Puzzle; Don't Get So Far Ahead Of The Parade That They Don't Know You Are In It; Resistance To Change Falls For Benefits; Things That We Expect To Happen Always Happen More Slowly; You Don't Get Results By Solving Problems, But By Exploiting Opportunities; Don't Add Unless You Subtract; Consider The Ecology Of TechnologyPart 2 - Pictures Of The Future: Culture - A Visual Culture Is Taking Over The World; Economics - From Nation-State To Economic Domains; China - Will The Dragon Devour Us Or Will It Be The Dragon We Ride?; Europe - Metamorphosis To History Theme Park; Our Evolutionary Era - No Next Big ThingEnd Notes; IndexNaisbitt, the author of Megatrends, came up with a number of mindsets that can help someone understand where things are going in the future. From that initial list, he pared down the items until he came up with what he felt are the most important eleven items that matter. These mindsets, if understood, directly affect how you view current events and interpret your surroundings. For instance, it's easy to look at each new technology and think that it will change everything. But in reality, the same underlying forces continue to drive people's lives. Business is in a constant state of flux, but it still ends up being all about buying and selling. In sports, the one-handed jump shot in basketball completely changed the look of the game in 1936, but the game itself was still the same... score a basket. Once you strip away the fluff and hype, it's easier to understand where the general flow of life is going. Or my favorite... don't add something unless you subtract something. Setting a cap on a situation (be it a sports roster or a number of menu items in a restaurant) forces you to weigh the merits of each item, keeping only the things that return value and dropping items that no longer measure up to the others. Something to remember before you make yet another commitment...Part 2 of the book applies a number of these mindsets to different current events and situations. Personally, I found this part of the book a bit more unfocused than the first. While I understand that the visual is becoming more important in today's society, I had a hard time staying focused on where the chapter was going. He does tie the mindsets into the conclusions he draws, but I found the mindsets themselves to be more personally useful for my own life.Definitely worth reading, even if you don't necessarily agree with him on how the mindsets play out. I'll be revisiting the mindsets a number of times to get them firmly embedded in my brain. And don't be surprised if I turn down some \"adds\" because I'm not ready to \"subtract\" something...",

                "review/text": "Before considering if you want to read Mind Set! please realize that this book is quite different from Megatrends, Megatrends Asia, and Megatrends 2000. Those books attempted to describe the key elements of the future world that were still new and unfamiliar at the time: That's the key task of futurists.Mind Set! by comparison, is a book about the methodology that Professor Naisbitt applies to take the information he gleans from local newspapers to discern the face of tomorrow. Mind Set! concludes with five brief examples of how to uses these methods.If you are looking for a futurist's view on 2027, this isn't the book for you.In fact, it's interesting that Professor Naisbitt has written this book at all: Futurist work and interest in it seems to be at quite a low ebb now.To me, the book's main weakness is that he says less about how to acquire the information he analyzes than in prior books. You have to wonder how long local newspapers accounts will forecast the future: The local newspaper business is dying. To me, it would have been far more interesting to have looked at how the blogosphere can be used to supplement or replace local newspapers for this purpose.What are the mind sets he uses? Let me paraphrase them so they make more sense:1. Unimportant everyday details change a lot: the fundamentals of life remain constant. His caution is to avoid getting carried away with seeing temporary trends as permanent changes.2. The future already exists: you only need to extrapolate from it. This is a hoary point that I assume he got from Peter Drucker.3. Focus on the score of the game: look at the actual measures. Politicians and newsmakers try to bend our perspectives away from what's happening. The key numbers tell the real story.4. Understand how powerful it is not to have to be right: massive failures follow those who blindly follow a doctrine (whether fascism or communism).5. See the future as a picture puzzle: assemble your perspective by seeing how a variety of current trends fit together. Don't rely on any one source to answer the whole question.6. Don't project ahead of what people can appreciate: otherwise, the new perspective adds no value. Seemingly, an argument in favor of blandness, this is simply the old test of connecting the dots.7. People will change to gain improvements. It's easy to overestimate resistance, in particular, to new technology that requires us to change our habits.8. Things that we expect to happen take longer than expected. Remember the forecasts of everyone owning a car-plane in the 1950s? We should be all using them by now.9. Breakthrough change comes only when someone can exploit an unusual opening, such as happened after the fall of communism. Those who try to solve problems through government action aren't going to be very successful.10. Don't overload people with perspectives and details.11. Evaluate technology in terms of the nontechnical constraints.In each of these sections, Professor Naisbitt provides his aphorism and a few examples. In most cases, I think you'll find the material to be suggestive rather than instructional in nature. If you already have a sense of how to do forecasting, that's okay. If you are totally new, I think you'll be a little at sea.About 60 percent of the book is then devoted to five future projections where he briefly mentions (one page on each one), the principles he primarily replied on to reach these conclusions. The weakness of this section is that the conclusions are so obvious as to make you feel like futurism is a waste of time. It would have made more sense to pick less obvious areas for demonstrating his conclusions.1. Videos, attractive designs, use of color, and visual imagery are replacing the written word as a key influence.2. Industries are organizing globally for supply, distribution, and production rather than by nation.3. China's economic growth will continue, to be followed by political freedom. The nation will become a global design and branding base, rather than just a source of low-cost production labor.4. Europe will experience slow growth, burdened with below-replacement birth rates, tough policies against immigration, and high social welfare costs.5. The importance of new technologies will slow down while the application of technologies developed in recent years will accelerate. Although he doesn't directly say it, biotechnology and nanotechnology are immensely slow methods of invention. He sees nothing else on the horizon that could cause a sudden shift. This is a good point. Generally, technology takes forever to move into mainstream application.After having read this review, I also think you need to consider what the role of the futurist is: Perhaps they just keep us from jumping on trendy ideas too far. That can be good. Most of the biggest corporate crack-ups I've seen up close came because the leaders believed the world was going to change faster than it did. They raced ahead to serve markets then that still don't exist.",

                "review/text": "Mind Set and the FutureI would recommend this book to anyone interested in the future, the present, or the past. Only someone of Naisbitt's stature and winning streak, when it comes to predicting the future, could make the claims he makes in this book sound so reasonable and so convincing. In the age of information overload, projections (the extrapolation of the present into the future based on received wisdom) are like rabbits in Australia; we do not really need more of them. Naisbitt, who is the senior statesman of futurology, goes straight to the essence of things in Mind Set. He develops a set of eleven frameworks that allows the reader to detect, observe, analyze, and react to future trends and five general directions that are in our event horizon. Not the projections, Naisbitt wisely pointed out, it is the Mind Set that needs to be elucidated!Back in the mid-Nineteen Nineties, I attended a lecture with about a thousand other people in an auditorium. We had all come to hear the author of Megatrends speak. At that lecture Naisbitt predicted rather nonchalantly that Japan was in the midst of a steady, slow decline. His statement was met with incredulity and would have been ridiculed by the audience, if the speaker of those words had been anyone other than Naisbitt. When an eminent Japanese friend of mine challenged him about his prediction, Naisbitt deflected the question with panache, like the pro that he was. Back then, Japan was still number one and it was easy to see why people at that lecture were having so much trouble with Naisbitt's assertion. Everyone thought Japan would take over every industry in the world and that their superiority was inherent in their national character! But what followed was a decade of economic morass for Japan just as predicted in Megatrends Asia. Naisbitt was one of the first to point out Japan's decline publicly. What I found admirable about Naisbitt was that when he believed in something no matter how unpopular the stance, he had the fortitude and the integrity to stick to his guns. And as it turned out, he was right about Japan!Just as he was able to do a decade ago in his other works, it is obvious to me that Mind Set will also stir up controversy with many people today, not the least of whom are those who have a religious belief in global warming. Nobody really knows if the earth is warming up or is in the upswing of a cold-warm cycle. I found it amusing that, in the same year, 2006, former President Bill Clinton, as mentioned in the book, would warn against the impending ice age and his former vice president would win an Oscar for warning us about global warming. Not aware of Clinton's admonition before reading the book, I thank the author for pointing it out to me.Naisbitt's lack of condemnation of George W. Bush's neo-conservative agenda of spreading democracy through war, no doubt, will freak out many more people. The author approached the issue by way of analyzing the European Union's attempt to supplant the United States economic and cultural hegemony around the world. Personally, I thought that the US foreign policy of spreading the ideology of her own brand of democracy militarily was misguided and, in Iraq, disastrous. Despite such differences with the author, I still thanked him for laying out his position on these issues in his book in a sober and enlightening manner.As is ubiquitous of most great works of the imagination, the reader sees a perfectly rendered version of the world filtered through the mind of the artist or the philosopher. This is also true in John Naisbitt's Mind Set. One of the great pleasures of reading this book is that the author, a connoisseur of fine art and architecture, imbues his pages with a love and insight of High Culture. One gets to cadge his discerning eyes in art in addition to his incisive mind. Naisbitt's erudition abounds on almost every page. His eclectic mix of references range from Aristotle to events occurring in 2006, and from Nicolaus Copernicus to Darwin, et al. When he cited a letter from Albert Einstein's youth, he made a childhood idol of mine endearingly human to me. Naisbitt's personal reminiscences about his encounters with the high and mighty as well as with the low and meek gave the book a kind of humanity that one does not normally associate with books written by authors from the business world.I highly recommend this book. For in youth you may find vibrancy; in maturity, wisdom.",

I never had this feeling before of wanting to throw a book literally in the bin. I have read many similar books before but this book is not professional and certainly not scientific.The subtitle \"reset your thinking and see the future\" becomes therefore pretty much a joke, especially when an author starts bashing in this case on Europe without real argumentations or facts. By doing so John Naisbitt exposes himself of being very unknowledgeable or unprepared for this book. It is a worrisome observation as it makes you wonder how John Naisbitt got to his other viewpoints for this book. If you have even minimal international experience you can write better chapters yourself.Another reviewer at amazon.com even wrote that this author talked like a teenager going for a personal revenge against someone or something. Sadly I have to agree with this reviewer. And you simple don't pay for a book to read someone's narrow mind setting, frustrations and very poor made extrapolations. John Naisbitt just tries here to ride on his past-successes.Regarding the \"mindsets\" offered I have to agree fully with the reviewer James A. Hatherley from Boston (reviewer at amazon.com). He wrote an excellent and even very polite (and similar negative) review of this book.So really, forget this book and read \"The world is flat\" by Thomas L. Friedman instead: more insightful, much more objective and way better researched.",

                "review/text": "Peoples' data-processing capabilities are limited. In the information-dense world people are unable to critically review all the information they receive. In order to be adequate to the situation, they resort to so-called heuristics, simple cues or rules for solving the problem. Heuristics are based on peoples' previous experience in similar situations. Although relying on heuristics is sometimes a useful way of dealing with the onslaught of the decision-rich environment, basing our decisions primarily on heuristics can present some problems. First, heuristic cues that we possess may be false. Furthermore, a rule may be appropriate in certain situations but be misapplied in others. Another serious problem is that heuristics can be easily faked and manipulated. Knowledge of heuristics enables propagandists to control peoples' course of action.The authors did a research of propaganda techniques and set four stratagems of persuasion:1. You create favorable climate for the massage (called pre-persuasion). You subtly outline what picture has to be drawn in the end. Here you decide what way thoughts and perceptions of the audience will be shaped and channeled. Having established right basis for further discourse you secure the results you seek. At this stage you should identify some statements as axioms, i.e. `what everyone takes for granted' and `what everyone knows'. You attribute labels (positive or negative) to objects of further discussion, put black-or-white colors in non-disputable way. You use generalities to depict the situation - they are usually so ambiguous that you may change their meanings in the future. You use rumors and gossips.2. You create a `source credibility', i.e. establish a favorable image in the eyes of the audience. The message must come from `experts' or `unbiased' and, of course, personally attractive communicators. Try to switch on the self-persuasion mechanism of the audience.3. You create a message that focuses the target's attention and thoughts on exactly what you want them to think about. Research has identified at least five conditions that are likely lead to heuristics. Heuristics are most likely to be used when people do not have time to think carefully about the issue, when they are so overloaded with information that it becomes impossible to process it fully, or when they believe that the issues at stake are not very important. Heuristics are also used when people have little other knowledge or information on which to base a decision and when a given heuristics comes quickly to mind as they are confronted with a problem.4. You create an emotion of the target that will help you channel thoughts of audience in right direction. Fear appeals are most effective when they raise high levels of fear and suggest a doable and effective responses (the authors also explain why sometimes fear does not work). Guilt: once we are filled with guilt, our thoughts and behavior are directed towards ridding ourselves of this feeling that's where propagandists take advantage of us. Feeling of obligation and indebtedness: large initial request and immediate concession by the requester invokes the norm of reciprocity -we concede. Feeling of commitment based on our desire to be self-consistent. For example, to `soften up' the target you make him involved in a much smaller aspect of the action. This serves to commit the individual to `the case'. Once people are thus committed, the likelihood of their complying with the larger request increases. Another way is to show uniqueness of the offer (scarcity sells). Use the `minimum group paradigm': You are on my side (never mind that I created the terms); now act like it and do what we say. Etc.The book can be used by target audience to learn persuasion techniques and withstand or organize propaganda tricks. The book is entertaining, rich in vivid examples, and ... has everything to be a success in conveying authors' ideas. Instructive. Great read overall.",

                "review/text": "If you want advice on how to be an effective and honest communicator, Anthony Pratkanis and Elliot Aronson have written an entire book about it, Age of Propaganda: the everyday use and abuse of persuasion (265 pages. W.H. Freeman and Company). Pratkanis and Aronson give their own accounts of how propaganda impacted their childhood. Aronson recalls how he felt about the &quot;evil Germans&quot; and &quot;sneaky Japanese&quot; while growing up in the 1940s. Pratkanis lost his navet&eacute; when the Watergate scandal broke. He would later come to the realization that all politicians lie and cheat. The two authors attempt to educate the reader regarding propaganda and persuasion. Their goal is have the reader able to identify devices used, what makes them effective, and how to counteract their effectiveness without becoming a pessimist. All the chapters were enlightening; some stood out more than others and were able to give good &quot;heads up&quot; advice. The authors give the reader the inside track on how advertisers promote their products, a &quot;buyer beware&quot; sort of infomercial. Companies use words such as new, quick, easy, improved, now, suddenly, amazing, and introducing to sell their products. The authors further expose merchants by explaining how they make certain brands more accessible than others by placing them at eye level. Additionally, the consumer is informed that ads using animals, babies, or sex sell the product more successfully than advertisers that use cartoons or historical figures. The buyer is also cautioned on how merchants place products at the end of a supermarket aisle or near the checkout aisle; this strategy catches the consumer's eye and lures them into the &quot;I gotta have it, can't live without it&quot; frame of mind. The authors introduce the reader to a sociologist named David Phillips; the sociologist has made predictions which have been startlingly accurate. For one of his predictions, he had gathered information regarding deaths, which occurred after heavyweight championships. His research uncovered this information: homicide rates rose significantly after 3 to 4 days following a fight. He was also able to conclude that the victims were similar to the fighter beaten in the bout. For example, if a white male was beaten, then murders of young white males increased. The same was true if it was a black opponent. Many people believe the media plays a role in the actions of some people, but no thought is given to how a boxing match could have such an impact on the homicide rate. This study is eerie, yet fascinating. Pratkanis and Aronson inform the reader that instilling fear is often the way we are persuaded to act on an idea. Life insurance agents use fear in order that we purchase policies to &quot;protect our loved ones.&quot; Doctors use fear to insure that we take out medication. Even dentists show graphic pictures of rotting teeth so that we will floss and brush daily. The book was informative and enlightening. It makes one stop and think about how society is constantly being persuaded to think and act the way we do, in a conformist mode. The authors accomplish their goal by enabling the reader to identify devices used and either &quot;go with the flow&quot; or &quot;not be taken for a ride.&quot;",

                "review/text": "\"Age of Propaganda\" spells out in plain terms [contrary to another reviewer's finding of the book as being too \"wordy\"] how mass media is as a leveraging tool used by those in positions of power to coerce \"decision by persuasion.\"To quote the authors, \"the goal of modern propaganda is not to inform and enlighten but rather to move the masses toward a desired position or point of view...these appeals persuade not through the give-and-take of argument and debate but through the manipulation of symbols and of our most basic human emotions...[and that]...the most important determinant is the thoughts running through one's head as a persuasive communication is seen and heard[and]in general, we humans seek to conserve our cognitive energy by taking mental short-cuts whenever we can, and we attempt to rationalize our thoughts and behavior so that they appear reasonable to ourselves and others. Most propaganda appeals attempt to take advantage of these two human tendencies.\"Anthony Pratkanis and Elliot Aronson really put together a humdinger here. I'd like to offer a personal thanks to them as their book had a profound influence on me. In the early 90s I was working as a janitor at a college and found a stack of \"free for all\" books, and, being a reader, rummaged through and came up this dandy heavy hitter. Although, say, much like Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick's in depth documentary on dissident Noam Chomsky and media propaganda, \"Manufacturing Consent,\" also from that era, some of the info has in a short time span become not so much obsolete as it's become more dire and omnipresent in governmental/corporate policy and application.For instance, if I recall, at the time when \"Manufacturing Consent\" was released, there were some forty parent corporate giants controlling mass media worldwide, as where now power has been consolidated, and that number is around five or six. That in itself should deeply concern everyone, yet most people probably aren't aware of it, and would only give you a blank stare if you brought it to their attention. And that's precisely why \"Age of Propaganda\" is such a useful book; it simplistically lays out the historical foundation of propaganda, and how and why it's used against us. The statistics presented to show how many mass media messages are consumed annually by the average person alone is quite disturbing and offers a clear example - hopefully to those who refuse to acknowledge the magnitude of the process - of how the power of persuasion works.As of 1992, the U.S. spent four-hundred million per year on propaganda {imagine what it must be now!}. 1-4 headings are taken from the book, the explanations aren't.1)\"The message must attract the recipient's attention.\"Often this is the classic Problem/Reaction/Solution ruse: government *creates* the dilemma, misdirects and places blame elsewhere, uses the media to exploit the public's fears over the dilemma, and as the public demands resolution, even if they're truly in the dark as to how/why the dilemma came about, then government can implement draconian measures to \"solve\" the problem, when in reality, their \"fix\" is merely Big Brother's way of further stacking the odds in power's favor over democratic interference.2)\"The arguments in the message must be understood and comprehended.\"This one's a no-brainer, just play off of the public's general ignorance and lack of knowledge and awareness. Dumb the message down and exploit the public's fears while simultaneously making the them feel better, stronger, for believing the lies. If you have a whole bunch of idiots all believing the same lies, the collective ignorance and adhered-to unreality is in turn reinforced. ...*pssst,* this is truly a BAD, SCARY thing, k?3)\"The recipient must learn the arguments contained in the message and come to accept them as true.\"People have been culturally trained to watch TV. They generally believe what TV instructs them to believe, even though such psychological gymnastics aren't cast in stone, and most people would voice the opinion that TV lies. So, in order to get around that, the powers that be, through media \"de-regulation\" policies {go look it up yourself!} forged a stronghold within mainline media over the past twenty years in order to help shift public opinion to their Rightist, lunatic position. This explains the \"need\" for 24/7 cable \"news,\" talk radio, and even the allowance of an illusory \"lefty\" democratic party which works to establish the Right's agenda by calling itself \"moderate.\" The repetition of lies and propaganda leads to mass acceptance of lies and propaganda as \"truth.\" Plus, a handful of scoundrel's make big money from the chaos, misery and war profiteeering.Which in turn leads to 4)\"We act on this learned knowledge and beliefs when there is incentive to do so.\"The incentive is obvious: IT MUST BE REAL IF IT'S ON TV! Strength in numbers, that is, United We FALL. So, people give up civil liberties for the illusion of security.Security from whom, exactly? Those who ordered NORAD and the FAA to stand down for ninety minutes during the attacks of 9/11?And that, unfortunately, is the dark heart of the matter.In an illusory democracy, if Big Daddy Boss Goliath wants to further decimate poor little David, then Goliath will need to justify doing so, right? Which, given the grotesque military and economic discrepencies between the two, which should be an obvious elementary truth, is going to require A LOT of persuasion on Goliath's part to convince everybody that David does indeed pose a terminal threat.And if, say, Goliath doesn't just have his deadly sights set on David, but on many other people too, well then, the \"justification\" and deceptive staging of David and Co. as 'Hitler's' and 'Satan's' is going to have to be utmost convincing. Repetition of lies, right? And since the factual reality of the situation could easily be picked apart, then the agenda-setting media need be tucked securely in Goliath's pocket to shut out reality, and a violent, devestating, emotional shock would certainly be helpful in clouding everyone's instincts and moral judgement ...wouldn't it?\"One of the most important determinants of learning is incentive; a persuasive message is learned and accepted if it is rewarding to so.\" ~ from \"Age of Propaganda\"In this age of unprecedented social change and cultural and political upheavals, of mind boggling numbers of unwary, uninformed people who have bought into our government's phony \"war on terror,\" who've ignored the perilous, unconstitutional, 'Orwellian' surveilance system which has permeated our world like a bad rash, now more than ever do people need to educate themselves as to how propaganda works and why those in positions of power use it against us.The primary dilemma people have with discerning and acknowledging propaganda is that Establishment Power has naturally adopted the refutation of it as one of its main talking points. The socio/political fabric of America's environment is so utterly dense with Right wing propaganda that many can't see beyond mainstream media's criterion, although, as an institution that cannot afford to completely ignore the rising tide of dissenting voices, it's collectively been forced to \"allow\" various \"framed\" criticisms. However, these criticisms, framed as such, only serve as further misdirection while making cosmetic attempts at democratic appeasement by setting up the straw man to be torn apart by the Right.Psychologically, the Right's agenda is rooted in imputing to all opponents of its unconstitutional, theocratic state-bound, treasonous, war-profiteering agenda, that which it collectively is most guilty of itself. What's happened here is actually far worse than any mere \"conspiracy;\" we exist in an age where most of us have unprecedented access to oodles of information, yet, according to our actions, or more revealing, our lack-of-proper-reaction-to, this country is laboring under a heavy toll of a spiritual and mental illness that has enabled millions to believe Goliath's monumental B.S. ...and not just to believe it, but for many to actually cheer on the debauchery. Wowzer bowzer.In my copy of \"Age,\" I count twenty-one reference pages, so to answer the reviewer, \"sportsguy,\" who boasted that this book isn't sourced and that its authors used it as a vehicle to smear republicans, the reviewer, if he even read the book, should note that it was written on the tail end of twelve years of shady republican rule, and that just because the book doesn't reflect the reviewer's version of \"reality,\" that in itself doesn't in any way invalidate the numerous sources that the authors *did* reference.",

                "review/text": "here are my notesThe successful persuasion tactic is one that directs and channels thoughts so that the target thinks in a manner agreeable to the communicator's point of view; the successful tactic disrupts any negative thoughts and promotes positive thoughts bout the proposed course of action.Two routes to persuasion - peripheral and centralPeripheral - a message recipient devotes little attention and effort to processing a communication. Persuasion is determined by simple cues, such as the attractiveness of the communicator, whether or not the people around you agree with the position presented, the pleasure or pain associated with agreeing with the position, or whether a reason is given for complying with the request.Central - a message recipient engages in a careful and thoughtful consideration of the true merits of the information presented. The person may actively argue against the message, may want to know the answer to additional questions, or may seek out new information. The persuasiveness of the message is determined by how well it can stand up to this scrutiny.What determines which route to persuasion will be adopted? - the recipient's motivation to think about the message - the personal relevance of the issue. * we are cognitive misers, forever trying to conserve our cognitive energy, we adopt the strategies of the peripheral route for simplifying complex problems.Rationalization trap = first intentionally arouse feelings of dissonance by threatening self esteem, for example, making the person feel guilty about something, by arousing feelings of shame or inadequacy, or by making the person look like a hypocrite or someone who does not honor his or her word. Next, offer a solution, one way of reducing this dissonance, by complying with whatever request the propagandist has in mind. The way to reduce that guilt, eliminate that shame, honor that commitment, and restore your feeling of adequacy is to give to that charity, buy that car, hate that enemy, or vote for that leader.Almost every war in modern times has been accompanied by characterizations of the enemy as less than human. Dehumanization succeeds in resolving any dissonance that may be aroused by our cruelty toward our enemies. However, watch out; the more we justify our cruelty, the easier it becomes. The rationalization trap becomes an escalating spiral: \"I committed an act of cruelty; I justified this act by believing that the victim deserved it. If the victim deserved that cruelty, well maybe they deserve more and maybe I am just the one to give it to them.Four stratagems of influenceThe first is to take control of the situation and establish a favorable climate for your message, a process we call pre-persuasion. Pre-persuasion refers to how the issue is structured and how the decision is framed. If fully successful, pre-persuasion establishes \"what everyone knows\" and \"what everyone takes for granted\" By cleverly establishing how an issue is defined and discussed, however, a communicator can influence cognitive responses and obtain consent without even appearing to be attempting to persuade us. Next, the communicator needs to establish a favorable image in the eyes of the audience. We call this stratagem source credibility. In other words, the communicator needs to appear likable or authoritative or trustworthy or possessed of any other attribute that would facilitate persuasion. The third stratagem is to construct and deliver a message that focuses the targets' attention and thoughts on exactly what the communicator wants them to think about - for example, by distracting the targets' attention on a vivid and powerful image, or even by inducing the target to persuade themselves. Finally, effective influence controls emotions of the target and follows a simple rule: Arouse an emotion that just happens to be the desired course of action. In such situations, the target becomes preoccupied with dealing with the emotion, complying with the request in hopes of escaping a negative emotion or maintaining a positive one.The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world view and mental habits proper to the reader, but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that when Newspeak have been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought - should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words.Language, words, labels, categories organize our realities and serve to divide up the world into neat little packages and to imply the range of appropriate courses of action to take. Words have the power to pre-persuade. It defines our reality, our thoughts, our feelings, our imagination and thus influence our behavior.Agenda setting is of great importance in maintaining power - by determining what issues will be discussed and when, what criteria will be used to resolve disputes, who will sit on what committees, and, which information will be widely disseminated and which will be selectively ignored.Defining the issue as \"losing something\" was more persuasive than stating it in terms of a gainNever ask a question for which you don't know the answer. Never ask a question that doesn't get the answer you want.Card stacking - the order in which questions are asked and the order in which information is received can distort and bias the decision making process.Question asking can be a powerful persuasion device because questions structure our decision making process. They do this by directing our thoughts about the issues at hand and by implicitly specifying the range of possible answers.Context makes a difference, judgment is relative, not absolute. Depending on the context, objects and alternatives can be made to look better or worse. Often we do not pay much attention to the influence of context, must less question the validity of the alternatives presented.One of the important tasks of media research is to keep tabs on the \"reputation and credibility\" of public figures. Advertisers want to know which figures are most believable, who is most liked by the public. The answers to such questions determine the figures value as a spokesperson for the advertiser's product. Credibility has become a commodity not only to be feigned but also to be bought and sold on the open market.Advertisers know that we believe what we believe and buy what we buy in the service of self image. They imbue their products with a \"personality\". To claim the desired persona, all we need to do is to purchase and display the right products.Communicators can make themselves seem trustworthy by apparently acting against their own self interest. If we are led to believe that communicators have nothing to gain and perhaps even something to lose by convincing us, we will trust them and they will be more effective.When the message conflicted with their expectations, listeners perceived the communicator as being more sincere and they were more persuaded by his statementNot only do we tend to take more notice to unexpected events, but we also attribute more credibility to speakers who appear to resist the pressures of their colleagues and who take stands in opposition to their backgrounds.Another way of increasing the perception of credibility: The apparent trustworthiness of a person can be increased and the apparent bias of the message deceased if the audience is absolutely certain the person is not trying to influence them.Specific advice for making yourself likable: say what the audience thinks (which you can find out through polling), make others feel comfortable, and control the atmosphere (the situation) for your best advantage.For increasing credibility - set easy initial goals and then declare victory (this will create the perception that you are a strong leader); use setting to support image; choose the negatives that will be written about you; and understand how people see things, then appeal to what they prefer.Float an idea without attribution (that is, circulate a rumor). If everyone likes the idea, then claim it as your own. If it gets shot down, then deny your campaign ever said it. In this manner, you can always be sure to say exactly what everyone wants to hear. Another piece of advice: make sure you appear consistent in the media. And the best way to do this? Just say a few things over and over again (that way, you don't contradict yourself)Credibility is manufactured, not earned. Credibility is created by carefully managing the situation so that the communicator, looks just the way he or she is supposed to look - likeable, credible, strong, expert, or whatever image is needed at the time.Models are effective for two primary reasons. First they teach new behavior. Second we behave like our model because we believe the rewards received by a model for a given behavior will also come to us. It serves as a cue to indicate that a certain behavior is legitimate and appropriate. It can shape and twist our understanding of what is right and wrong. A model is most effective when he or she is high in prestige, power, and status, is rewarded for performing the behavior to be learned, provides useful information on how to perform the behavior, and is personally attractive and competent in facing life's problems - the model is a credible and attractive source.Confidence of the speaker - the more self assured and confident a communicator appears, the more likely that we well accept what is said - low rates of speech error, an authoritative tone of voice, and a steady body posture, are positively related to persuasion.Load a speech with the \"correct\" symbols and buzzwords as a means of informing the recipient that the message is acceptable and worthwhile.Heuristic - a simple cue or rule for solving a problemFive conditions that are most likely to lead to heuristic rather than rational decision making1 When we do not have time to think carefully about an issue2 When we are overloaded with information that it becomes impossible to process fully3 When we believe that the issues at stake are not very important4 When we have little other knowledge or information on which to base a decision5 When a given heuristic comes quickly to mind as we are confronted with a problemSelf generated persuasion - getting someone to role play an opponent's position, or by asking a person to imagine adopting a course of action - is one of the most effective persuasion tactics ever identified. It gains its power from providing subtle social cues and directions that ask the target of influence, in effect, to think up as many positive cognitive responses about the issue as you can and, if you do happen to come up with some counter arguments, to be ready to refute them. The resulting message will come from a source that you almost always consider credible, trustworthy, respected, and liked - yourself. The act of generating arguments is an act of commitment to the cause. After all, they're your ideas, aren't they?Vivid messages affect our cognitive responses in at least four possible waysAttracts attention - it helps the communication stand out in the message dense environmentIt can make information more concrete and personalIts appeal directs and focuses thought on the issues and arguments that the communicator feels are most importantIt can make the material more memorable. This is especially important if we do not reach an immediate conclusion but base our later judgments on information that comes readily to mind.Frequent repetition of an advertisement helps to meet multiple marketing objectives in a cost efficient manner. Repeatedly exposing consumers to an ad is a good way to introduce a new product or to remind customers of the value of an older brand. Often, repeat exposure is an unintended consequence of attempting to present an ad to multiple target audiences (the members of which may overlap). With the high cost of creating and producing new advertising ideas and slogans, its makes sense to stick with proven winners.The rank and file are usually much more primitive than we imagine. Propaganda must therefore always be essentially simple and repetitious. In the long run only he will achieve basic results in influencing public opinion who is able to reduce problems to the simplest terms and who has the courage to keep forever repeating them in this simplified form despite the objections of intellectuals.Advertisers know that repeated exposure can leas to what is known as \"wear out\" - when an ad loses its effectiveness because consumers find repeated exposures to be tedious and annoying. Wear-out effects are most likely to occur with ads that attract much attention, such as humorous ads and informational messages. Advertisers attempt to eliminate wear-out by using a technique known as \"repetition with variation\". In this technique, the same information or theme is repeated many times, but the presentation format is varied.If you don't have anything to say, sing it. In other words, a mild distraction can disrupt counter arguing and increase the effectiveness of a persuasive message. A lively song can make us happy and thus help use think happy thoughts about a product. At other times the song may get stuck in our head, reminding us of the brand name. At still other times a catchy song or a big production number can attract our attention to the ad so that we don't change the channel or go to the bathroom and we at least hear the advertisers message.The trick for the advertiser is to provide just enough of a distraction to disrupt counter arguing but not so much that it eliminates the reception of the message.Distraction increases the effectiveness of weak arguments (because it disrupted counter arguing) but decreases the impact of strong arguments (because it disrupted the ability to pay close attention to the cogent argument being made).People are less able to develop counter arguments to a time compressed message and that time compressing a message consisting of strong arguments reduced persuasion whereas it increases the persuasive impact of a message containing weak arguments.Most of us have a strong desire to be correct - to have \"the right\" opinions and to perform reasonable actions. When someone disagrees with us, it makes us feel uncomfortable because it suggests our opinions or actions may be wrong or based on misinformation. The greater the disagreement, the greater the discomfort.But this does not necessarily mean the members of an audience will change their opinion.There are at least four ways in which the members of an audience can reduce their discomfort:1 Change their opinion2 Induce the communicator to change his or her opinion3 Seek support for their original opinion by finding other people who share their views, in spite of what the communicator says4 Derogate the communicator - convince themselves the communicator is stupid or immoral - and thereby invalidate that person's position.One sided or two sided argumentIf a communicator mentions the opposition's arguments, it might indicate that he or she is an objective, fair minded person; this could enhance the speaker's trustworthiness and thus increase his or her effectiveness. On the other hand, if a communicator so much as mentions the arguments on the other side of the issue, it might suggest to the audience that the issue is a controversial one; this could confuse members of the audience, make them vacillate, induce them to search for counter arguments, and ultimately reduce the persuasiveness of the communication.It depends to some extend on how well informed the audience is and on the audience's initial opinions on the issue. The more informed the members of the audience are, the less likely they are to be persuaded by an argument that brings out the important opposing arguments and then attempts to refute them. This makes sense: a well informed person is more likely to know some of the counter arguments; when the communicator avoids mentioning these, the knowledgeable members of the audience are likely to conclude that the communicator is either unfair or unable to refute such arguments. On the other hand, an uninformed person is less apt to know of the existence of opposing arguments. If the counter argument is ignored, the less informed members of the audience are persuaded; if the counter argument is presented, they might get confused.Another factor is the partisanship of the audience. If a member of the audience is already predisposed to believe the communicator's argument, a one sided presentation has a greater impact on his or her opinion than a two sided presentation. If, however, a member of the audience is leaning in the opposite direction, then a two sided refutation argument is more persuasive.The more frightened a person is by a communication, the more likely he or she is to take positive preventive action. Fear can be a powerful motivating psychological force, channeling all our thoughts and energies toward removing the threat so that we don't think about much else.People who had a reasonably good opinion of themselves were the ones most likely to be moved by high degrees of fear arousal. People with low opinions of themselves were the least likely to take immediate action when confronted with a communication arousing a great deal of fear - but after a delay, they behaved very much like the subjects with high self esteem. People who have a low opinion of themselves may have difficulty coping with threats to themselves. A high fear communication overwhelms them and makes them feel like crawling into bed and pulling the covers up over their heads. Low or moderate fear is something they can more easily deal with at the moment they experience it. But, given time - that is, if it is not essential they act immediately - they will be more likely to act if the message truly scared the hell out of them.If the recipients of fear appeal perceive that there is no way to cope effectively with the threat, they are not likely to respond to the appeal but will just bury their heads in the stand.In sum, a fear appeal is more effective whenIt scares the hell out of peopleIt offers a specific recommendation for overcoming the fear arousing threatThe recommended action is perceived as effective for reducing the threatThe message recipient believes that he or she can perform the recommended actionThe recipient's attention is first focused on the painful fear. In such a frightened state it is difficult to think about anything other than getting rid of the fear. Next, the propagandist offers a way to get rid of that fear - a simple, doable response that just happens to be what the propagandist wanted you to do all along.Creating granfalloons - proud and meaningless association of human beings.People acted as if those who shared their meaningless label were their good friends and close kin. They indicated that they liked those who shared their label. They allocated more money and reward to those group members who shared their label and did so in a competitive manner.What makes a granfalloon tick - two psychological processes, one cognitive and one motivational. The knowledge that \"I'm in this group\" is used to divide up and make sense of the world. Differences between groups are exaggerated, whereas similarities among members of the granfalloon are emphasized in the secure knowledge that \"this is what our type does.\" One serious consequence is that out group members are dehumanized; they are represented in our mind by a simple, often derogatory label, as opposed to unique individuals. It is a lot easier to abuse an abstraction. Second, social groups are a source of self esteem and pride. To obtain the self esteem the group has to offer, members come to defend the group and adopt its symbols, rituals, and beliefs.Herein lies the secret to the persuasiveness of the granfalloon. If the professional persuader can get us to accept his or her granfalloon, then we have a ready made way to make sense of our lives - the propagandist's way - and as our self esteem becomes increasingly linked to these groups, we have a strong motivation to defend the group and to go to great lengths proudly to adopt its customs. What the propagandist is really saying is: \"You are on my side (never mind that I created the teams); now act like it and do what we say.\"Sometimes granfalloons come ready made. Each group is associated with a certain self image and lifestyle. Products are given a \"personality\" that fits the image of the target market; this advertising then goes on to create further the image of each granfalloon by specifying what needs to be done to maintain a certain image.Shared emotion and feeling can also create a granfalloon. A sense of oneness with others can be produced by sharing a fun time, a sad situation, or a harrowing experience.Co option tactic - subtly to change a person's granfalloon - corporation gives active critic a new position, often highly visible but without real power within the organization. Gradually, the critic becomes increasingly isolated from old \"activist\" friends and increasingly dependent on the corporation for material resources and a sense of identity. The opposition is defused as ties with the old granfalloon are dissolved.Guilt - the feeling that we are responsible for something wrong whether real or imaginary - leads to complianceWhy it worksSympathy, or feeling sorry for the victimRestitution, or feeling the need to compensate for the wrongdoingGeneralized guilt, or the desire to repair a self image tarnished by a transgressionWhen we feel guilty we typically pay little attention to the cogency of an argument, to the merits of a suggested course of action. Instead, our thoughts and actions are directed to removing the feeling of guilt - to somehow making thing right or doing the right thing. We fall into the rationalization trap.Commitment can be self perpetuating, resulting in an escalating commitment to an often failing course of action. Once a small commitment is made, it sets the stage for ever increasing commitments. The original behavior needs to be justified, so attitudes are changed; this change in attitudes influences future decisions and behavior. The result is a seemingly irrational commitment to a poor business plan, a purchase that makes no sense, a war that has no realistic objectives, or an arms race gone out of control.When made to feel like a hypocrite, these people found the one sure way to restore their feelings of integrity: to begin to practice what they were preaching. If we are not made starkly aware of our hypocrisy, we all share the tendency to push the hypocritical behavior out of sight and do nothing about it.When we discover that a commodity is scarce or may be unavailable, one of first inferences is that is must also be desirable. Why else would it be so rare? We tend to use a simple rule, or heuristic: If it is rare, if it is unavailable, then it must be valuable.Scarcity and unavailability can do more than just make an object appear more desirable. When a phantom alternative is present, it can also result in a change in the perception, evaluation, and ultimate choice of the available options.The presence of an attractive phantom made the other options look less attractive - a contrast effect similar in nature to, but opposite in direction from, that found with decoys. Second a phantom changed the relative importance given to the criteria for making a decision. Specifically, the attribute on which the phantom was superior was rated as most important for making the decision.Owning an object that is scarce for or unavailable to everyone else is a means of defining one's self: \"I am unique and special because I won something that no one else (or at least not many) has been able to obtain.\" Just hearing about a phantom may induce worry and concern: \"If they bring out a better product, I'll be stuck with this thing. Maybe I should wait.\"Phantom trap - fixation - focus attention on the scarce or unavailable item By concentrating on the scarce or unavailable, we may forget or overlook the possible. The presence of an attractive but currently unavailable object can focus our attention and resources on obtaining the desired prize. Settling for less than the phantom becomes a conflict that can only be resolved by \"strength of willpower,\" a test that many of us often fail.In many cases, phantom fixation can be a waste of time and energy, especially when the phantom is really a \"red herring\" of sorts - a truly unavailable option.Consumer catch 22 carousel - obtaining a scarce and rare product adds to one's self image as a unique and special person. Manufacturers know this and design and market their products accordingly. If the marketer does a good job of creating a perception of the product as unique, then you desire and acquire it. But the catch is, so does everyone else; suddenly you are no longer an original. Instead of acquiring a product that makes you unique, you have obtained one that makes you just like everyone else. This further heightens the need for uniqueness, and off we go in an endless pursuit of the next faddish phantom. Once we begin using material goods to define ourselves, we are doomed to be on an endless treadmill of dissatisfaction.Selectivity of news - without some form of censorship, propaganda is impossible. In order to conduct propaganda there must be some barrier between the public and the event. Access to the real environment must be limited, before anyone can create a pseudo environment that he thinks wise or desirable. For while people who have direct access can misconceive what they see, no one else can decide how they shall misconceive it, unless he can decide where they shall look, and at what.Everyday news - selection of newsNews reporters typically work beats - they are assigned a group of institutions to cover. This immediately injects one source of bias into news coverage - something that happens off or between beats has a lower chance of being covered unless it is a major disaster or other spectacular event. Off beat stories rarely are covered and aren't considered news.Most reporters are on a deadline; they must prepare a given number of stories by a certain time regardless of what is happening. In order to meet their deadlines, reporters place a premium on sources that can be easily contacted and trusted. This also creates bias in at least two ways. First, the reporter develops a routine for covering a story - ignoring potentially relevant avenues of investigation. Second, the reporter's routine results in the same type of people appearing on the news repeatedly.Increasingly, reporters work for a corporation. This concentration of ownership results pressure on the reporter; certain stories are encouraged or not encouraged depending on their implications for the parent corporation. More subtly, however, corporate ownership biases programming and coverage.As difficult as these pressures may seen, the journalist faces one more pressure that may mean her or his livelihood - the ability of the news story to hold the audience's attention. All television programming, including the evening news, must strive for profits - and that translates into securing ratings and viewers that will attract advertising dollars. And what induces people to watch the news concludes that most viewers want to be amused and diverted; being informed is only a secondary motive for watching. To guarantee high ratings and revenues, mass media content tends to be agreeable and to require little effort on the part of consumers, while still being arousing, emotionally engaging, and above all entertaining.What makes a great news story? Stories thatAre new and timelyInvolve conflict or scandalConcern strange and unusual happeningsHappen to familiar or famous peopleAre capable of being made dramatic and personalAre simple to convey in a short space or timeContain visual elementsFit a theme that is currently prominent in the news or societyThe result of this itch for entertainment is sound bite and photo op news - a montage of brief visual images that play to the crowd. Each event and every idea must be part of a dramatic story amply illustrated with visual displays. Stories that are easily dramatized and visualized are readily covered. More complex issues receive little attention unless they can be made concrete and visual.As one's confidence is weakened, a person becomes less prone to listen to arguments against his or her beliefs. Thus the very people you most want to convince and whose opinion might be the most susceptible to being changed are the ones least likely to continue to expose themselves to a communication designed for that purpose.People tend to acquire information mostly about things that they find of interest and tend to avoid information that does not agree with their beliefs. Should someone find that they have been unavoidably exposed to uninteresting and disagreeable information, a common response is to distort and reinterpret that information, thus ignoring its implications for updating beliefs and attitudes.The use of entertaining programs to disseminate a point of view has been successful in achieving high audience ratings and in changing people's attitudes and behaviors. Not appearing to be explicit attempts at persuasion, they should arouse little resistance, inhibiting the formation of counter arguments by distracting the audience. Most importantly, people will probably watch them without switching channels.Information campaigns can succeed if they follow these simple rules:Make the program entertainingDo not directly attack a viewer's attitude and beliefsEffective propaganda relies on heuristics and appeals to the emotions.Its propaganda's effect for the most part must be aimed at the emotions and to a very limited degree at the so called intellect. We must avoid excessive intellectual demands on our public. The receptivity of the great masses is very limited, their intelligence is small, by their power of forgetting is enormous. In consequence of these facts, all effective propaganda must be limited to a very few points and must harp on these slogans until the last member of the public understands what you want him to understand by your slogan.AND much more. Its very informative. I highly recommend this book.",

In December 1994, after winning a battle with cancer, I stood, nearly bald, in the audience of my first motivational seminar, conducted by Anthony Robbins.Shortly after the seminar I read \"Awaken The Giant Within\" and \"Unlimited Power\" to learn more about taking charge of my destiny. To this day, I refer to these books often for inspiration and guidance.Over the years, I've read and listened to a great deal of self-help material in my quest to discover the secret to success. Without question, this book provides the clearest and most incredibly inspiring ideas. Since reading this book, I've greatly increased my level of health (by becoming vegetarian), doubled my income, and formed my own consulting company.\"Unlimited Power\" consists of three sections:Section I: The Modeling of Human ExcellenceSection II: The Ultimate Success FormulaSection III: Leadership: The Challenge of ExcellenceAlthough the book is quite long, it is a very exciting read. Starting off with \"The Commodity of Kings\" Robbins talks about how specialized knowledge (information) is available to anyone and can literally transform ourselves, and the world. Think of what Bill Gates, through Microsoft, really owns - almost nothing. Instead, he controls a vast reservoir of knowledge.In summary, what I enjoy most about \"Unlimited Power\" and all of Anthony Robbins' other works, is that he challenges you to test his ideas for yourself, instead of accepting ideas on blind faith. Also, I must emphasize that \"Unlimited Power\" (or any other book for that matter) WILL NOT magically make you successful. It requires YOU to work with the material, develop strategies, and most importantly - take action.-----------------Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation",

I knew a lot about self esteem etc, but it's as if I was waiting for ONE FINAL PIECE, the missing part of how to succeed - in a big scale. And this book gave that to me. It's called Personal Power. If you're like me, having read a lot, know a lot as well, then you need that final piece. This book also gave me lots of effective STRATEGIES to control my mind, and it's scientific. From this book, I used the NLP 'swish technique' to get rid of my nail biting habit in just 2 minutes! That was just 2 months ago and I never bit it since( it actually feels unnatural to do it now). Learn how to increse your energy level and see your vitality 'explode'! There are many strategies in this book, many of them from Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) a science that can change your life, habits, fears, attitude, beliefs etc so quickly (in minutes!) that you'll be surprised. How do you motivate yourself to do the things that are good for you (eg study for that exam earlier) and feel happy doing it, and how to de-motivate yourself (eg to eat that pizza). Once you learn the skills in this book, your mind will be at your command literally (instead of letting it run you). How do you create rapport with people and even strangers so easily that they fell like they know you for a lifetime? Another essential formula I learned from this book got rid of my fear of failure that used to stop me from taking action. Since then, my life, my confidence changed so much that I can hardly believe it.",

There is a danger, however, in believing that this book paves a sure-fire path to success.People with poor self-esteem or psychiatric problems (the latter which Robbins thinks are generally the product of running defective mental programs) will find a way to fail within the framework set by Robbins. Competent therapy, the kind that Robbins labels as inefficient, would be much more appropriate for people in this category. Also, I believe that in order to get where you're going, you have to start from where you are, not from where you think you should be. Robbins's approach, although excellent for some, pretty much presupposes we all start at the same place.Additionally, despite Robbins's great success coaching various high-profile people, some of what he says is flat-out wrong, particularly as it relates to diet. In his &quot;Energy: The Fuel of Excellence&quot; chapter, Robbins states that the body converts foods into energy in the following order: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. (This is to support his low-protein diet theory.) A first-year course in biology informs us that the body actually uses proteins before fats. This portion was obviously not proofread by someone with a scientific background... and the this raises the question of how factually sound the rest of Tony's advice is. Also, Robbins's declaration that 30 grams of protein are quite sufficient for an adult is suspect, to say the least. Use personal experience and observation to decide for yourself whether good health can be maintained on such a low protein intake. Even most vegans try to get more than that. Remember, Robbins produces, by his own account, an abnormal amount of human growth hormone, so the &quot;laboratory&quot; of his body will likely not resemble yours. Similarly, the concept of food combining is based upon a limited understanding of how the digestive system works.(An article in the Feb. 2004 issue of Discover Magazine contains an article entitled &quot;What Does Science Say You Should Eat&quot; that provides dietary advice based on the most comprehensive scientific study ever undertaken, overseen by Harvard's Walter Willet. This would be a better source for health information.)Much of Tony's theories, although presented via complex explanations, just seem kind of bogus in actual practice. On the other hand, many others are unique, helpful insights that can easily be verified by common sense. And again, maybe something that brings no results whatsoever for me may be helpful to the right person.If you're particularly drawn to this book, I'd recommend you buy a copy and read it with a critical mind. To anyone else I might suggest you talk with someone who's familiar with Robbins's work and see if it's right for you before buying. I genuinely like Tony Robbins and believe he is sincere. Still, I think a &quot;buyer beware&quot; approach to his teachings is certainly justified.",

This manual, a seminal document, is a key resource on the thoughts and workings of the public relations industry, then only a speck compared to what it is today. Everything from corporate PR to advertising in general has basically internalized what is covered in this book in order to serve those institutional functions that mold the public's mind.This is all related to the 'manufacture of consent', something that Chomsky, who writes a good intro here, and Ed Herman explored in depth in their book 'Manufacturing Consent' where they lay down a Propaganda Model.This is a huge topic for Americans, period. While media and their role, and their 'slants' is a hot topic (sometimes even within the media, but to limited scope of discussion) this book is a straightforward reprint of the PR industry manual. It's no 'secret'--it's more like company policy. It's far more illuminating than the latest pundit book of the week, discussing, among other things, the 'liberal' media, say.Don't let the intro or its author derail you from reading this--this is nothing more than a mini-bible on how to manipulate the masses in an institutional framework (media, PR, government, etc).

                "review/text": "In a piece of amazingly brazen subterfuge, Bernays gives his book a title - \"Propaganda\" - which doesn't tell you what the book is ABOUT so much as what the book IS.That is to say, as Mark Crispin Miller points out in the Introduction, the true nature of this book is to act as propaganda for propaganda. To get the full message on how to carry out propaganda you have to watch what Bernays is actually DOING. If all you take from the book is what Bernays says overtly about how to mount a propaganda campaign you will have missed the whole point of the book.Bernay's central message is, in effect, \"Never openly admit what propaganda is.\" And to this end he carefully confuses and conflates propaganda, PR and straightforward advertising. Indeed, although he uses the term \"propagandist\" a number of times in the book, he usually referred to himself as a \"personal relations counsel\".As an example of how this confusion technique is used in this book, Bernays makes the perfectly reasonable claim that manufacturers need to use advertising to bring their products to the notice of the general public, but manages to blur the distinction between advertising and propaganda so as to make it seem that it is propaganda which is a perfectly natural process in a well-organized society.First of all he sets us up by a series of seemingly reasonable but actually quite ludicrous statements (page 39 - it's a long Introduction):\"In practice, if everyone went around pricing, and chemically testing before purchasing, the dozens of soaps or fabrics or brands of bread which are for sale, economic life would be hopelessly jammed.\"[Yes it would, but don't we actually test many things in a less exhaustive way every time we go shopping? Obviously we do know quick and simple ways to evaluate goods before we purchase without having to go to ridiculous extremes like \"chemical testing\".]\"To avoid such confusion, society consents to have its choice narrowed to ideas and objects brought to its attention through propaganda of all kinds.\"[Oh really? When did this \"consent\" take place? Do we really only consider purchasing goods which we've seen advertised somewhere? And notice the way Bernays slips in \"propaganda\" when he is really talking about \"advertising\".]And finally he presents us with the (utterly false) claim that propaganda is a necessity, AS IF his previous comments logically led to this conmclusion:\"We must find a way to make free competition function with reasonable smoothness. To achieve this society has consented to permit free competition to be organized by leadership and propaganda. ...\"The instruments by which public opinion is organized and focused may be misused. But such organization and focusing are necessary to orderly life.\"Translation: \"For an orderly life the people must be made to think and believe what they are told to think and believe - by people like me.\"Which brings us to the crux of the book, the answer to the question: \"What is propaganda?\"When he finally gets round to giving a simple, straightforward answer to the question (page 161), Bernays writes:\"... propaganda is simply the establishing of reciprocal understanding between an individual and a group.\"Which is pure twaddle, and Bernays knew it was twaddle. And we know he knew it was twaddle because he started his career as a propagandist as a member of the Creel Commission during WW1. The Creel Commission, officially known as the \"Committee on Public Information\" had the task of filling the general population of the US, the majority of whom were pacifists and wanted no part in the European war, with the kind of thoughts and emotions that would move them to support the use of American troops in Europe on the side of Britain and France against Germany.Bernays briefly describes that work in this book (page 54) where he refers to:\"... the manipulators [i.e. Bernays, Walter Lippmann, etc.] of patriotic opinion made use of the mental cliches and the emotional habits of the public to produce mass reactions against the alleged atrocities, the terror, and the tyranny of the enemy.\"Translated into plain English that means:\"We borrowed from the Allies a collection of lurid and bloodcurdling lies* about the Germans, and added a few of our own, such that no decent person reading the material or seeing the pictures (artists' and film makers' impressions, of course) could help but feel that we had no choice but to defeat the barbaric people who were committing such atrocities.\"(*One particularly effective piece of propaganda was the totally fictitious story that German soldiers invading Belgium had started eating Belgian babies - raw!)In other words, propaganda isn't about anything as mundane as promoting envy and greed to sell goods, it is about the deliberate manipulation of people's thoughts and feelings, in a covert (or, less frequently, an overt) manner, to get them to ascent to policies, etc. they might otherwise resist.Bernays' book is of some small interest as an example of an early modern propagandist at work, and gives some examples of the kind of strategies he employed (all the examples in the book, unless otherwise stated, refer to his own work). However, I believe it makes a lot more sense for a 21st century audience if read in conjunction with Noam Chomsky's book \"Media Control\" (ISBN 1-58322-536-6).",

It's a reprint, and somebody re-keyed the text in and did a lousy job of proofreading it (but then, I spent years as a copy editor, so I'm picky--and grumpy about it to boot).The best thing about this book for me was that it led me to Arthur Ponsonby and an out-of-copyright work called Falsehoods in War-Time. (1929) Ponsonby was a member of parliament, did a bit of work for or knew of work being done in WWI for a clandestine war propaganda arm of the military (sounds like our Pentagon, no?) Faked up \"child atrocity\" pictures (this one isn't illustrated, but you can get the picture).Ponsonby tells the story of the Lusitania, too. (I've gotta get that Joe Goebbels quote, about how you can lead any populace to war, so long as you stage a good attack on the civilian population and then keep 'em scared and focused not on the \"false flag\" operations, but on \"The Enemy\"--you know, the ones who \"hate us because we're rich and have freedoms and want to kill us, and they're everywhere.\"None of this stuff is new. And, by golly, it works every time. How many soldiers have we lost now?Here's a great quote from Ponsonby (Page 8): (\"The inmates of colleges are just as credulous as theinmates of the slums.\" That is, you can sucker everyone. Here's some context around that line.\"Other varieties of falsehood more subtle and elusive might be found, but the abovepretty well cover the ground.\"A good deal depends on the quality of the lie. You must have intellectual lies forintellectual people and crude lies for popular consumption, but if your popular lies aretoo blatant and your more intellectual section are shocked and see through them, theymay (and indeed they did) begin to be suspicious as to whether they were not beinghoodwinked too.\" Nevertheless, the inmates of colleges are just as credulous as theinmates of the slums.\"Perhaps nothing did more to impress the public mind --- and this is true in allcountries ---- than the assistance given in propaganda by intellectuals and literarynotables. They were able to clothe the tough tissue of falsehood with phrases ofliterary merit and passages of eloquence better than the statesmen.\"Sometimes by expressions of spurious impartiality, at other times by rhetorical indignation, theycould by their literary skill give this or that lie the stamp of indubitable authenticity,even without the shadow of a proof, or incidentally refer to it as an accepted fact.\"The narrowest patriotism could be made to appear noble, the foulest accusations could berepresented as an indignant outburst of humanitarianism, and the meanest and mostvindictive aims falsely disguised as idealism.\"Everything was legitimate which could make the soldiers go on fighting.\"(here it is, by the way--but it's also in the Gutenberg Project stable)Falsehood in War-Time: Propaganda Lies of the First World WarWhat I recommend, even better than this modest work is:1) Politics and the English Language, by George Orwell (Eric Blair)--it's an essay--you might find it in a collection entitled \"Such, Such were the joys.\"2) 1984, and the appendix entitled \"NewSpeak\", also by Orwell. In 1984, Orwell notes that Big Brother keeps the world in a constant war (like, on an emotion--a \"war on terror\" And Big Brother will \"keep you safe\".By the way--a small digression: You have or will have heard folks in our government, like Shrub and Darth, --and candidates like Rudy Da G.--say that \"the first job of government is to protect your kids and you.\" We all DO know that's pure BS, propaganda, right? The first job of our government officials is to protect and defend our Constitution against all enemies, both foreign and domestic--that is the ONE thing they swear to do before they get to hold office.Now, look what the Preamble to the Constitution sets out--and note the priorities:WE THE PEOPLE of the United States, in Order to:1) form a more perfect Union,2) establish Justice,3) insure domestic Tranquility,4) provide for the common defence [sic],5) promote the general Welfare, and6) secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,do ordain and establish this CONSTITUTION for the United States of America.Note that \"common defense\" item is Number Four. Think about the priorities: If you don't have a \"more perfect union,\" you'll never be able to establish justice for all, and without justice, there surely will be no domestic tranquility--and only when you've got a little to defend do you worry about defending it. and, once defended, you CAN promote the general welfare (you know, things like medical care for all who need it, toys that aren't poisoned with lead paint, towns that miners have dumped mountaintops of lead, mercury and asbestos on so it seeps into the water and poisons all the kids (one child in such a town stayed in the Second Grade...for 26 years. Twenty-six years. D'yuh think lead poisoning had anything to do with that? Of course the mine owners skipped town, declared bankruptcy, let me and you pay for it as a \"super-fund\" site.Then, finally, when we get \"the general welfare\" handled, we might have some time left over for securing a pinch of liberty blessings for me and you and our families, 'n' kids, 'n' grand-kids.see also:Weapons of Mass Deception: The Uses of Propaganda in Bush's War on IraqandEmbedded: Weapons of Mass Deception : How the Media Failed to Cover the War on IraqFalsehood in Wartime: Propaganda Lies of the First World War",

                "review/text": "Once Sigmund Freud discovered unconscious thought, it was all over for the American republic. It was just a matter of time (a few years) before Freud's nephew, Edward Bernays, took the next step and found a way to use Uncle Freud's theories to manipulate the masses into controlling not only consumer behavior, but more importantly, political thought.\"If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, is it not possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing about it\"?\"If you can influence the leaders, either with or without their conscious cooperation, you automatically influence the group which they sway\".In this way, majority rule as dictated in our US Constitution has ceased to be. \"The minority has discovered a powerful help in influnecing majorities. It has been found possible to mold the mind of the masses that they will throw their newly gained strength in the desired direction\".While many of us can admit that we are influenced by external sources in what we spend our money on, nobody, and I mean NOBODY has even an iota of notion that our politics is influenced by those very same external sources.Bernays published \"Propaganda\" in 1928 to \"explain the structure of the mechanism which controls the public mind, and to tell how it is manipulated by the special pleader who seeks to create public acceptance for a particular idea or commodity\".The simple term for this \"mechanism\" is \"mass suggestion\".Sounds innocent enough, until the power-mongers get ahold of it and manipulate the public into supporting needless wars. It was mass suggestion from personality figures (presidents) and authority figures (writers in the mass media) who ultimately transferred the ownership of our thought from ourselves to the government. So just like we are influenced to buy that Izod or Polo shirt or Big Mac, so also are we influenced to support a certain presidential candidate or governmental policy. It all works the same, without us even knowing it.\"...the sincere and gifted politician is able, by the instrument of propaganda, to mold and form the will of the people\".\"Propaganda is utilized to manufacture our leading political personalities\"...\"a good press agent can puff up a nobody into a great man\".\"...propaganda tends to make the President of the United States so important that he becomes not the President but the embodiment of the idea of hero worship, not to say deity worship\".\"The public actions of America's chief executive are, if one chooses to put it that way, stage-managed\". (And this was 75 years BEFORE \"Mission Accomplished\"!)\"...the group mind does not think in the strict sense of the word. In place of thoughts it has impulses, habits, and emotions. In making up its mind, its first impulse is usually to follow the example of a trusted leader\".\"Who are the men\", asked Bernays, \"who, without our realizing it, give us our ideas, tell us whom to admire and whom to despise, what to believe...\"? He answers, \"Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country\".\"As civilization has become more complex, and as the need for invisible government has been increasingly demonstrated, the technical means have been invented and developed by which opinion may be regimented\".\"Propaganda is the executive arm of the invisible government\".\"There are invisible rulers who control the destinies of millions\".And so it was, the public masses in our \"democracy\" became the regimented crowd of Erich Fromm who wrote in 1941 (13 years after \"Propaganda\" appeared) that we have all become automatons, \"mouthing received opinion without ever thinking critically\" leading \"to the attraction of the regimented crowd\".I believe Bernays wrote this book out of pride for what he accomplished in WWI. During WWI Bernays worked for the US Committee on Public Information (CPI) \"A powerful propaganda machine that advertised and sold the war to the American people as one that would \"Make the world safe for democracy\". Even though the US was in that war barely more than one year, 116,000 Ameircan gave their lives in the name of this propaganda. \"The marketing strategies for all future wars would be based on the CPI model\".In the introduction, Mark Crispin Miller writes, \"Throughout the decade there had been a gradual, disorienting revelation of just how systematically, and how ingeniously, the Allied governments had fooled the peoples of two great democracies, Great Britain, and, in particular, the USA. Once the thrill of victory had faded, and the troops came home (if they came home at all) disfigured or disabled, and the reasons for the war were now less clear than they had seemed, the sordid details of the propaganda drive against \"the Hun\" began to circulate...\". (WWI propaganda portrayed the Germans as Huns and that they were eating Belgian babies).And then television was invented. The US government was able to \"suggest\" to everyone at the same time who to vote for and what to believe. For television's influence, see my review of the book,U.S. Television News and Cold War Propaganda, 1947-1960 (Cambridge Studies in the History of Mass Communication).Today, the number one propagandist in the US media is Bill O'Reilly (he isn't paid millions for his show hosting). His viewers have no clue they are the victims of propaganda. It was Fox News who put forth the lie that Saddam Hussein moved his WMD to Syria. Not even the White House is telling this lie, but O'Reilly's viewers bought it hook, line and sinker. While all other networks have conceded that Saddam had no WMD, that Saddam was not linked to either al-qaeda or 9/11, the Fox News viewers are none the wiser, because Fox is all they watch like good little automatons.And Fox News has put lying warmonger, John McCain in your face for two years now. \"a good press agent can puff up a nobody into a great man\".",

Massive subsides to bureaucracies keep tabs on information and people, made easy through technological developments and information storing in computers. Secret and clandestine foreign \"centers of intelligence\" (CIA, NSA) wage war with world economies and non-compliant leaders.By giving the masses daily measured quantities of Propaganda, they are able to manipulate them and even use them towards their advantage (see The McCarthy Era - intense anti-communist suspicion). They use uninformative \"news\" casts (filled with sensational material), tabloid journalism, pornography, reality TV, fast food, identification with team sports, etc to shape impressionable and non-critical minds.It's a pretty easy conquest, as most Americans aren't very able to distinguish that their brains are turning to mush, those who do think are quickly eradicated by the indoctrination system within or made into a non-threat.Good book. Too bad no one will read it, except in Europe.This is a common sense book that details the techniques used by the American political system to control the masses. America has never really been a very intelligent place, so it was always easy for corrupt leaders to swindle their way in.",

                "review/text": "Not only did Bernay believe propaganda had the answer to society's need for order out of chaos, he also strongly believed that propaganda was noble at heart. His major folly was falling victim to his own ideal as to how a propagandist should wholeheartedly believe in whatever he is propagandizing. Bernay zealously pictured a world filled with noble businessmen and women, working together with the public in unison. Perhaps Bernay's business model sufficed in producing profits for business', whilst the public enjoyed the benefits of honest commerce in the early 20th century. Today however, all the 'rules' of Propaganda have been broken with impunity.\"It will be objected, of course, that propaganda will tend to defeat itself as its mechanism becomes obvious to the public. My opinion is that it will not. The only propaganda which will ever tend to weaken itself as the world becomes more sophisticated and intelligent, is propaganda that is untrue or unsocial (122)\"Bernay probably believed his own words when he first wrote the book back in 1928. After seeing the advent of the television, satellite and the early theories of the Internet, Bernay's understandably changed his mind. The book captures Bernay's early theories of propaganda as a tool to better productivity.",

                "review/text": "The overarching theme of this book is simple- Elite men should control common men and they can achieve this control through the use propaganda.This book was written in 1928 by Edward Bernays who was a nephew of Sigmund Freud. Bernays viewed himself as a \"scientist of propaganda\", and that is the perspective from which he wrote the book. He saw himself as a scientist informing his readers about the science of propaganda so that they could use it to become the leaders of society or as he referred to them- societies \"Invisible Governors\". He states that the purpose of his book is \"to explain the structure of the mechanism which controls the public mind, and to tell how it is manipulated by the special pleader who seeks to create public acceptance for a particular idea or commodity. It will attempt at the same time to find the due place in the modern democratic scheme for this new propaganda and to suggest its gradually evolving code of ethics and practice.\"The term Propaganda is never really defined concretely in the book but its definition is implicit throughout- It is any and every technique that can be used to shape and mold man's mind so that he does what you want but thinks it is what he wants. We tend to think of propaganda as a tool used by Governments to achieve acceptance of a course of action they are taking. That is included in Bernays definition but he believes that is uses are endless. It can be used in shaping fashions, ideas, cultural norms; any and ever issue under the sun he believes can and should be shaped by the elite for the masses.Why did Bernays believe that it was necessary for some men to control most men? Simple- Because he believed that most men were incapable of lucid thought on a subject so they needed a \"responsible administrator\" to frame the major issues and make the crucial choices in-order to avoid chaos.Some of the striking items that he mentions are-1. He sees literacy not as making men \"fit to rule\" but just as a platform for men of true understanding to imprint people's minds with various ideas.2. His heavy reliance on psychology, especially group psychology. He believes that if you know the \"mechanism of the group mind\" then you could control them without their knowledge. He believed that the most firmly established principle of mass psychology is that people follow their leader. So the job of the propagandist is to influence leaders. He states that if you can't find a leader for a group then the next step is to use clich&eacute;s or phrases such as \"Bolshevik\", \"Marxist\", etc. to create feelings and shape the public's mood about an issue.3. He does not believe that people buy products and do things solely for utilitarian purposes but for motives which they do not understand, motives hidden in their subconscious, and these motives are shaped by current customs so it is the job of the propagandist to change current customs by first convincing the Trend setters, Movie stars, Politicians etc, to do, say, or buy something and the masses will fall in line.4. He believed that we have apathy in the voting booth because of our form of Representative Government. He says a politician who goes to Washington and votes what his constituents want was uninspiring. What we need are politicians who go to Washington and sway the public through the use of propaganda (creating circumstances, high-spotting of significant events and dramatization of important issues) to gain support for the real issues that the elite think matter and this will inspire the people who will in turn show up to vote with fervor. He even says that this what Dictators and Revolutionaries do and that is why they are so inspiring.5. He believed movies are one of the greatest tools in the propagandists arsenal. That is a point I agree whole heartedly with.So why read this book? Because it is part of the foundation of our modern society. It is a source document that helps us understand how we got where we are. We live in a culture where men use all the techniques explained in this book and have perfected many of them. It shows among other things; the root of modern advertising, the dangers of trusting experts, and enlightens us to the manipulations we face at every turn. In a word- We live in a society and under a Government that operates on the idea that certain individuals are elite men that deserve and need to rule over the masses to prevent chaos.One final thought. One of the greatest enemies to elite men are men guided by Jesus Christ and his Word who cannot be manipulated into believing in the world the propagandists try to create. These men do not need \"Invisible Governors\" because they submit to the true Governor.",

It takes everything readers liked about the original, and provides us with more of it without bringing in anything really new.Of course the writers did bother to invent some new ships, characters, weapons and sofort, but nothing that really adds to the story. It is just more of the same stuff we got from Dark Empire I.In addition to this, one of the major drawbacks to this comic is the fact that a lot of the new things the artists DO come up with are kind of ridiculous. I mean, which Evil Emperor would give his new superweapon a name like \"the Galaxy Gun\"? And how come the Emperor can magically turn any random underling into a powerfull Dark Jedi all of a sudden? If he could do that, why did he bother with Luke in the last book?If you were one of the people who enjoyed Dark Empire I, and you insist on reading more of the exact same thing, then you might want to buy this book. If you didn't like the original, you're certainly not going to like this one either.The only other people who might wish to bother with this comic are the vivid Boba Fett-fans.

Well, they took the repetitiveness to a whole new level with DEII.Now Palpatine's back, even after Luke slashed up all his clones in DEI. And he's got another superweapon, the Galaxy Gun. The idea itself would be a great one, if not for one fact: the weapon stays in orbit over Byss, which is in the Deep Core. Trying to hit a single target with a straight shot across the galaxy is hard enough, but here they're doing it by somehow shooting it through a space so congested by gasses and stars that manned spacecraft find it almost impenitrable. So the idea goes down the tubes.The highly controversial Kennedy art is a mixed course. The coloring can set the mood at times, but I'd still take Nestelle any day. His people are okay, but not very Star Wars-ish. That said, though, he draws good machinery and the ground battle on Byss was superb. Indeed, the large-scale ground battles on Byss and New Alderaan were the high points of DEII.Vietch's story is okay, but when the past is accounted for it gets tiresome. DEI was wrapped up nicely, even after it broke the nicely-wrapped-up ending of RotJ apart. Then Vietch has to throw yet another clone into the mix and downsize the importance of everything again. In a lot of ways, this is like the New Jedi Order series. Can the people in the Republic who fought for years and years ever get a break? Nobody is that bloody selfless.

Exar Kun, a young jedi knight in training has defied his jedi master by reading his holocran which contains forbidden knowledge of the dark power, particularly battle events and their outcome. Kun motivated by his curiousity of the dark side power, is taken advantage of by the spirit of the ancient fallen jedi Freedon Nad, who incidently brought the power of the Sith to Onderon, will quickly begin Kun's descent down the path of the dark side, by showing Kun the secrets of the Sith on Korriban and then on Yavin 4.Amist the main battle yet to come there is a pinch of romance here too.The sound effects and voice dictions are superbly well done. I highly recommend the audio version for a good long drive.The ending is totaly climatic leaving you with a cliff hanger.",

His Jedi Master told him not to go looking into The Sith because he is too young. Maybe he should have listened to the crab Master, I mean he IS A MASTER right? The art is good, except for issue 6. I don't know what happened, but issue 6 can not be part of the series. It is just awful, awful writing and art. The lightsabers are blue sticks. Seriously, they put NO effect into them at all.

        "description": "A total departure from previous writing about television, this book is the first ever to advocate that the medium is not reformable. Its problems are inherent in the technology itself and are so dangerous-to personal health and sanity, to the environment, and to democratic processes-that TV ought to be eliminated forever. Weaving personal experiences through meticulous research, the author ranges widely over aspects of television that have rarely been examined and never before joined together, allowing an entirely new, frightening image to emerge. The idea that all technologies are \"neutral,\" benign instruments that can be used well or badly, is thrown open to profound doubt. Speaking of TV reform is, in the words of the author, \"as absurd as speaking of the reform of a technology such as guns.\"",

                "review/text": "Mander presents four main arguments, and dozens of corollary arguments, against having television as any part of our lives. Any one of them alone might seem plausible but perhaps overblown, but the overall effect of their combined presentation is overwhelming. I closed the book absolutely revulsed by the nature of this technology and how it has manipulated us. I can anecdotally attest to its ill effects in my case, certainly -- I can recognize thousands of brands but only a few plants. My direct knowledge of the world has been reduced by about 20,000 hours' worth of actual experience interacting with real people, time that I spent instead glued to the boob tube, absorbing hundreds of thousands of commercials. I don't have a TV anymore, but whenever I am around one that's turned on, I find myself hypnotically drawn to stare at the screen, irrespective of content. This occurs even if I am in the middle of an interesting conversation -- to my embarrassment and dismay, my eyes dart as of their own accord toward the flickering images. I have to stand facing away from the TV to prevent this. What I consider to be my natural aesthetic sense has been perverted such that I can hardly look at a man or woman -- or myself in a mirror -- without automatically, subtly judging the person's appearance against an internal metric, a deep and narrow palette of beautiful faces and lithe body parts, implanted by hundreds of thousands of advertising images. This phenomenon subtly cheapens and distorts many interactions I have with people.....Just scan the table of contents to Mander's book, ..., and you will begin to see the array of influences these forces have in our culture and in our individual minds.Please buy the book, give it to everyone as gifts this year, ***especially to parents of small children***. I see parents use the TV as a pacifier, but as you will read, it is an incredibly high price to pay just to keep the kids temporarily quiet.....",

                "review/text": "Written in the late 1970's by a former advertising executive, Four Arguments is a coherent diatribe against television. He explores four areas: (1) Television as a poor mediator of experience; (2) television as a way to influence audiences' perceptions en masse; (3) the &quot;dumbing-down&quot; effects of TV on the human being; and (4) the inherent biases of television and how they limit real information flow. The first couple of arguments are more attacks on capitalism and the development of television as a capitalist tool, but overall, they are solid statements that stand on their own.However, TV has become a central part of the American lifestyle, and it would be hard, if not impossible, to get rid of. But I definitely feel the truth of his arguments. When I was in India, much of the time at my host family's place, they would sit around watching television while doing chores. It felt empty somehow. Where was the richness of the culture? Here I am in India, and I'm sitting here watching a stupid Hindi movie instad of interacting in a meaningful way. And when I came back home, I felt the shock of the media doubly. Everything on TV looked slick, fake, contrived, absolutely ridiculous. We have been so inoculated to all of this by now that it's hard to see unless you go away and come back again.It's tough to break any sort of addiction, and I think television is an addiction. It is part of the problem of a society that always looks for the next best thing, that promotes the loudest, noisiest, most violent thing, that can't sit still for half an hour to soak in the beauty of quiet stillness.In some ways, this book is hard to read. It's easy to grasp but it's difficult to take this kind of attack on such a commonly accepted lifestyle even though you know it's wrong. Plus it's a lot of information coming at you at once; I had to digest it in little bits and pieces to give it time to sink in.",

The critical thinking skills of human beings2. Our relationship to natural environments.3. The physical and mental health of human beings.4. The knowledge/power balance in a democratic society.(not in that order)CONS1. Not a simple read. This book is probably organized too well. Mander coherently and methodically plumbs through each argument and sub argument with no regard for the lazy or quick fix reader. His adherence to his own structure is relentless. The payoff is cumulative as the book gathers momentum. Clear but tedious.2. This book is pretty depressing. For me the resulting sobriety was worth the cold shower, but perhaps not for everyone. Only the most determined of readers will be able to reject all of ideas presented in this book, and unfortunately this book offers a bleak but well painted picture of our predicament. Blue pill enthusiasts beware.PROS1. This book asks important and obvious questions(You'll say \"yeah that is a good question!, why didn't I think of that?) about how man made technologies and environments are affecting us. They are questions that most of us would agree need to be answered, yet amazingly, few if any of which have been adequately answered to this day. (The book was written in the 70's)2. This book is both spell binding and spell breaking. Mander reaches into the silent, unsure parts of our minds that we have become experts at ignoring. After making it about a third of the way into the read, I experienced a tremendous feeling of relief at being able to fully identify and articulate concerns that had previously eluded the full grasp of my conscious mind. For better or worse, my fears now had a voice that I could engage in the light of reason.3. Mander presents a well supported and balanced argument. He is very clear about the fact that he is merely raising questions and considering issues. He admits his shortcomings in not being a scientist, and repeatedly apologizes for not being able to make hard scientific conclusions. He is consistent about differentiating fact from opinion Although the book at times feels somewhat conspiracy theory- ish, this is probably more due to the nature of the topic, than to lack of rigor or objectivity on the part of the author.Perhaps one of the most convincing reasons to check this book out is the reactions of its critics. They consisently use words like \"insane, ridiculous, and nonsense\" ...in violent wholesale rejections of the ideas in this book. Its always fascinating to me when people idignantly deny their dependence/addiction to a particular habit/technology while simultaneously baring their teeth at anything or anyone suggesting that they curb their use of it.\"4 Arguments\" is both disturbing, and compelling. In all fairness, I should probably mention that since I read it three years ago, I've fallen into the habit of calling it my favorite book.",

But this book is a mess --- lots of mostly anecdotal evidence damning TV (that capitalist tool), but in the main, the author, Jerry Mander (if that's really his name), seems wrapped a little too tight.To accept the book's major premise, you gotta believe in dark conspiracies to control, control, control in order to profit, profit, profit. Mr. Mander says TV's mission is to condition us as workers/consumers, to create happy robotic shoppers whose sole function is to keep the capitalist wheel turning smoothly. It's all very Orwellian (indeed, the book invokes both &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;). ... But people have always been worker/consumers. (Doesn't the Bible say that when we lost our lease on the Garden of Eden, we were condemned to get our living by the sweat of our brows?)You don't need a conspiracy theory to explain the workings of television. The &quot;mission&quot; is to sell advertising; to do that, TV must create an audience. To do that, it must appeal to something in us humans that impels us to watch. You may not want to meditate on THAT particular heart of darkness, but it doesn't require a cabal of Big Capitalists plotting to own our minds. Now, the Soviets may have used TV that way. But who really wanted to watch?Mr. Mander argues that consumerism (as seen on TV!) is all smoke and mirrors; creating the illusion of choice between competing products obscures the fact that none of the products is actually necessary. He wonders, for example, if we really need soap and suggests we've been conditioned by advertising to prefer &quot;artificial&quot; scents to good old-fashioned body odor. (BO -- it's all natural.) But I think the simple truth is soap smells better. Hey, we're human! Artifice R Us.One interesting factoid that does not appear in the book but should: The crime rate in South Africa, which had been stable for 50 years, began climbing sharply within one year of the introduction of television there in the early '60s. Coincidence? I don't think so....I'm not saying you shouldn't read the book. There's some good stuff in there. Besides, it beats watching television.",

Of course we were very busy with work, gardening, hiking, and mountain climbing (and reading!). We both read, and we didn't miss TV at all. When &quot;Four Arguments&quot; came out in 1978, we bought it. What it says is true.You become impatient because TV teaches you to expect instant gratification. So you have difficulty in your life with things (like relationships or school) that require stamina and self-discipline.You find that you have no interest in reading a book or newspaper (you're impatient, see above). Do you find it odd or unusual that you (or your children) don't like to read and have no interest in books?When you go to the dentist or doctor, do you find yourself fidgeting because you have to wait 30 or so minutes before you see him? You don't have anything (any TV, that is) to occupy you while you wait. Of course the other people sitting around you are perfectly happy reading books.You become shallow and stupid because you get all your information from TV soaps and TV news. Of course TV news isn't information, just headlines with no backup. No explanation of whether it is true or not, or why it was fed to you. A year later you find the TV lied to you (&quot;WMD,&quot; or &quot;9/11,&quot; or &quot;the Patriot Act&quot; sound familiar?), but you don't do anything about it because now TV is distracting you with a whole new series of lies.If you want to see very clearly exactly how people think you are stupid and that you will believe anything they tell you, read &quot;Lies, and the Lying Liars That Tell Them,&quot; by Al Franken.Instead of watching TV, you should be reading the NY Times and your local paper. Buy books from Amazon.com (or borrow them from your library) about things in which you are interested.If you (or your children) want a full and happy life, put your foot through the TV and set it out on the curb with the other junk.",

                "review/text": "Tune in again and again... This book has all the classic elements of a conspiracy theory: mass hypnosis, broad alteration of neurochemicals, a reordering of perception, social structure and thought to the benefit of a select few, an addictive nature, the list goes on. The scary part is, we all know that what Jerry Mander points out is true. He pushes our awareness of the evils of television to new heights, but he doesn't weave a fantastic yarn...he puts concrete evidence behind things people have been thinking for a long time. TV is addictive. TV watching is indistinguishable from hypnosis, affects sensory deprivation, is disorrienting and leads to hyperactivity and insanity.TV encourages mass passivity, burns images permanently into our brain that are chosen by an elite few and trains people to accept authority. Television limits and confines human knowledge. It accelerates our alienation from nature and leads to its destruction. Television homogenizes those who watch it, making the population more efficient cogs in the economic system, making the population easier to control. Television is inherently antidemocratic--furthermore it aids the creation of societal conditions which produce autocracy, and it dulls our awareness that this is happening. Television, as a technology, is inherently biased towards these effects--they cannot be eliminated by better management or better programing. Oh, and it causes cancer too.This would all sound like a crazy conspiracy theory yarn to me, too, if I hadn't read the book. Mander makes logical and cogent arguments, but most of all, he points out things that we can all see for ourselves. Don't belive that TV burns images into your mind that you can't ever get rid of? That an elite few select what is to be emblazoned into the memory of entire populations? Try this: The Energizer Bunny. Can you picture it in your head? OK, now erase it. As with everyone else, you can't--it has been placed involuntarily, and permanently into your being. Try another experiment...think of one of your favorite sports stars or entertainer (i.e. Merle Haggard) that you have seen in person. Visualize an image in your head... Was that image one that you saw in 'real life' or one that you saw on TV? Having a difficult time recalling reality from TV reality? Most people do--and that's the scary part. The elite few who control TV content involuntarily place permanent images in your head that you are unable (without careful attention) to distinguish from reality. Suppose, hypothetically, that there was someone out there who would stand to gain from altering your image of the 'perfect family' to one that owns a nice suburban home, drives two cars, goes to church, works hard until retirement in a 'good' job, supports the government in times of crisis, etc. Fortunately for us, that kind of thing only happens in George Orwell books...We all already know that TV, or at least too much TV is bad, but what are we really supposed to do about it? Is this guy actually suggesting that we eliminate TV entirely? Yes, he is, and his message goes far deeper than just Television. In an economy and society committed to newer, faster, more and never-ending growth, Jerry Mander makes the argument that we must at some point develop the ability to achieve balance, to pick and choose which technologies we want, or can afford, to use. The elimination of television would be difficult...we may even have to occaisionally talk to people, but to pass on an \"advance\" is a step that we must realize is more than necessary--it is possible.",

Television, in its perverse way, has kept most of us from that knowledge, because of its inherent flaws.It is inherently boring, but in the gross cooption and misadaption of artistry and faith among the best of us, television has reduced us to our lowest common denominator: boring people without self understanding.We are ALL suspect; I am just as guilty of being a stupid TV couch potato as anyone. In all my years of watching it, I cannot say that I have learned any real lesson in life from it.Like Mander says, television robs the brain of its ability to think. When one sees a movie after reading a novel - Lord of the Rings is yet another example - our imagination is replaced by the \"reality\", and we forget what we have imagined before.If critics of this book believe otherwise, I hope they can tell us how the substitution is better than our individual imaginations.I only hope that Mander is fast at work on his second set of arguments!",

Okay, I'd like some of the backround writing to have been translated- but the more important parts, like 'grin' and 'copycat' were written nicely if one looked closely. And, you can't exactly get rid of the large letters in the backround- they portrayed a lot of emotion when Hideki would shout in anguish at Chi's actions. Or exposure to girls, in general, in either real life or in.. certain dreams. Naughty, naughty!The storyline was interesting- it covered a lot about Shimbo and Ms. Shimizu's , leaving very little confusion about it but allowing for a few laughs as Hideki oversees things. It also shows Hideki having divided feelings, as he confides to Yumi that Chi's just a machine but then he goes back home and forgets there's a difference.All in all, the storyline was rather deep for a comic which could be enjoyed by kids.. I'd say, twelve and up. Unless they were male, or somehow turned on by drawings of naked women. Hideki had a constant obsession with pornography, and Chi had no ideas about modesty, with a tendancy to play copycat to things she saw other people do. While there's less of Chi posing ... the girls in Hideki's porn, Chi DOES go to work in a peep show- however, she doesn't actually show too much; just keep it away from little children. Chi is constantly nonsexual and really very sweet- there is no fear that this is a form of hentai, as Chobits might show a bit of skin but overall it remains both innocent and charming.",

The entire first volume gives you information that doesn`t seem very important at the time so the whole thing seems really uneventful.However, I happened to buy the second one and read it out of boredom and found that the story really starts to get better at this point and the plot speeds up a lot. The first volume seems bland and empty in comparison to how intriguing the later volumes become. Eventually the storytelling gets a little deep, and very interesting questions are brought up about persocoms, the very human-like robot computers the story revolves around. Would it be right to create a machine that could make its own decisions? What makes people and machines different? If it`s okay to not consider the robots people because they don`t have real feelings, then what makes feelings real? And a question that Hideki wonders himself is, Why are the persocoms made to seem so human-like anyway? Which makes the reader wonder, If we had the technology to make things like persocoms, would we? It actually ends up being a very smart and deep story.As well as making me think about a lot of things, this series is very entertaining because of its art. Clamp always delivers very impressively as far as art goes, and this series is no exception. I`m always amazed by Clamp`s creativity in character design and the clothes that the characters wear. (Then there`s when the characters are wearing nothing, which happens a lot in this series, as you should be warned. But even at those parts the art exceeds that of other manga.)I would probably recommend this series to females, but I think some males could possibly enjoy it, too. If nudity would make you very uncomfortable you shouldn`t read this, even though most of the nudity happens in scenes that aren`t even necessarily sexual. Like all of Clamp`s manga that I`ve read this one is very addictive. After reading the first one you may not like it as much but after this one it gets a lot more interesting.",

When that heresy is found to infiltrate the hierarchy of the Imperium and the Inquisition itself, he must rely on himself alone to deal with it - even if it means making deals with the enemy.

                "review/text": "Eisenhorn, as the collected works are now known is the quite possibly best of Dan Abnett's work. Originally published as three separate paper-back novels named Xenos, Malleus, and Hereticus this new edition includes the unabridged contents of those three books as well as two \"arching\" short stories of about twenty pages that connect books one to two and two to three. This is an amazingly opportunity.Covering a period of nearly three hundred years, Eisenhorn is an epic tale of the far distant future of humanity. The galaxy has been colonized by mankind and is united together in one glorious and dark Imperium that spans nearly forty-percent of the galaxy, untold trillions of human beings spread across thousands and thousands of worlds struggle for survival as the Imperium's tenuous hold on its territory and its way of life is threatened from without and within by forces both malevolent and ancient. Principle among these foes are the insidious taint of warp-spawned daemons and their corrosive chaos that corrupts the very soul of and body humanity, aliens who range from disdainfully arrogant to primordially evil, and the threat of insurrection from within the ranks of humanity itself.Set in the Helican Sub-sector, Scarus Sector, Segmentum Obscurus, but a small part of the massive Imperium, Eisenhorn will sweep you away across a region of the galaxy which spans nearly two dozen worlds. Named for the central protagonist of the novels, Gregor Eisenhorn, this tale follows his life of as Imperial Inquisitor, a man who has the power to devastate worlds and commandeer virtually any of the forces of humanity in his pursuit of the purification of the human race and the eradication of the mutant, the alien and the heretic. It is a tale with more in common with the epic poems of the Norse and Greeks than with modern science fiction for not only does it cover matters military but it has more than its share of, intrigue, desperation, a vast cast of characters, poignant moments of drama, betrayal, hopeless odds, sacrifice and mad hope.Abnett's setting and visuals almost leap out of the page and his characterization and storytelling is not only the best in the Black Library but one of the best in genre. Part Tom Clancy and part Robert Jordon, Abnett's tale of Gregor Eisenhorn from age 30 to nearly three hundred is a magnificent experience both sinister and sublime. You will not be disappointed.",

                "review/text": "Much as we love its products, Games Workshop and its related entities (Forge World, Fanatic Press, et al) are not best known for 'value pricing.' One such, however, the Black Library, has done its readers a tremendous service--anddone it for a terrific price, as well.Dan Abnett is almost universally lauded as the best of GW's stable of writers exploring the grim, dark future of its Warhammer 40,000 universe. While his 'Gaunt's Ghosts' series is probably his most popular, and its gritty,in-the-trenches, on-the-front-lines view of the 40Kverse appeals to readers of both SF and military fiction, his three volume series about Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn and the goings-on within the vast Imperium of Man behind those front lines is arguably his best...so much so that the three paperbacks which made up the series--'Xenos,' 'Malleus' and 'Hereticus' (named for three major branches, orOrdos, of the investigatorial Imperial Inquisition which Eisenhorn serves)--quickly sold out and became secondary market collectibles.Readers have clamoured for an omnibus edition of the three under one cover--and the Black Library has now delivered that, with 'Eisenhorn.' They've added to the collection, however, by including an introduction from Abnett outlining the origins of the project, as well as two interstitial short stories otherwise available only in old issues of the much-missed GW fiction magazine 'Inferno!' They've topped it with a terrific cover painting of Eisenhorn by ClintLangley (after Adrian Smith's original); and then they've priced the whole package for little more than a third of what the original novels alone cost, new.This is a tremendous series: if you are a fan of action/adventure, space opera, borderline superheroics, or military fiction (particularly of the 'small band of specialists on a mission' subgenre), you are going to find as much toenjoy as the dark science fiction reader the book is ostensibly aimed at...and if you've an interest in any corner of GW's richly-detailed 40K universe, you will not get a better 'feel' for it than you will here. Abnett draws hischaracters richly and emotionally, conjures a plot around them over the course of the three novels filled with wonderful small moments and an occasionaljaw-dropping sequence (the beginning of 'Hereticus' is so good, you will wonder how its climax can ever begin to equal it), but--probably best of all--never loses sight of the series' real star: the unique universe of GW's 41st millennium,which he never fails to find an opportunity to detail and explore, always convincingly.The three books of the 'Eisenhorn' trilogy are my favorite 40K novels thus far. Having them under one cover is a real 'fanboy' delight, a pleasure increased by the bonuses the Black Library has thoughtfully included. And the pricepoint means I will be able to introduce the Warhammer 40K universe to more than a few friends who do not play the games, but whom I know will enjoy these stories.Well-done, GW. Of course, a limited edition of the collection in hardcover would still be even nicer....Christopher Allen+++",

Abnett brings out the best in the Warhammer 40K canonical background, capturing the dark essence of the Inquisition in this case, as he similarly captured the core of the Imperial Guard in the Gaunt's Ghosts series.In short, this is one of the \"essential library\" for any 40K fan, and makes for a good read even if you don't fit into that category.",

                "review/text": "`Middle Ages in space' doesn't do justice to Warhammer 40000, which draws on elements across the tapestry of western history to create a dystopian but many-layered future universe. Where Warhammer was confined by its late medieval setting, 40K gets to indulge a smorgasbord of historical flavours - Imperial Rome, Victorian England, 20th century fascism - while keeping Elves, Orcs and other medieval fantasy staples, only adding spaceships and guns. Hardcore science-fiction buffs may sniff as such quarrying of the past as intellectually lazy and tacky, but that's their loss.It's this sort of descriptive opulence that makes the Eisenhorn novels worth the read. In contrast to his Gaunt's Ghosts series, which can qualify at a pinch as military fiction, Abnett's trilogy of the plucky Inquisitor can't aspire to the detective genre. He gives us a sequence of events rather than well-defined plot lines leading to a resolution, admittedly a criticism that could be applied to many Sherlock Holmes stories. The trick is that the reader doesn't notice because he (more occasionally, she) is absorbed with the events themselves and the backdrop against which they take place. As Abnett acknowledges in the preface to the one volume edition, the idea was to give readers an insight into the texture of the 40K universe, so often sublimated into the pervasive violence associated with Games Workshop. The `storyline' is Eisenhorn's self-narrated personal journey, which is used to showcase the 40K universe and serve as a metaphor for its moral paradoxes, with liberal doses of bloodshed, psychokinesis and daemonancy thrown in along the way.An Inquisitor was the obvious choice for this role, not just because he gets to travel but because the Inquisition is the Imperial institution par excellence, its raison d'etre being to root out difference within Imperial society and burn it - sometimes literally - in the name of species survival. The first paradox is obvious: to save humanity one has to crush it, in spirit and often in flesh. The second and connected one is more subtle: to fight the darkness one must flirt with it, a dilemma Abnett achieves primarily through the daemon Cherubael, who despite being more a device than a character and warp spawn to boot is one of the Black Library's more memorable creations. The implications of this ethical impasse aren't pretty. Everything Eisenhorn is attached to as a human being (even his own body) is progressively destroyed, leaving him stalking the shadows alone, or more precisely with an imprisoned daemon for company. The God-Emperor's work is a hard calling.As expected of a 40K novel, Eisenhorn is not exactly a light read. Occasional scenes of poetic charm and even beauty relieve a sea of grimness, in which most characters eventually die with varying degrees of unpleasantness. It seems to be the First Law of Science Fiction - the more dystopian the universe, the more readers relate to people living in it - and Abnett, who's perhaps better known for his work on the 2000AD (Judge Dredd) franchise, is an old hand at this. I can't think of a novel that better captures the baroque and sometimes frankly disturbing appeal of Warhammer 40000.",

                "review/text": "I was always intrigued by this Universe ever since the early 1990s when a friend of mine from university introduced me to the gaming Warhammer Space Marine miniature figurines (which I was always fascinated with) but which I never collected, painted, played or saw anybody play. I'll ask true Warhammer fans and connoisseurs to forgive me as I review this book and share a little bit about the Universe of Warhammer from an outsider's perspective. If you don't know science fiction, I'll ask you to stop here as what I'm about to write will be unintelligible to the non sci fi fan.This omnibus is actually 3 entire books which tell the story of the Imperial Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn. What is an Inquisitor? Well let me tell you about the Universe to help provide context. Warhammer 40,000 Universe is set circa the year 40,000 in a time when humanity has colonized countless millions of planets throughout a good portion of the Milky Way. The whole Imperium is ruled by an Emperor centered on Earth who exists in a half dead state (he's ruled for thousands of years in this state....The Horus Heresy books tell the story of how the Imperium came to be) and the whole administration of the Empire is somewhat Feudal and Medieval with gargantuan bureaucracies and religion seems to permeate a significant portion of people's lives. So many technologies have been invented and forgotten that technology has come to be regarded as technomagic and there's a whole religion associated with technology. There's an Imperial Army and there are Space Marines, the Emperor's elite, genetically engineered, and powerarmour augmented fighters. In this time, faster than light space travel is through something called the Warp also known as the Immaterium (hyperspace) but hyperspace is not empty like in Starwars or Star Trek, hyperspace is teeming with demons and lost souls that are just ready to rip a spaceship that is not protected appropriately -- This realm of the Immaterium is also known as Chaos. In certain places the Imaterium is very close to real space (the two realities, ours and chaos, are very close to each other and here demons will sometimes spill out into the real universe and invade and corrupt real worlds and people (they become tainted with chaos)). In addition to the threats of chaos, there are orks and elves (homage's and elements of traditional fantasy, Tolkein etc)and insect like creatures (homage's to Starship Troopers and the Forever War) and ancient powerful creatures from millions of years ago --- and everything is fighting everything in this Universe (homage's to Brin's Earthclan etc). So there is plenty of evil to go around.With me so far? Here then the Inquisitor's job is to seek out and find the taint of Chaos, mutants, orks, xenomorphs, elves etc throughout the Imperium (basically orks and evil elves, genestealer cults, and demons). Inquisitors are very independent but they each carry the full weight of the Emperor, each has his own way of doing things but they have a hierarchy and they go out throughout the Universe seeking anything evil and once they do (each in their unique way) then they focus the Empire's legions to destroy it. They're like the white blood cells of the imperium by finding evil, tagging it, and then having space marines or imperial legions to come and destroy the evil.What we wind up with is a very Gothic, dark, dystopian and dystopian in the sense that this Universe entirely unapologetic in the torment and suffering of its people (hopelessness, war, terror, is the norm). Seems dark huh? It is....Begin tiny spoiler ****The Omnibus of Eisenhorn finds Eisenhorn already a full fledged Inquisitor hunting evil and traces his development as his devotion to emperor has him use more and more marginal (almost heretical) approaches to hunt Chaos and finally leaves us with an Eisenhorn who is devoted to the Emperor but who will use even Chaos to fight Chaos....is Eisenhorn good or evil - hard to tell....and this also leaves the gamers with the character as the gamers and their miniature games portray him....a Super Inquisitor***************End SpoilerI loved this book -- if you're going to jump or dabble (as I) in the Warhammer Universe --- this book is probably the best to open the doors and show you the Warhammer Universe. If you want some background on how the Warhammer Universe came to be, I highly recommend Horus Rising also a tremendous book from Abnett. Eisenhorn will show you some of the greatest parts of the Imperium as well as some of the worst evils and you'll even be rewarded by Abnett by him giving you glimpses into almost every facet of the Imperium including some glimpses into some Space Marines, Chaos Space Marines, and Titans and Chaos Titans (giant sentient Battletech like robots -- Warhammer fans, don't shoot me for comparing Titans to Robotech).Adult Context and note to PARENTS (next two paragraphs)A couple of things I didn't like about this book in fairness. Inquisition brings back thoughts of the Spanish Inquisition and some of the other horrible atrocities like the Holocaust that we as humanity have done to our fellow man and especially some of the atrocities towards the Jewish People. Also, this Universe is very very dark and grim - aside from being gothic it is filled with endless suffering and there is no hope for this suffering to ever end so it seems so unending but that is part of the appeal to the Universe. Also, I imagine by writing about Inquisitions and these terrible dystopias, in some grim sense - it helps us remember some of the horrible things we've done and how important it is to try to keep our real universe from becoming a Warhammer type Universe (I imagine WWII felt very much like Warhammer).Off the soapbox and back to the book, Eisenhorn and his company of travelers (and it felt formulaic in a the sense of having an almost D&D; or Final Fantasy where Eisenhorn builds a company of companions and then goes on quests and solving the world -- regardless, they all became very real to me and I connected with them. I've read some of the other Space Marine books since then etc and I must say writing for this genre is very very hard especially for Space Marines (they're very one dimensional) so once you finish Eisenhorn and you decide to venture beyond, you will find much more one-dimensional characters and writing appropriate more to young adult audiences (although don't know if I want my young adult reading this without the context of the holocaust, WWII, Khmer atrocities, Rhwanda etc so if you're a parent and your 12 year old is reading this genre - definitely consider pulling them aside, sitting them down, and provide some context...would I let them read? don't know - your call.Abnett did a great job with Eisenhorn (probably the best Warhammer Novel I've read -- although i'm working through Horus Rising and that's also truly fantastic). Disclaimer, I'm not a gamer or a Super Diehard Warhammer person and I'm definitely not Goth in any way. I'm glad I read it and I'm glad I got to peek into this fantastic and rich Universe that brings so much enjoyment to so many and which to me is comparable to the Dune, Starwars, Startrek in matter of complexity and Scale. So connoisseurs please don't bash me for highlighting this as a dark dystopian universe or analogies to holocausts etc.....the darkness is the appeal and so long as we approach it from a mature standpoint, this has tremendous entertainment value as proven by an almost 20+ year longevity and worldwide following. Fantastic!On Abnett -- Fantastic writer. You can tell he is very literary, very well versed, and has complete mastery of storytelling. I've loved every book I've read from him. His characters are real and I definitely connect with them.On Amazon - Discovered and bought this from Amazon. When I was done, I went to a local bookstore to look for something else Warhammer and found a very limited selection (Its gotten better lately as this genre has gotten more popular though) but overall, for some of these harder to find books or the latest Warhammer releases - I find Amazon the best.",

I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of the characters, the complexity of the story, and the multiple plots Dan Abnett devolves throughout the 800+ pages.Eisenhorn is a compilation of three books. The continuity of the story and consistency of the characters warrants putting all three under one cover. I found each book; Xenos, Malleus, and Hereticus quite entertaining. The entire Warhammer 40,000 universe is based on the monolithic struggle of man vs. machine vs. evil vs. everything else. The Eisenhorn character is an agent of the empire of man whose primary mission is to stand between the onslaught of evil and evil machines and the countless billions of humans who exist in a quazi-techno hell set in the far future (*breath). His purpose is to stamp out `Heretics' desire to obtain forbidden technology and the countless incursions of beings from an alternate universe called The Warp. He is accompanied by several characters throughout the book that are developed in concert with Eisenhorn.If you like to read about a never ending war with death and destruction on this kind of scale then I would think you would enjoy this book as much as I did. I could barely put it down as I was pulled right into the development of Eisenhorn right from page one.I reccomend this book to anyone who is a fan of Sci-Fi",

In addition, Abnett expertly grabs threads fromdisparate genres; Space Opera, High Fantasy, Lovecraftian Horror, Cyberpunk,Steampunk, Spy Thriller, Historical Renaissance and Religious Devotional, andexpertly weaves them together into a rich and beautiful tapestry which few worksof science fiction can rival, and which is at once both completely unique andcompletely in harmony with the 40K universe which I've always imagined.Kudos Dan!!

HERESY!I have returned again and again to this author, but sadly nothing has quite matched the scope and force of his tour de force, the Eisenhorn saga.An epic you will remember. The characters and their fates and relationships will stay with you like few do. Years later I still remember key events vividly, and this marks the THIRD time I have frickin bought these particular stories, after twice having erroneously decided that saving weight and discarding non-essential personal belongings prior to making military moves around the world were more important than a good read.That said, there are some gripes.- Lack of occasional polish. Some endings feel rushed.- Some fight scenes are a bit silly, at least to the ex-mercenary, deepsea diver military man that I am.- He tried a little too hard to be hip, steampunk-ish and street-creddy in the scene where two of the main protagonists hit the slums.- Though he generally does a good job of keeping the fantastically impossible to a minimum, there are exceptions, where you just kind of groan and wish he'd just pay attention to the laws of physics and facts of old age a bit more. Heroes can be heroes, and a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is necessary, but sometimes he goes too far.- Hanging on to gravity-defying deadly raptor-like dinosaurs anyone?- Leaping from crashing speeder-bikes that are described as waaaay too fast to really allow such a thing?- The occasional unexpected introduction of a new central character that by all rights should at least have been mentioned before?Otoh, you will remember some little inventions of Mr. Abnett long after you've finished reading the stories. The coded language, the long and superbly drawn-out battle of wills between one man and one daemon. The self-sacrifice and the pride. The rise of man and the fall of man.A timeless classic that deserves the full treatment of the people who did the CGI Final Fantasy feature movie. Or the Peter Jackson treatment. Or a full set of Computer Game adaptations.Bravo, Mr. Abnett. Bravo. Your courage in letting this body of work stand, without resurrecting the main character, is admirable. And rest assured, though you may lose the rights to that character, no-one will ever equal what you created.",

Since this is the topic that invariably arises when one discussed these books, I feel that this is the primary issue I must address in this review.I recently read an interview with Mr. Goodkind in which he discussed his writing process, his views on philosophy, and how he incorporates them into his work, among other things. In it, he made a number of comments that struck me as telling indicators of what you'll find in Naked Empire.1. Mr. Goodkind stated that rather than tell a pre-conceived story as he believes it would unfold, he instead comes up with a moral or philosophical statement he'd like to make, and then crafts the story to fit that tenet. Goodkind is not a world-builder and never has been; the endings of his books have always had the ring of, &quot;Nice work Richard... but our princess is in another castle!&quot; to paraphrase from everyone's favorite plumber-based video game. I've never had a problem with this in the past, since what Goodkind lacks in a cohesive world and story, he makes up for with his wonderful characters.However, his statement in the interview confirms what many readers have been saying over the past few volumes: his books are increasingly becoming vehicles for Goodkind's philosophy, and Naked Empire shows that trend increasing exponentially. While the events put forth as the book's main conflict could be intriguing, as the story develop, they seem much more like a setting explicitly constructed to make a tired moral point than one crafted to advance his story.2. One of the main influences for Mr. Goodkind's portrayal of the Bandakar people was the idea put forth by Immanuel Kant that our senses are insufficient to perceive reality as it truly is. The Bandakar are a people who have been sealed away from the rest of the world since the time of the great wizards' war, whose homeland is now exposed to the rest of the world for reasons that will be made clear in the middle of the book. The Bandakar have some impossibly nave views on reality and pacifism, and the fact that Goodkind cites Kant as the forebear of these ideals shows how grossly he misinterpreted what Kant was trying to say.I am as much a proponent of personal responsibility as anyone else, but unfortunately, this book is nothing more than a huge strawman argument. Goodkind sets up a pitiful target that nobody in the real world would defend, and expects us to be awed when Richard knocks it down with the force of reason. The result is not impressive; it's irritating in the extreme.3. Mr. Goodkind calls Ayn Rand the &quot;greatest philosopher since Aristotle.&quot; I'm not even going to touch that, but it should give you a strong idea of what you're in for.About three quarters of the way through this book, I realized something astonishing. I don't like Richard anymore. He was such a wonderful character in the early days of this series, but now he doesn't even seen human. Rather than a compassionate and resourceful man who's overcome many hardships, he comes across as a tiresome ersatz intellectual, and not just when he's addressing the Bandakar. His words are saturated with pedantry even when he's talking to his friends.The book's ending marks another low point in the series. There are three primary problems that Richard must overcome, which I won't name for fear of revealing too much of the story, but while Goodkind prides himself on writing endings that show his characters prevailing through intelligence and resourcefulness, only one of the solutions satisfies in that regard. Of the two disappointments, one is a contrived anticlimax, and the other is a horrible deus ex machina.That said, the upside is that there are still several strong characters here. Zedd, Adie, Nathan, and Ann all have parts to play, and they are still my favorite characters. I still love every minute I get to spend with them. Jagang is as interesting as usual, and Mr. Goodkind gets bonus points for Nicholas the Slide, who is one of the creepiest villains I've read in quite some time.So, the final verdict: Would I recommend this? Maybe. If you're a very dedicated Sword of Truth fan, I think you might want to stay with it if only for the good times spent with the characters not traveling with Richard. Will I give up on the Sword of Truth? Probably not. As much as Richard irritates me now, I still love the other characters, and I haven't given up hope on the series yet. Please, Mr. Goodkind, turn this thing around.",

                "review/text": "It pains me to review Naked Empire, the 8th book in the Sword of Truth series, since I am an avid fan both of Goodkind and the adorable central characters he created in Wizard's First Rule, Richard and Kahlan.Firstly, fantasy fans beware. This book is not packed with the usual action and world buidling of fantasy sagas. Now, Goodkind was never one to conform to the rules of typical fantasy books, but this book is a rule all onto itself. More than two thirds of it consists of tedious preaching on behalf of Richard to less enlightened souls about the value of life ... and consequently the justification for murder! Not only do I have trouble swallowing the mind-numbingly tripe &quot;philosophies&quot; of Richard, I find his conclusions incredulous.I would have been able to forgive dubious values and even a speech or two by Richard if the plot were more forgiving. Unfortunately, and it is highly unfortunate, it seems like Goodkind has lost the plot. Where is the action? The plot is so thin that it can be related in two short sentences: Richard converts a bunch of non-magical misfits to his beliefs by saving them from evil occupation. And, oh yeah, he also finds out how to control his gift. There you go.Harldy an effort worthy of Goodkind. And my question to Goodkind is: do YOU deserve victory?The plots and characters just aren't explored. Nicholas the Slide is too obvious - you know from the start that Betsy the goat is going to be a pain in the behind (literally), and Jenssen, Richard's half sister, is frankly too annoying.Goodkind spends the first 150 pages bringing readers up to speed on the plot thus far. This should tell you something of the value of Naked Empire as a book in its own right ... Life is too valuable to spend time reading this book.The read was painful, my review is painful. I'm sure that Goodkind is feeling the pain too. By no means deserving of victory (nor my money).",

                "review/text": "Goodkind is all for \"moral clarity,\" so I have to put this bluntly. The book is terrible. The plot is advanced perhaps a millimeter in hundreds of pages. Why, you ask? So that we may have the great fortune of listening to Mr. Goodkind rant his sub-Ayn Randian Objectivism for page after page. The ideas espoused are spoken with the conviction a Hitler youth--just as naively self-assured, just as accepting (embracing) of violence. I am all for individual responsibility, freedom, etc., but to have them preached to me page after page in such a clumsy and didactic fashion (your childhood Sunday School teacher was more elegant and eloquent than Richard's speeches on the subjects) almost made me convert to the Skinnerian behaviorism of Walden Two. In fact, if it weren't for the disturbing and discordant brutality of Richard and his enemies, I would say that this was intended as a social indoctrination for children, like those contrived Victorian-era morality tales. He truly could not have had an adult audience in mind, could he?The story--if you want to call it that--involved Richard being poisoned, finding a group of people that lack \"moral clarity\" (read \"peaceniks\" or \"hippies\" here--two groups that the author obviously loathes) and searching for the antidote. During this time he suffers nausea and headaches. Nothing could be less interesting than hearing repeatedly about a character suffering nausea and headaches, and I wish someone would have pointed this seemingly obvious fact out before the book was published. Richard's wife, Kahlan, again plays the fool and gets herself captured. There is a new evil wizard (boo! hiss!) that can steal the souls of the people he impales on sticks. He then uses these souls somehow to control large black birds and goats (though why he does not simply put his own spirit into them without placing people onto sticks is not made known to us, and I doubt Mr. Goodkind knows either). There is a girl that has no magic that keeps company with a goat. Not only does she have no magic, she has no character, and has nothing to do with the story. The goat, being a goat, should probably not be a main character in a novel, but this is a decision left to Mr. Goodkind.At times the writing makes you want to laugh out loud. When the evil wizard has placed people on sticks so that he can fly in big birds, the dialogue becomes exactly what you read in \"Fun with Dick and Jane.\" \"Look, look. See, see. It is good to go up. It is fun to go down.\" I know you think I exaggerate, but you can verify this for yourself if you wish. The arguments for the capitalist and objectivist philosophy are not fun to read. They ramble on and on, and the points they make are trivial at best. The characters act, conveniently, only in ways that bolster the arguments. In fact, they are not really human characters at all; they are pieces of cardboard, cut out and smeared clumsily with black or white finger paints. The good people are wholly good--perfect and sainted. The evil people are absolutely and totally evil--they have no redeeming merits and hate even their own mommies. In short, they are all contrivances.The outcome is a forgone conclusion. I could not ruin it for you because it is too obvious. I cannot say that it was satisfying. Nothing about this puerile work really was. I know that sounds harsh. But as a new convert to the righteous Mr. Goodkind's vision of \"moral clarity\", I have to call it what it is.",

Yes I absolutely loved WIZARD'S FIRST RULE and many of the volumes following, but there comes a time where its all been said and there's nothing new left to do with a story. Unfortunately for Sword of Truth that was about three books ago.You want a short synopsis of this volume? Ok, Richard gets poisoned and must free some pitiful wimps to get an antidote; the emperor gins up a new magical creature (the worst yet!); zed gets captured and the Keep is taken; Kahlan is captured; Zed is freed; Kahlan is freed; Richard saves himself and the magical creature is done away with. Yeah! Now fluff that up to about a thousand pages, nine hundred of them being incredibly boring lectures about the evils of collectivism and how magic works and you have NAKED EMPIRE.I suppose I am a bit bitter but I resent the fact that a story I really liked, and I really liked WIZARD'S FIRST RULE, has been turned into some hacks, word-spill, fluff piece. I also resent having this volume palmed off as something new when it really isn't.

Of course, if TG would never have written POC, he wouldn't have had to write this. He could have just moved the actual plot of the series forward as it looks like he will do in the next book.While NE did provide some entertaining moments, which is why it got 2 stars instead of 1, there was entirely too much time devoted on back-filling in the story for those people who hadn't read the other books in the series. Come on - this is book 8 - if they start here, they should just read the other books if they want to know what happened before.This book had many repetitive elements from previous books. Once again, there is a new threat that previously didn't exist, and that we'd never heard of. Once again Richard is taken captive. Once again, every word Richard says looks like there was an entire team of speechwriters who gave him a script and he read directly from it. Once again, the main villian who is supposed to be supremely intelligent, appears to have made a breakthrough only to stupidly relinquish his advantage yet again.The overall plot of the series - the conflict with the Imperial Order - is more or less in exactly the same place it was after book 6. Books 7 and 8 were completely side plots, and it seems clear the book 7 was written so he could write book 8. It is clear we could do without either of them, and not miss a beat in the overall plot.The end was extremely predictable, and it is really starting to get old seeing Richard's gift, which he doesn't know how to use, but ultimately uses based on his 'need', do absolutely anything he could possibly need it to in order to get himself out of the jam at the end. Not very creative writing there.All in all, if it hadn't been for the previous book which was so monumentally bad, this book would have been the worst of the series along with Soul of the Fire, which also had a few moments of good stuff.There doesn't appear to be any obvious new threat leading into the next book, so let's hope we finally start moving toward an overall conclusion to the major plotline in the next one.",

You ain't getting that emotion here or in the previous two books.Actually, I'm wrong, there is one point in the book where that kind of emotion did briefly make an appearance.

                "review/text": "Book 8 of the Sword of TruthAfter a one book digression to focus on a different character (Jennsen Rahl), The Sword of Truth series returns to put the focus back on Richard Rahl. Naked Empire begins shortly after the end of Pillars of Creation. By shortly after I mean within a couple of hours in the timeline of the series. Jennsen has finally met up with Richard and has learned that she is his half-sister and that Richard really is a good guy (something we've known for the 6 books before POC). We have learned something about Jennsen. She is what is called \"pristinely ungifted\". This means that she cannot see magic nor can it directly affect her. The reason for this has to do with the Rahl family, but it would take several paragraphs to explain. With Jennsen together with Richard and Kahlan, they can continue their quest deep into the Empire of the Old World.That's the set up. Here's the delivery:Richard is being tracked by strange, large black birds called races. The races are not doing much more than following (a rare attack), so Richard knows that someone is using the races to find out where he is going and what he is doing. Talking with Kahlan he mentions a book he was reading called \"The Pillars of Creation\", and it has to do with the Pristinely Ungifted like Jennsen. Apparently there was a whole lot of them several thousand years ago and they were all banished to the Old World. That's all anyone really knows about them. Naturally, this means that we're going to see their descendents (they are actually the Empire in the title, not that of Jagang). Richard is also suffering from extreme headaches that reflect the growing of Richard's gift.Richard and company meet up with an old man who tries to convince Richard to save his people from the Empire. Richard explains that he only explains the options to people and exhorts them to rise up themselves because Richard cannot do everything himself nor does he feel the responsibility to help those who won't help themselves. Richard preaches self-empowerment. The man doesn't quite understand and it is revealed that he poisoned Richard to convince him to save his people.You can guess how this plays out and who this man's people actually are. Now that we are back to the main storyline, things get moving along a little bit more. The point of view switches between Richard in the Old World and Zedd back in the New World. One of my favorite things about this series (in a very twisted way) is how Terry Goodkind does not spare his characters anything. They must endure torture and extreme suffering and in the end we still believe it when they are able to overcome the situation they find themselves in. The only question I have is something that has been questioned in other series: Will it ever end? I don't see where Goodkind is going with the Sword of Truth series and I don't see that it is really moving to a resolution anytime soon. On the other hand, this is also a series that can be wrapped up in any one book. The amazing thing about this series is that every single book is a self-contained novel that has its own story arc while it advances the series story arc. Each novel is a solid offering and is strong on its own.",

This book takes it's moral, and beats you about the head with it. And as the ideas in the story are mentioned ad naseum, it's actually a severe blow to the head, repeated often. If you break down the book into action vs. expostion, you get about 100 pages of action, and 566 pages of exposition. Actually most of the expostion is just the same thing over, and over, and over again. So what you really get is 300 pages of exposition, repeated. I don't know if Mr. Goodkind thinks his reading audience is dumb, or just wants to rest on his laurels, but you should never subject someone who has laid down their hard earned money to this kind of trash. I can safely say that after having been enamored with this series now for many years, I won't be reading the rest of the series.

I enjoyed this book very much because I can understand him.

Coulthart tries his hand at \"Dunwich\" but admits he couldn't really improve on Enrique Breccia's in \"Heavy Metal\" magazine, so stops halfway through the story. (See Breccia's \"Lovecraft\" for more of his work.) It ends with a nice splash, though. Coulthart's most proud of his \"Call of Cthulhu\", which is hard to read because he breaks up the frames into odd angles to mimic the \"horrible geometries\" described in the story. This adds to the mystery of the story and a growing sense of horror as the pieces come together, an achievement unique to the comic medium. However, I'm convinced that Lovecraft's own effects are ultimately dependent upon the written word's ability to conceal things from and gradually reveal things to the reader's imagination, to tease us out of all rational thought. They just can't be equalled in another medium. Another jewel of \"Haunter\", though, is the portfolio of Lovecraftian \"gods\" that follows the stories. Coulthart uses the computer to combine, among other things, some of Ernst Haeckel's \"Art Forms of Nature\" etchings with his own drawing. Coulthart's not the first person to make this connection. It's well known that Lovecraft admired Haeckel's philosophy, and others have dabbled with using Haeckel's illustrations to evoke the creatures HPL describes in his stories. But Coulthart really commits to the connection. One only wishes he had given some credit to Haeckel. After this portfolio (with its nonsensical \"evocations\" by Moore) comes a collection of controversial \"Lord Horror\" illustrations. They are both prurient and puerile -- I damn them with my alliteration! HPL is most effective when trying to maintain dignity as well as sanity in the face of overwhelming cosmic terror, which is itself \"dignified\" in its own horrible (to human eyes) way, just of another, perhaps even loftier order.",

Several plates out Coulthart's \"Call of Cthulhu\" will probably be familiar to new readers, having appeared in other Lovecraft publications, and his \"Haunter of the Dark\" creates an equally brooding atmosphere filled with obsessively detailed images. Beyond that, there are ten fairly good, though sometimes gory pages on \"The Dunwich Horror,\" set up in story-board fashion.Then things really deteriorate: thirty-plus pages of elaborately swirly but atmospherically bland graphics devoted to the Mythos deities, accompanied by the babbling, Anglo-apocalyptic prose poems of Alan Moore, and twenty-five pages of the artist's non-Lovecraftian work for David Britton's \"Lord Horror\" series, which resemble the obsessively detailed and sadistic pen and ink drawings of some gifted teenage horror fan. The artist suggests a plausible linkage between the grimly stylized concentration camp architecture in several of these and Lovecraft's own apocalyptic vision, but many readers, I suspect, will find the results obscenely offensive. One can see how this stuff attracted the attention of British censors in the nineties, and it is irritating to find Lovecraft's name prominently displayed on the cover of a book that eventually strays so far from the spirit of his work. My inclination would be to look for the \"Haunter\" and \"Cthulhu\" series in another graphic-fiction anthology (maybe it's already out there); as it is, I would not recommend this as a gift for any Lovecraft-loving young person.",

                "review/text": "It's aptly named; violence is all it's about. There is none of the finesse, characterizations or political subtleties that made the previous Rogue Warrior novels, co-authored by John Weisman, so entertaining and - yes - uplifting.Marcinko is a bona fide warrior - a BTDT whose two non-fiction books, Leadership Secrets, and Strategies for Success, are permanent installations in my home library. His original book, Rogue Warrior, the autobiography, is another keeper - one of the most inspirational and motivating I've ever read.Unfortunately, Violence of Action makes a mockery of all that went before. It's cartoonish in its simplicity, gratuitously violent without any redeeming qualities, and mouthily preachy without being the least bit inspiring. When one of Demo Dick's teammates died, in prior books, you really cared... about them, their families, the SEAL community. Not so in Violence of Action; I kept wishing someone would shoot either the characters or me and put me out of my misery.I am crazy about Commander Richard Marcinko. I have the utmost respect for all that he's accomplished, all that he's survived, and the kind of life he's lived. Yes, he's rough around the edges and I probably wouldn't want to bring him home to meet my mother, but he also has the courage of his convictions, which is rare today.Please don't judge his abilities by this book; it is NOT a good representation (although a lot of his detractors would say it is) of the Rogue Warrior character. There is none of the self-deprecating humor found in the earlier works.It begs the question whether Mr. Weisman was the driving force behind the other bestsellers.",

                "review/text": "I was surprised when I found out that there was another Rogue Warrior novel coming out, since John Weisman had replied to an e-mail I had written him, stating that he was not going to write any more novels in the series. Apparently, he had been doing the vast majority, if not all of the work on the previous novels, with Marcinko simply giving feedback and approval, which would explain why Violence of Action is so different than the rest of the series.Although Violence of Action is lacking in plot intricacy and character development, it makes up for it somewhat in the action department - which is literally non-stop and definitely lives up to the book's title.As for the people who complained about the torture that occurs in the book - they need to realize that there are situations where such measures, however distasteful, are absolutely necessary and justified. Especially when you're talking about millions of innocent lives. Consider the fact that the individuals being interrogated were guilty of conspiring to murder hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians for the sake of starting a race war, and that timely intelligence was essential to prevent that from happening. If you had loved ones trapped in a city about to be nuked and their lives depended on you obtaining that information as fast as possible, what would you have done? If you'd have spared a terrorist rather than try to save those people, you need to seriously examine your ethics, because frankly, they're irrational.",

                "review/text": "Anybody thinking Dick Marchinco had become an anachronism got a wake-up call on 9/11 of last year. Arguably, that included Marchinco himself, since his recent books, while still lots of fun to read, had become formula-driven - not really the work of a man feeling himself in tune with his times. However, with Violence in Action, Demo Dick is back with us in lethal force, invigorated once again with the purpose of his life. It's the best book he's produced since the original Rogue Warrior appeared more than a decade ago. While the distinctive Rogue voice will be recognizable to readers of this series, many of the formulaic elements are diminished or gone - the rambling asides, the sarcastic portraits of inept bureaucrats, the convoluted accounts of global detective work, punctuated by stylized bursts of action, as Dick and his boys unravel some new terrorist conspiracy. Violence of Action, in contrast, proceeds without digression, like a cannon shot from page one to the end. Surprisingly, Marchino chooses not to exploit the mood of the times here to cast Islamic militants as his villains. His Bad Guys are American white supremacists who spout mystical gibberish about Yahweh and have seized a nuclear device with which they plan to incinerate Portland, Oregon. Moreover, they're not only home-grown Americans, but former Navy Seals - blood brothers to Dick - who have drifted way off the reservation and betrayed everything he holds holy. The fury with which he hunts them down is unprecedented in anything he's written. There's a graphic torture scene early in the book that I could have done without and that most readers will find abhorrent. However, Dick doesn't revel in the ugly business - he simply describes it - and he seems to be making a philosophical point of sorts, since the information extracted from one thug's pain, in the end, saves the lives of half a million or so innocents. Ironically, in this most furious of his books, Marchinco seems finally to have wrapped his testosterone-addled brain around the idea of females in the military: both the fiercest warrior on his new combat team, and his new boss, whom he honestly respects, are women. Who says that Old Rogues are set in their attitudes? Anyone who reads Marchinco either loves him or hates him - he destroys all middle ground. His fans will be enthralled by this book, and to them I recommend it.",

This one is a bit more graphic in its descriptions: see Chapter 8 (the interrogation) to understand what I mean, but for true fans of the series, it'll be SSDD as compared previous books in the series and the extra gore will be welcome. Other minor differences are that the \"Ten Commandments\" and almost all of the characters of old are gone. This makes me wonder if Marcinko doesn't fully own the copyright on them which means that he couldn't use them. Oddly enough, the chapter intro quotes range from everyone from Napoleon to Sun Tzu to...Pink!Regardless of how its format diverges from previous books in the series, the story is a good: a stolen pocket nuke being used to terrorize Portland, President Bush and other White House staffers hang him out to dry, etc. However this time around, he's shooting and looting while on a presidential pardon which gives him carte blanche to do what he wants. Ah, finally!As other reviewers have remarked, the story length is a bit short, which is ironic considering the self-professed size of his, uhm, uh...you know. After ten novels, the series is starting to run out of steam, but it's still quite enjoyable. Now UNODIR, go and read this book!",

Second, it skipped between first and third person, which is confusing and how would the rogue know what the bad guys were doing, anyway? Third, there was a lot of familiar material--and bunches of cliches. Fourth, the writing was lame. There was none of the usual subltety or self-mocking humor.

This book ignores everything RM preaches about being true to your convictions etc. Not only is much shorter, minus Mr Weisman but it's about as funny as root canal. Yes the previous 9 books were basically the same story, but what made them brilliant was the great characters/sidekicks and RM's wonderfully self-mocking humour that showed he was first to send himself up. This has NONE of either of them - it's po-faced, played straight and utterly dull. It gives the impression RM was under pressure from his publisher to churn out another Rogue Warrior book so he just cobbled together a patch job from previous manuscripts - assuming he wrote the thing at all, which I am suspicious about given the sudden &amp; dramatic drop in quality (unless that quality actually came from Weisman). The 1st 9 are laugh out loud funny rollicking reads - this one is a waste of time. Let's hope with #11 he brings back Weisman, the sidekicks and the wit.",

The constant filthy language, the neverending nonsense about the Rogue's own personal ten commandments, the always present, always identical, comments on pain and winning that meander through action scenes: It has all become boring. The Rogue himself has become a cartoonish character, sort of like a mean Elmer Fudd, getting hit with brick walls and run over by trains, but magically bouncing back up and repeating pretty much the same words over and over, except the Rogue's words are mostly curses.There really isn't much in the way of plot in this short novel. There isn't even a hint of interesting dialogue. There's just the Rogue, who doesn't know it's time to retire and let someone else same the nation and write the books.",

This one seems like everyone--the author, the publisher, and maybe even us as fans--want to recreate the past greatness, and, based on this effort, it's not happening.",

Rosemond's book is written in an easy-to-read manner, but ends up long on chat (like an overly long column) and short on cites. Nevertheless, Rosemond's opinion on methods of parenting and discipline, as he has shown in other successful books like Parent Power, is worth something standing alone. An emphatic reminder that we, as parents, are the first line of defense against the violence marketed to children, Rosemond's book does a nice job discussing the importance of teaching children personal, task and social responsibility. His ideas regarding limitations to be set on video games, computer use and television are also quite helpful. One need be neither Judeo-Christian nor an arch conservative to see the value of some of Rosemond's views on parenting however, and it would have been nice not to have to wade through Rosemond's rather strident (and often offensively presented)political beliefs and his personal religious beliefs to get to his larger point regarding the benefits of authoritative, as opposed to authoritarian or permissive parenting. I would recommend people buy Parent Power, which covers much of the same ground and is available in paperback -- and skip this latest book which doesn't add much that is new to Rosemond's previous body of work.",

And it is an easy read, and entertaining. I would have liked to have seen less personal anecdotes and more of the real research and studies that are out there; that he seemed to gloss over, in favor of levity.The book does contain useful information, especially towards the end. I had the thought that if he BEGAN again, with the ending of this book to begin a new one and fleshed it out a bit more, it would have more of an impact. This is a good basic book, but I would have liked it to have been a bit more scholarly.",

You won't hear his wisdom or common sense from any other authors. If you are looking for psychobabble, look elsewhere. If you think children should be coddled and babied all the way into adulthood (like \"everyone else\" seems to be doing now), then this isn't for you. If you think children need to be ridiculously praised for every move they make, you should really read this book - it debunks that notion, and turns most other conventional parenting practices of today upside down. Just look at your neighbors and the classmates of your children, who are likely helpless, disrespectful, often overweight, addicted to tv and video games, etc. I don't want my kids to be like that, so John Rosemond has shown me the better way, which is actually the way I was parented, without even realizing it.The book was a fascinating read, and I went through it quickly. At that point the only other book of his I had read was Making the Terrible Twos Terrific, and while it is the same general philosophies, there was much new wisdom in this book, particularly for older children. I loaned it to my sister who also enjoyed it.When visiting a friend in another state, who had a girl my son's age, she was so violent that we finally left after an hour. She actually flipped a glider rocker chair that my son was sitting in over and on top of him. I later sent this book to my friend, hoping she wouldn't be offended. She read it and told me it was very useful and helped her realize what she was doing wrong with her kids, and immediately upon putting his wisdom in practice she saw improvement, and began working on being a leader/parent, instead of a slave to her kids.",
