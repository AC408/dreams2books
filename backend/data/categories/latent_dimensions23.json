                "review/text": "Rosemary Wells is known for her commitment to children's literacy. Her \"Read to your Bunny\" campaign rolled out across the country a few years ago. Wells addressed a group of librarians recently and passionately discussed the education challenges facing our schools and our nation. Young children are struggling more than ever in school. The reasons are numerous and familiar to most of us. Rather than continue to bewail the whys and wherefores of the issue, she used a brilliant analogy to explain what we need to do.She pointed out that if a building was on fire and hundreds of people needed to be saved it would take the clear voice of a fireman, issuing simple commands to evacuate everyone to safety. (Instead of dithering about discussing why the fire started and how fires really are a problem for certain kinds of structures, the important thing is to get safely away.)Her book \"My Shining Star: Raising a Child who is Ready to Learn\" was written with input from teachers and librarians all around the country. Wells lists ten virtues which parents should promote to prepare their child for the most wonderful adventure of all, education.She addresses parents in the preface:\"All children bring to school what they learn at home.This book is about creating a home full of harmonyand the preparation of a successful child.You are your child's first teacher.\"Her virtues include Respect, Listening, Patience, Trust, Work, Honesty, Time (\"Children spell love T - I - M - E,\") Reading, Writing, and Habits.This little book is only 13 pages long and only has about 25 words (at most) per page. Wells's lovely rabbit drawings warmly illustrate each virtue. She lays out a path for raising a child who is ready for school. It seems so simple and so obvious but so many children arrive in Kindergarten ill-equipped to learn.If you know a family with young children, present them with a copy of this tiny treasure.This little book is going to be my gift to new parents along with Goodnight Moon and a Mother Goose book.During her speech she also related a story about a principal she knows who works tirelessly to awaken parents to the needs of their children. He tells them to \"Grow up! Pay attention! Be Responsible for your child!\" I did not know that, nationally, only 26% of all parents attend their kids' Open House or Back to School nights.The alarm has sounded and Rosemary Wells has given us ten simple steps to help children get ready to learn.",

                "review/text": "In \"My Shining Star: Raising a Child Who is Ready to Learn,\" it's parents who learn what's important when it comes to raising their kids and getting them ready for school. This book features ten simple, but very important lessons that can be a cornerstone for raising kindly, well-mannered children.The book starts right off with Rule #1 --- Respect. It says basically that when children are treated with respect, they will have self-respect and will learn to have respect for others. Another great rule is #6 --- Honesty, which says that children need to be taught to respect the truth and see justice used at home.Never heavy-handed, but plainly put, these lessons are golden. The book of the book contains endorsements from Robert Coles (a child psychologist at Harvard University) and Jason Kamras (2005 Teacher of the Year.) But I think after you read it, one if its biggest endorsers will be you. The book is illustrated in the familiar Rosemary Wells style, using her classic rabbit characters seen in book such as \"Read to Your Bunny.\"",

That's how it seemed to me, at least.Instead of describing kindergarten as a fun, happy, loving place, it talks about how children are at first afraid, but then learn to like it. Why even suggest that your child should be afraid?Worse, in the book, all the parents stay in the classroom, outside the door watching. That's not how school works. The parents are not there, so why suggest that they are going to be at the door looking in during the day?Not recommended. The other \"night before\" books I like, just not this one.",

If parents are crying, a 5-year-old does not need to be burdened with this. In the book, the parents stayed at school, crying and watching, while the kids did about a dozen activities! That is totally not realistic. In fact, the crying parents (and the children setting THEM at ease with a final goodbye and hug and wave) seemed to occupy the bulk of the book, instead of focusing on how the child is getting bigger, and going to like school, etc., etc.",

He likes the cats who live in the temple, and is always losing his sandals because he has to take them off before he goes into the temple and forgets where he left them. -- And Thi Lien, in Vietnam who wears beautiful batik died traditional clothes made by her mother, helps feed the families chickens and harvest rice, and collects firewood. -- And Celina, who lives in the Amazon Rain Forrest of Brazil in a mud brick two room hut. She likes to paint herself with die made from a local root every day, and has never worn shoes. She likes to take the canoe out on the river her family lives near.There is information about each child's favorite activities, what they eat, what they wear, pictures of thier home, family members, religious practices, and special things about thier cultures. This book has many children from Australia, Africa, The Americas, The Philipenes, Europe, Asia, India, and more. I have enjoyed looking at all the childred in this book and reading about how they live. Even though it's for children, anyone can enjoy this book. I only wish it had more children to meet.

Many of the pictures are in fact outdated now. But my chief complaint is that the buyer understand as I did not- this is not an atlas-accurate depiction of children by percent population in each country; it is actually more a compilation of minority cultures. The example children from the United States reveals this. For example, p. 6-7 show sample kids from several countries, some with typical appearances and names for their country like Yannis from Greece, Guo Shuang from China etc, but the US shows five children: two which appear hispanic (Nicole and Carlos), one eskimo, one unusual-looking chunky caucasian girl and one African American male with a seriously outdated hairdo and parachute pants. On the Americas page there is an entire line up of children, 24 in all, and only two caucasian kids in the whole line-up, which is a little odd. There are two eskimo children given two whole pages from the US and Canada (no other children from Canada- apparently they are all Inuit), where other countries with proportionately way more children like China do not get that much coverage. I unfortunately cannot tell if the children from the other countries are represented correctly, but the US is over-represented in general, as all the other countries have only 1 or 2 children. Tbe publishers should have left out so many extraneous US children, two children of ANY race would've been sufficient. I guess Australia's in the same boat as Canada as the only child represented is Aborigine, which is great to learn about, but not entirely a fair depiction of the continent. Oh well. The idea for the book is really cute, and the book is published with UNICEF, and when the subtitle says \"a unique celebration of children around the world\" they really mean it. Since this book functions similar to an atlas, it's a bit outdated,as mentioned.

Every time we get to the part in the book where the little girl approaches the stranger in the car, my nephew tells me \"that's a no-no.\" He doesn't seem scared or anxious, yet he's learned the important central lesson of the book.One of the co-authors is a psychologist and she's obviously taken great pains to make sure the tone of the book is exactly right for young readers.

        "description": "A parent's love is absolutely essential, but there comes a point when it alone is not sufficient -- when the epiccenter of acceptance shifts from home to school, from family to peer. This practical, persuasive guide shows parents how to raise their children so that they will be popular -- well liked by their peers. Social competence in children of all ages, Marano says, is not a luxury. Rather, it has an essential impact on a child's later life -- on his or her health, happiness, intellectual capacity, and above all, success. But how can parents foster the qualities and skills shared by every popular child? And what can mothers and fathers do when their youngsters stumble, struggle, or suffer? This friendly, impressively researched, and enormously informative guide explores a wide range of issues and concerns including: The perils of overprotective -- how to safeguard children without smothering them, and how to turn a shy boy or girl into a confident kid Good kids, bad kids, and outsiders -- who gets picked on, why schoolyard cruelty hurts everyone, and what a parent can do when a child is having trouble Peer pressure and interpersonal solutions -- how children learn to interact, from the playpen to the playground and beyond, and how parents can foster crucial social skills at every age Temperamanent and tantrums -- why youngster act up, from the Terrible Twos to teenage rebellion, what such behavior means in different situations, and how parents can turn conflict into cooperation Prescriptive and practical, \"Why Doesn't Anybody Like Me?\" offers parents down-to-earth advice on everything from helping their children make new friends to managing schoolyard bullies. Marano's perceptive insights are powerful psychological strategies parents can use help their children build the interpersonal skills that will carry them through life that form the core of every strong friendship, every satifying marriage, and every successful business partnership.",

She explains in detail what makes a child well liked by other children and what not.

For these categories, the author describes how differences in parenting styles and methods can contribute to a child receiving a particular label.As a parent of a toddler and a preschooler, this book helped me to understand how I can contribute to my children's social development in a meaningful way. Topics such as the importance of free play vs. organize classes, and how to help the developing brain learn to manage emotions were particularly helpful. I feel lucky to have read the book early in my children's lives, since I now have some specific tools for helping my child become socially confident.The author makes it clear that social issues arise early, and can stick with a child for life. Unfortunately, the book provides little guidance for parents of older children who are struggling, and how to change. In that regard, the title seems to be somewhat misleading -- unless you consider your children to be \"raised\" when they hit kindergarten! Also, the book is far from a \"guide\".

This is a lovely book with colorful photographs. Russ obviously has DS but it is never mentioned in the story. I can't begin to say how much that means to me as the mother of a DS child. These stories truly show the way children with DS are LIKE other children rather than dwelling on how they are different. What a great message! I highly recommend it for all children, especially those with DS or who may have a child with DS in their class at school. The books are hard cover with glossy photos and are very well constructed in addition to being terrific stories.

He covers how they are recruited, abducted or conscripted, trained and finally set off to fight in whatever hot spot is active at the moment.The one surprising thing about this book is that it treats this as a new problem. War has always been a young persons game. To read the biographies of woldiers of World War II, a surprising number lied about their age to join the army at fifteen or sixteen years of age. In the American Civil War around 100,000 soldiers were fifteen or younger. A surprising, but unknown number were under ten. The pictures of the end of the Third Reich show young boys greeting Hitler. The first American killed in Afghanistan was shot by a 14 year old sniper.On the other hand, by bringing attention to the fact that our Army will have to face children in the battlefield Dr. Singer may help prepare our forces and our public for the real world.",

Had anyone read more widely they would have discovered that 'Children at War' is a piece of pseudo-scholarship. This book is based upon a completely misguided assumption - that the involvement of children in warfare is a new phenomenon. In making such an assertion the author reveals either lack of any proper engagement with the literature or simply bad faith. The sad fact is that children have been involved as solidiers in many, if not most, of the wars recorded in history. In spite of Singer's erroneous claims to the contrary, the US Civil War involved large numbers of boy soldiers. Similarly the First World War. Children fought and died with the partisans in Nazi-occupied Europe, and so on. Towards the end of the book, Singer reveals a disturbing political agenda. It seems that his real concern is less with child soldiers and more with the challenges for US troops faced with children in places like Afghanistan and Iraq where killing them is bad for morale and also looks so bad to the folks back home watching CNN.In terms of sources, Singer relies overwhelmingly on journalistic accounts that are simply intended to offer shock value to their readers and, like his own book, lack any deeper engagement with the history and context within which child recruitment takes place. Aside from one quote, none of the copious quotes from child soldiers seems to have come from Singer's one fieldwork. Indeed, the reader is left wondering if Singer has ever actually visited a setting where child recruitment takes place.This is a work of truly poor scholarship. It is a mystery how it ever got published and why so many people have been apparently taken in by it. Perhaps it is a case of telling people what they want to hear?If anyone is looking for a proper discussion of this subject they would do far better to read David Rosen's 'Armies of the Young'.",

In the first years of the new millennium, we rarely find state-led armies clashing across the boarders of sovereign nations. Rather, most wars occur within the boarders of an autonomous state. Civil and guerrilla conflicts have replaced the international and colonial wars of the recent past. All too often, the armies fueling these new internal struggles for power are composed of children.Dr. Singer has created an excellent and through study of the new phenomenon of children at war. Singer looks at the variety of ways that child soldiers are recruited across cultural and political arenas, the perceived benefits of child soldiers to their political patrons, and the long-term repercussions of inundating the world's children in to an existence based upon violence and death.Singer's work is based upon personal interviews with child soldiers, adults involved in the raging conflicts, as well as international aid agencies, the UN and others closely involved in the \"new warfare.\" Such a work is an invaluable contribution to the emerging cannon on the changing face of warfare. Only with such studies will the world begin to see the problems of children at war, but also begin to create solutions.",

Singer's work is an incredibly valuable contribution to further the study and understanding of armed conflict in the post Cold War-era. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the welfare of children and the state of our world in often-neglected locations such as sub-Saharan Africa.

Training children as young as 12 to kill without mercy and to be used as cannon fodder to shield adult soldiers sounds like some crazy vision of a dark future. Singer, however, builds a strong case that this dark future is here. It would be easy to blame this on one or two sadistic tyrants, but Singer shows how a confluence of global factors have led to this situation. What to do with these children when the fighting ends, or when they are rescued from a war zone is a challenge that the global community is just beginning to recognize. While the author does what he can to recommend a solution to this problem, there are no obvious solutions. This may not win an award for \"Feel Good Book of the Year,\" but it should be a contender for \"Most Important Book of the Year.\"",

HOWEVER ... there is something to be said for misleading statements. Pages such as \"everybody knows the Easter Bunny\" can open the lines of communication between parent and child at an early and CRITICAL stage in a toddler/preschool childs life.TALK TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT SAFETY -- don't wait or wish that a book will do it for you!!! If you expect a book to teach your child right from wrong or about not talking to strangers, you are sadly mistaken.Reading to your children is a fundamental and entertaining way to continue to build the bonds of trust between you and your child. You SHOULD read this book to your kids and then explain to them that not all can be trusted but that it is worth the time to know and understand the difference and proper manners.The excellent illustrations and clever rhymes will build a continuity for your child. I remember reading this book when I was in kindergarten and now years later, I still believe that it is a good read. Times haven't changed much when it comes to who you can and can't trust.Be smart, take the time to talk to your kids about who can and can't be trusted, but don't blame the message and disregard it completely. That is one thing that won't change ... \"NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS\".",

It taught me to be careful about strangers -- it actually scared me a bit, because I was afraid that if I talked to a stranger, he might kill me and chop me up in little pieces. But, it is a good lesson for kids to learn (especially nowadays), the pictures are fun, and the story is fun to read (and be read to).Edit:Thanks for the alert from other posters, I purchased from one of Amazon's resellers and got the old edition with the charming illustrations that I loved. My son is still too young to understand the lessons of this book (and now I'm having some reservations about that, he's such an outgoing, charming child and I don't want that to change ... maybe I'll temper that lesson with \"don't talk to strangers if mommy or daddy isn't with you\") and we enjoy sitting and looking at all the funny creatures in the pictures.

        "description": "LEARN TO MEET THE NEEDS OF YOUR GIFTED CHILD Though academic abilities have always been important in determining whether your child is gifted, talent in the visual or performing arts, leadership qualities, and intellectual curiosity are just as vital. But unless we as parents help nurture those talents, our gifted children can become bored, socially aggressive, or, ironically, underachievers in the classroom. Here is a practical, informative, and authoritative primer for raising and educating our gifted children from pre-school to adolescence. Beginning with sensible strategies to determine whether--and in which areas--your child is gifted, this book takes parents through selecting an appropriate day-care center, a school, and a home reference library. It helps us figure out where our role stops and the school's role begins, as well as detailing ways to keep our children's creativity alive and how to cope with sibling rivalry and our own doubts and fears. Also included are a recommended reading list, a special section on the roles of the computer and television in your gifted child's life, and much more.",

All other differences--size, race, nationality, disability, are just part of the human experience, according to Kathie Snow in this wonderful book. What a refreshing viewpoint! Challenging parents to see their children as regular human beings who have much to offer, and are not defined just by their disability, Kathie then guides parents through the process of changing how others view their child. A good explanation of 'people first' language will inspire readers to change the way they speak about their child, which will change the way others view him. This is not a book about a specific disability; Kathie speaks from her personal experiences as well as from the experiences of other parents whose children have a variety of disabilities, as she developes a blueprint of how to create positive change for all children. After all, since disability is a part of the human experience, (fifteen to twenty percent of us have one), living with, growing up with, going to school with children who have a disability prepares children without disabilities for real life! And the reality is that 15 to 20 percent of the children of today, will be parents of children with disabilities tomorrow...... what better way to perpare for this than to really get to know children with disabilities in your own childhood? Kathie also suggests that parents and professionals have to work together to meet the needs of children. Pointing out that professionals are people too, she advises parents to get to know the professionals in their child's life, and to build relationships with them, in order to get them to understand the parents' point of view. Parents who believe in inclusion will be affirmed by reading this book. Parents who like the idea of inclusion, but think it wouldn't work for their child, will be inspired by this book. And parents who are afraid of inclusion will be enlightened when they read this work. Anyone who reads 'Disability Is Natural' , will come away with a new perspective on what disability really means.",

I really liked how the author (who also has a child with a disability) describes so many common sense approaches to raising kids to be independent and live the lives of their dreams. This book is very helpful in providing guidance for how parents work positively with educators, medical professionals and others who might approach disability as a situation &quot;to be fixed&quot; with therapy, segregated settings and &quot;no, that's not for you&quot; attitudes. Instead, Ms. Snow talks about natural, inclusive settings and teaching your child to follow their dreams (just like all children). I have never read anything like this, and I learned so much about what to expect as my child goes through elementary school, middle school, high school, and into independent adulthood. It has been very helpful, too, for my parents to read and better understand that our family is as natural as anybody else's.",

Thisis a MUST READ for all parents of children with disabilities!I have ordered so many books that didn't deliver the content that I was looking for. The reviews, the synopsis were grossly exaggerated or just plain wrong.BUT Disability is Natural is different! I am going to require (or try to) my son's future teachers to read `Disability is Natural' over the summer break. I am going to encourage every one of you to order and read this book as soon as possible. Not only will it inspire you, it will give you the tools you have been seeking!Not only does Kathie Snow accurately chronicle the history of disability, the current situations with our special education system and a variety of professional and parental attitudes that affect our children for a lifetime, she then provides the means for preventing history from repeating itself, changing the system, and changing our attitudes as well as other's attitudes.One paragraph that intimately touched me discusses what happens to our children when we have `had enough' of the Special Education System and decided `I quit.' Her estimation is this happens around middle school and high school...I see the burnout occurring much much sooner in many cases, and potentially my case also (until now!)I will excerpt this paragraph here:\"When we've given up advocating, the dangers to our children are great. The middle and high school years are crucially important: they're the springboard for our children entering the adult world of work or post-secondary education. We desperately want out of they system, but since we quit advocating, we must go to the experts for vocational help. At some point, we may no longer have to deal with the system anymore, but our children will. Sadly, if we haven't prepared them for SELF-ADVOCACY, they'll be at the mercy of the experts.\"Now, she doesn't just lecture us on `how we should be thinking' she gives us to tools on `HOW TO DO IT!\"The book turns full circle from the history, where we are today, then HOWto successfully take our children into adult-hood and independence.Kathie helps us explore the natural resources in our community, what are they, how do we get them to work? (another excerpt) \"When we use the system, we have to follow the rules of the system. We must take the single path (eligibility and red tape)...&lt;snip>...In community there is not just one path to take, there are many. There are no rules, no passwords, no gatekeepers. In community, we get what we want and need using the same methods as others: using the existing resources in our cities and towns, depending on friends, networking, calling on old connections and making new ones, offering to give, being creative, thinking out of the box, and being both flexible and persistent.\"You will find practical things that you can actually DO. If your teachers read this book, hopefully their attitudes will change because they will be able to see where we have been, in a different perspective than \"I don't need any more work.\" Perhaps they will feel empowered to `change the system' and we can actually form a team!There are three sections of the book:The Way Things WereThe Way Things AreThe Way Things Can BeUnder the heading of `The Way Things Can Be' there are 11 chapters, I will list their titles here: `A New Paradigm' `People First Language' `Transformation' `Self-Determination' `Tools for Success: Meeting Needs and More' `Natural Lives in Community' `The Early Years' `Inclusive Education: Blueprint for Success' `Homeschooling, Unschooling, Alternative Education' `Bright Future for Teens and Young Adults' `Promoting Positive Images' Leadership and Influence'.These chapters provide the `How To' tools to raise successful children with disabilities. She frequently mentions stories of children with Down syndrome in the book as well as other different abilities.There is a thorough Appendix at the end of the book that lists Disability Organizations from all over the country.So, finally a book that has it all under one cover...yes it is over 600 pages long, and I haven't been able to put it down since it arrived last week! Covering therapy, assistive technology, education, life in the community, and finally leadership (every Disability-Related Organization's employees and Board Members should read this chapter)I will end with a quote from the back cover of the book, \"Bright futures are possible for babies, children, and young adults with disabilities. Let's dream big dreams for our kids and turn those dreams into realities, STARTING NOW!\"",

        "description": "With the first edition of The Hurried Child, David Elkind emerged as the voice of parenting reason, calling our attention to the crippling effects of hurrying our children through life. He showed that by blurring the boundaries of what is age appropriate, by expecting--or imposing--too much too soon, we force our kids to grow up too fast, to mimic adult sophistication while secretly yearning for innocence. In the more than two decades since this book first appeared, new generations of parents have inadvertently stepped up the assault on childhood, in the media, in schools, and at home. In the third edition of this classic (2001), Dr. Elkind provided a detailed, up-to-the-minute look at the Internet, classroom culture, school violence, movies, television, and a growing societal incivility to show parents and teachers where hurrying occurs and why. And as before, he offered parents and teachers insight, advice, and hope for encouraging healthy development while protecting the joy and freedom of childhood. In this twenty-fifth anniversary edition of the book, Dr. Elkind delivers important new commentary to put a quarter century of trends and change into perspective for parents today.",

Children today are under an enormous amount of pressure to act, dress and assume adult roles and responsibilities. This hurrying causes stress in very young children as well as adolescents. I think the book addresses a lot of issues that have negative impact on all children. I learned a great deal about what constitutes hurrying in young children. The author brings forth the fact that hurrying takes place in both the home and school settings. Children are pushed to read earlier than they are developmentally ready; do math and behave in ways that most theorists like Erikson and Piaget have shown to be in direct conflict with children's cognitive and emotional development. The book was excellent in demonstrating the impact of outside influences such as T.V, movies,records and the media on children's development. The achievements and limitations of the major stages of development were long recognised by Piaget on cognitive development and by Erikson on emotional development. The book emphasized that when children's needs become subordinate to parental needs their emotional as well as cognitive growth is affected. I recommend that anyone who gets a chance to read this book does so, especially parents and educators of young children.Agnes.",

                "review/text": "Enough denialDr. Elkind is a veteran of decades in child psychology. As such, he&#8217;s surely seen the harsh realities modern adults perpetrate on their kids: the explosions in divorce, drug abuse, criminal behavior, imprisonment, and instability among older grownups once thought immune to these problems. Consider these shocking changes: in 1970, a 40 year-old parent was only one-sixth as likely to be arrested for a felony as his/her 14 year-old teen; today, the teen is more likely to be visiting dad or mom in jail. No generation of teens has ever suffered the kind of hard-drug addiction, family chaos, and adult disarray that modern youth routinely face.Yet, Dr. Elkind has remained steadfastly oblivious. Adults are fine, he insists; just a bit overworked and too trusting. The big problem, he soothes, is that we tragically misjudged how &#8220;incompetent&#8221; children and teenagers are and &#8220;hurried&#8221; them into premature adulthood while neglecting the evil influences of pop culture, the media, and peers.Well, someone should call an end to this charade, which is not Dr. Elkind&#8217;s alone, but a general American delusion. I only wish the kids I worked with in their families for 15 years, and the statistics I studied upon returning to graduate school, confirmed that the problem is as simple as Dr. Elkind depicts. But it isn&#8217;t.First, the kids are fine; it&#8217;s the adults who have gotten worse. Teens (despite their bad publicity) have proven admirably competent in assuming responsibilities at younger ages, which modern family instability (not pop culture) forced on them. Dr. Elkind (quoting secondhand sources he apparently never checked) claims in his 1998 and 2001 books that teenage suicide and murder have tripled in 20 years, that &#8220;more than 5,000 teens adolescents take their own lives every year,&#8221; that &#8220;substance abuse has become epidemic,&#8221; rising numbers of children commit &#8220;adult crimes (theft, robbery, murder),&#8221; that U.S. teens suffer the highest pregnancy rates of any industrial nation, and that &#8220;children in contemporary America, including advantaged children, are less well off than they were a couple of decades ago.&#8221;All of these statements are demonstrably false except the teen pregnancy claim, and that was more true in the 1950s than today. In fact:- The latest FBI statistics have shown for several years that teenage felony, violence, murder, and other crime have fallen to their lowest levels in 25 to 30 years. In states that keep detailed records, it is clear that the temporary surge in teenage murder in the early 1990s affected only poorer youth, nearly all connected to gang conflict over supplying hard drugs to aging Baby-Boom addicts. Meanwhile, suburban and other &#8220;advantaged&#8221; youth are safer from violence and murder than at any time in decades.- Teenage murder is a factor of poverty, not culture (and not race). Black youth suffer murder rates 20 times higher than white youth, and poorer white youth (ie, in Oklahoma) have murder rates seven times higher than more affluent white youth (ie, in Minnesota).- Teenage property crime (burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, arson) levels are at their lowest level in 30 years, as are felony rates in general. - Particularly among younger kids (12 and younger), FBI statistics show murder arrests are at their lowest level in 1999 than at any time since data were first collected nearly 40 years ago.- Never, in nearly 100 years of U.S. mortality reports, have younger teenagers been safer from violent death than they are today.- The latest National Center for Health Statistics show 1,900 adolescents (under age 20) committed suicide in the most recent year, far below the &#8220;more than 5,000&#8221; Dr. Elkind quotes. Why on earth would he exaggerate teen suicide 250% and make it appear more normative?- Teen pregnancy rates are at their lowest level in 30 years (and birth rates at their lowest level since the 1940s). The U.S. rate is not due to teenage incompetence or pop culture, but poverty. U.S. teens who enjoy poverty rates as low as Western Europe&#8217;s (i.e., suburban teens) have birth and abortion rates as low as Europe&#8217;s; U.S. teens who suffer high rates of poverty have birth and abortion rates five to 20 times higher. How much longer are American authorities going to deny this?But false claims that today&#8217;s kids are uniquely messed up apparently are what modern adults want to hear. The unpalatable facts are that among adults ages 30-60 (the ones parenting teenagers) in the past 30 years, divorce rates doubled, drug abuse rose 400%, felony arrests doubled, imprisonments rose 300%, and an unquantifiable selfishness relegated childraising and children&#8217;s welfare far below adult needs. Anyone who doubts these trends is encouraged to consult your state crime, drug abuse, and prison agency reports.Instead of facing these troubling adult trends, a massive denial prevails, one insisting our kids and their &#8220;acting out&#8221; is what plagues the nation. In reality, we don&#8217;t know why kids got better as adults got worse, but surely that&#8217;s an intriguing question for psychologists and other experts to put aside their popular cliches and ponder. Dr. Elkind could do a tremendous favor by abandoning his specious claims that teenagers are incompetent and rushed into precocity by cultural influences. Youthsthemselves don&#8217;t have the luxury to evade adult-imposed poverty, domestic violence, and parental addiction and disarray, so why should we let Ph.D.s get away with denial?...",

                "review/text": "In The Hurried Child, Dr. Elkind does a competent job of describing a seriously problematic trend- the increasing inability and even unwillingness to appropriately \"cushion\" children from the modern world. The message is simple and eloquent: millions of children are simply not experiencing a proper childhood for a multitude of reasons. For some, it may be overcompetitive sports; for others, early sexuality or economic exploitation (children wielding more money and being strongly pursued as a consumer group). But regardless of form, hurrying leaves children trying to deal with adult concerns. While such kids may seem sophisticated, the deeper reality is that they are still children. This false maturation interferes with real maturation, and leads to problems in adolescence and adulthood.Dr. Elkind gives this book more popular appeal by making his case gently- there are no \"Dr. Laura\" type challenges here. But if the reader will think through the implications of this book, it is clear that children are being \"hurried\" because parents aren't making the kinds of choices necessary for a fulfilling and protective family life. Instead, they pursue personal, material and status-oriented goods, very often to the detriment of the family. This is not because they don't care for their kids, but because our culture is so steeped in radical individualism and materialism that the very idea of what a family is supposed to be is lost. It is no surprise that the children suffer as a result, in terms of both emotional and character development.I would propose a more profound solution than the \"moderation\" one to be found in this book. The cult of the individual needs to be overthrown. Parents should never make family-altering choices based solely on personal desires; the good of the children and the family unit as a whole should strongly influence what each member does. In addition, the excessive emphasis on \"achieving independence\" in childhood should be balanced with a recognition that all children need to be nurtured according to their stage of development. Children are not ready to be \"individuals\" in the adult sense of the term, which is why they are so easily influenced by peers, advertisers and celebrities. A strong, loving and non-hurrying family is a far more healthy source of influence than such factors. The more parents recognize and act upon these realities, the less kids will be \"hurried\", and the more they will be \"trained up in the way they should go.\"",

While some of his research has been the subject of criticism, \"The Hurried Child\" makes some vary valid points. With his insite, it is difficult to pin-point when childhood is carefree.In a society the is influenced by the whims of the business world, the working class is easily influenced. Business wants better works that produce at a higher, more profitable rate. Their solution is to put pressure of the educational system. This brings issues of accountability into school. Rather than teacher kids how to think, schools have to focus their curriculum around pass a standardized test to continue to receive funding. In some cases, the standardized tests start before first grade. This is just a sample of te pressure children have to perform. It is no wonder so many kids are seeing terapists who perscribe medicine to keep them from going crazy.Elkind presents various other forms of stressors on children and discusses why the stress is unnecessary. If something is not done to reverse the trend toward increased stress in our children, it will only get worse. One must realize that generations have turned out ok before the trends toward accountability. Without this movement, we are likely to continue to be ok.",

                "review/text": "I confess that I read this book because I already agreed with its conclusions and was looking for more rigorous support of what I have seen so extensively in an anecdotal manner. Case and point: this weekend, I overheard someone talk about how the school they attended as a child had the motto `College starts at two'. (This person and most of their friends got into elite universities. . . and then dropped out and spent several years figuring out what they wanted to do with their lives before returning to school.)So when Elkind writes, \"Hurrying children into adulthood violates the sanctity of life by giving one period priority over another. But if we really value human life, we will value each period equally give unto each stage of life what is appropriate to that stage.\" --- I can only agree with that.By the end of this book, however, I was reminded of the quote by Daniel Dennett: \"There's nothing I like less than bad arguments for a view that I hold dear.\" There are two major problems with this book.First, it's been inconsistently updated. Reagan's surgeon general is quoted in present tense and then there are references to Harry Potter. This really undermines the book, which is a broad category of nonfiction that could be called `alarming trends'. Like many of these books, this one grabs at anything recent that seems to support its main argument. But when time has passed since some spike in a statistic, it loses its ability to incite alarm. It does nothing for the book that it sees as evidence in its favor the spike in violence toward teachers in the late 1970s. I'm sure that the rate of violence toward teachers has gone up and down since then --- crime rates on the whole have dropped dramatically since then --- so tying the main argument to such things only diminishes the credibility. And it's not even clear where all this information is coming from, so a reference to a trend over `the last decade' leaves you wondering what decade Elkind had in mind.Actually, Elkind is just plain dated. His theoretical basis --- Freud, Piaget, Hans Selye --- were big in academia in the 1950s and 1960s. Only Piaget has really retained his standing. Selye seems more forgotten than rejected, though I think that most people, if they were informed of his views, would recognize that his conception of stress was very one-sided because it seems to imply that not moving at all is the key to a long happy life. And Freud has largely been reduced to a novelty over the last quarter century as it becomes increasingly clear that therapy based on his ideas has poor success rates and his cultural impact is seen in a more negative light (the way we now think of all touch as sexual, the moral panic over child abuse in the 1980s based on suddenly remembered memories, etc.).Second, Elkind is talking about sociological topics but thinks like a therapist. The logical way to structure this book is to talk about what children are capable of doing at particular ages and then compare that to what is expected of them and then explain the forces that push us toward demanding so much of children so early. Instead, this book feels like someone with a romanticized view of childhood clutching at their hair and moaning, \"Too soon! Too soon!\" The book is very anecdote based and seems driven more by a generalized anxiety about what's happening to children than levelheaded analysis. It also leads to some rather arbitrary conclusions, like disagreeing with a girl who thinks she's being hurried because she has four hours of homework each night and claiming that Brittney Spears is more developmentally appropriate for girls than Madonna.So when it comes time to explain why children are hurried, Elkind explains it in terms of Freudian family dynamics with only a vague awareness of how much of this has to do with economics --- the economics of corporations creating new markets and new desire on one hand and people's anxieties about falling behind economically on the other. Likewise, his `what to do' section starts off by saying that you can't change culture and suggesting semi-therapeutic responses.So honestly, I don't see much reason for reading this. It would have been great to read in the 1980s, but today it's not going to persuade the skeptical and it doesn't offer much advice to those trying to figure out what is the appropriate age for children to be doing things and how to combat unreasonable pressures. If someone can suggest a recent book that does do things like that, please drop me a line in the comment section.",

                "review/text": "I read this book a few months back and I'm still not decided on whether I 'loved' this book or not. I did like the book. It provided a lot of information I wasn't aware of, but I'm not sure I really liked the set-up of the book or some of the content. The main focus of this book is basically what hidden aspects of growing up stress a child out, and how that stress affects a childs development. He touches on some of the basic aspects like divorce, and death, but most of the book focus's on things that force a child to grow up too quickly. The main conclusion of every single argument in the book is anything that forces a child to grow up too quickly or puts pressure on a child beyond their natural capabilites is stressful for a child.The first half of the book is kind of a summary of the second half of the book, which almost makes the first half pointless. The whole time I was reading it I was getting a lot of interesting information/opinions with very little proof of the points he was making. But the authors points and the information he was providing was interesting. The best chapter of the first half of the book is the chapter on Lapware (computerized learning devices). He provided great arguments, and very valid proof to back up his claims. His information would be great to base future lapware studies on. I don't want to blow this chapter for you, but his basic point is that lapware doesn't teach a child anything that he/she doesn't already know.The second half of this book is extremely well organized, and perfect for parents, or anyone with basic knowledge of child-development. I study child development and I don't know that I've read a better book or text-book that puts Piagets development periods or Erikksons theories into better context than this book does. The way he was able to use those theories in connection with his own research, and other research was excellent. It almost makes me wish this book had a broader range of topic. I could apply the information in this book to pretty much every child I know. If you have a child that shows any self-confidence problems this book will be very helpful to you. There's nothing mentioned in the title or the description about self-confidence, but after reading the book it's easy to see how the demands put on your child affect their confidence.There is a lot of basic information on various topics from the basic biological reactions of stress, to how schools operate. He makes very compelling arguments against the idea of \"early is better\" in education. He also provides good evidence in favor of keeping the arts in schools by showing that activities like gym, music, and art help children relieve stress which helps them focus more on academics (in addition to their artistic values).At times I found some of the information in the book repetitive. He touches on certain subjects like divorce, drugs, and education numerous times. It's all good information, but I would have liked to have read more on media effects and social aspects with other peers than was offered.Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it provides a good balance between statistical data based research without being so dense it's not readable by an average parent. The writing style is very basic, and his research is based on stats just as much as his own experiences as a therapist. So he backs up any technical data with a personal example to explain it and back it up. It's somewhat of a perfect book for parents looking to understand more about their children, and people looking for an easy book to read with solid research.",

The illustrations in this book are startling and amazing. This would be a great book even if it didn't have any words, the pictures alone are great. This book was the winner of the Caladecott Medal for the Most Distinguished Picture Book of the year.This is a great story that both adults and children will enjoy alike. But I would recommend it for kids ages 6 and under. My son is always asking to read this book at bed time.",

I think that children can really identify with Max and his thoughts. When he is sent to his room for misbehavior, his imagination helps him to run away to where the wild things are and collect his thoughts. I believe that the author must remember what its like to be a child and feel like no one understands, and not quite understanding yourself. Ruling the wild things helps Max understand that he just wants to feel loved, and helps parents to keep in mind that such outbursts from children are generally cries for attention--for someone to love them best of all. Mr. Sendak understands children! When you read this book it will transport you back to your own childhood and you will remember that lost feeling of being a child. Bravo, Maurice! You are my hero!",

The tale focuses on an apparently rowdy youth, Max, who is sent to bed without supper for his rambunctious escapades in the house. Later that night Max dreams of a magical rowdy world where he is king of all things wild and terrible, but eventually Max comes to realize that having everything always go your way lacks any real fulfillment. The incorporation of some values into a beautifully illustrated adventure is sure to entertain any small child while still effectively presenting a subtle message. Thus, a child is not confused, nor presented with a meaningless tale. The pictures have been recognized worldwide and have been presented with the prestigious Caldicott Award for illustrations in children's books. This book is printed in hardcover, a bonus for when handling is to be done by children, and the font is large and separated from pictures to avoid confusion. The author's connection of the textual story to the pictoral story is helpful for children learning to read as well, as it helps to form associations between pictures and words. Widely recognized as a classic, Where the Wild Things Are is a necessity for any small child's library.",

First, you can tell it is dated because the boy is punished and sent to his room without dinner. This is not a current trend that the parenting experts advise. In our house we don't punish by withholding food, so my son was a little confused. My son also didn't understand what the boy did that was so bad that he had to stay in his room alone. In today's time of the time-out or the \"let's discuss your behavior\" method, this punishment seems outdated.Thanks to watching an episode of Scooby-Doo, my son is afraid of monsters and I've been telling him there is no such thing. So here comes this book and here are the monsters. Even though they are funny and good monsters, I was faced with telling my son these monsters were good but then trying to say that there is no such thing. I made up the storyline that he had fallen asleep and he dreamed of the monsters. The illustrations are fun for me to see and we talked about what the silly monsters were doing. I recommend that the parent read it alone first and think about how you want to present these issues to your children before siting down with them to read it to them. I wish I had done that!Update: The son I referenced above is now ten years old. He did go on to love this book when he was a bit older. My younger son also loves the story and always has. I guess this is a case of how each book affects different kids differently. As well it is an example of a book not clicking with a child at one age but the book is sometimes better for that child when they are a bit older.I have since seen this book referenced in book discussions, with adults analyzing the content to the minutae. I don't know if they are right or wrong or if it even matters.What I can report at this point in time in the year 2007 is that both of my kids love this book now and when they see the cover they say, \"Oh! That book!\" and they want to read it again. So perhaps this story also appeals to children in a way that we adults may not ever fully understand. And other adults may like the book for reasons that are different than the children's.Sendak is a favorite author and illustrator in our family. Chicken Soup with Rice is one that my kids are wild about.",

While we both enjoyed the brilliant illustrations and the storyline, I must admit that I -- also having been a calm, obedient child -- just didn't get it. Then I had my second child, a little girl who is a \"wild thing.\"Over-active children will probably relate to this story more. My little girl is intelligent, imaginative, rarely obedient and brings melodrama to the entire family, just like Max in the book. I began to see the book in a different light. It's the story of a boy who is lonely and angry, and the only way he can appropriately channel his anger is through imagination. The Wild Things are symbols of his wild emotions, which Max tames \"with the magic trick of staring into their yellow eyes without blinking once,\" and he's made king of all wild things. After rollicking wildly in the forest, Max conquers his anger and becomes lonely, only wanting to go back where \"someone loved him best of all.\"Children who experience these strong - albeit brief - emotions often have difficulty understanding them at first and learn to conquer them to \"re-enter\" the adult world where they must behave. If you have a child like this, you'll appreciate Sendak's ability to illustrate the imagination and feelings of a child who does not yet have the maturity to express emotions verbally.I can't wait for the movie release!",

Children are more distant from Mother and Father; they're more independant and rely on friends for companionship, or they have a tendency to spend time alone. Some nines are boisterous and wild, others thoughtful and withdrawn. Helping parents learn how to cope with the unpredictable nine-year-old is the aim of this practical guide from the Gesell Institute. Nine-year-olds are hovering on the brink of adolescence, and this in part contributes to their up-and-down nature. Dr. Louis Bates Ames and Carol Chase Haber paint a vivid picture of the child at this age and offer useful advice to make life easier for parents and children alike.",

While many children who talk late suffer from developmental disorders or autism, there is a certain well-defined group who are developmentally normal or even quite bright, yet who may go past their fourth birthday before beginning to talk. These children are often misdiagnosed as autistic or retarded, a mistake that is doubly hard on parents who must first worry about their apparently handicapped children and then must see them lumped into special classes and therapy groups where all the other children are clearly very different.Since he first became involved in this issue in the mid-1990s, Sowell has joined with Stephen Camarata of Vanderbilt University, who has conducted a much broader, more rigorous study of this phenomenon than the anecdotes reported in Late-Talking Children. Sowell can now identify a particular syndrome, a cluster of common symptoms and family characteristics, that differentiates these late-talking children from others; relate this syndrome to other syndromes; speculate about its causes; and describe how children with this syndrome are likely to develop.",

Sowell is a much needed pioneer on the research of bright late-talking children that share various characteristics such as: outstanding analytical abilities, and/or musical abilities, outstanding memories, strong wills, delayed toilet training, close relatives in analytical occupations (ex. engineers) and/or musical abilities, and other interesting characteristics that he describes in his book. Sowell writes about the frustrations a parent can go through with professionals misdiagnosing, to friends and family unthoughtful comments, to schools mislabeling for their own funding purposes. Sowell gives insightful examples of late-talking children and adults who talked late. He goes on to discuss the controversy on early intervention for this particular group of children. He does suggest that a child be evaluated by two separate independent professionals, to skip the &quot;free&quot; school district evaluation, and at the same time be an advocate for your child. Thomas Sowell encourages research and studies on the Einstein syndrome as well as more inovative and challenging educational approaches for these children.

After one psychologist accused me of being \"in denial\" I sought more information and found \"The Einstein Syndrome\".This book helped me understand the political and bureaucratic and academic machinations which are creating this bogus \"Autism Epidemic\" expecially in California. This book offered my wife and I real hope at a very dark time in our lives.I've waited almost 2 years to post this review. My son is now a playful, intelligent, affectionate, TALKATIVE 4 year old getting ready for kindergarten. All of the Autism/PDD \"symptoms\" completely disappeared on their own.

My son is currently getting straight A's and is enrolled in the school gifted program and is doing great in an accelerated math class.I'm very proud of him, he's the best son any father could hope for.The bureaucrats and educators in the school still occasionally harass him. They try to discipline him because they feel he looks or acts odd, not for any genuine reason. I have let the principal know that that I stand behind my son. I have come to feel that there's a real problem with misguided young (feminist) educators in our schools (especially in California). They don't seem to understand boyish behavior, especially behavior of the type that is characterized as autistic, and so they are try to label these children as diseased. There's money and careers to be made by these diagnoses, so it is sometimes difficult for parents to withstand the pressure of these \"experts\".Without this book I wonder I would have had the courage to stand up to those educators who pushed so strongly to have my son put ina class for mentally disabled students. Instead I stood my ground and insisted he stay in the normal classes, and he has thrived.Thanks again, Einstein Syndrome.",

But he needs to butt out of a field in which he has no expertise, especially when his conclusions are so profoundly irresponsible.Thomas Sowell's own child had language delays. It's as if he is protesting too much -- he wrote a whole book so the whole world would know his child was perfect, after all. Then there are a whole bunch of incomplete andecdotal reports of other bright children who talked late, and why. The reader has no additional information about these children's level of functioning in other domains. How do they socially? How do they function in school? How is their executive functioning? Are we sure they really talked late? Are their pediatrician's reports? He does not even define what he means by \"talking\"?For the purposes of his book, he should define talking in order to be able to demonstrate what it means when these children \"talk late.\" After all, \"mutism\" is an actual disorder. Is he saying they never uttered a sentence? Never gestured? Never pointed? Or did these children really go years and years without uttering a syllable? When did anyone notice that this was an issue, contemporaenously or in retrospect? It would be useful to view the comments and concerns of their pediatricians.Throughout the book, Sowell talks about Labelling, as if Labelling were an evil to be avoided. But what is so mystifying is that speech therapy is painless. Its effectiveness is well-established. Labelling will not keep the kid out of the CIA in 25 years. What is Sowell advocating? A child who can't tell you what he wants gets infuriated and frustrated, demoralized and unhappy. That's why the child should get speech therapy. And Sowell is selfish for gambling on his child's neurological future to -- let's face it -- save his pride.For babies, it matters less. They're tired, lonely, scared, hungry, wet, cold, hot or something hurts. Almost all of it can be remedied by feeding, changing, cuddling and soothing, unless it's a medical problem. In contrast, toddlers, they have more complicated needs. They don't want grape juice, they want milk. They don't want their noodles touching the sauce. They want the purple truck. It's his turn to play on the slide. The TV is too loud. He wants to watch Teletubbies, not Mr. Rogers. It is only fair that a toddler be able to engage in age-approriate verbal communication for that reason. There is no defensible reason to prevent a toddler with a communication problem from getting help in being able to communicate.I would also note that with very specifically-delimited exceptions, none of which seem to be encompassed by this book, there are very few happy loners. Some kids give up because their social skills are bad, but most people are social animals -- whether they enjoy the company of one or two trusted people or they are total social butterflies. A child should be taught social skills at an early age so that he can make the choice on his own terms, not because his social skills are so poor that society makes those choices for him. That renders a child miserable and powerless and, by the time he is in middle school, a target for bullying.And anyone who has witnessed children of any intellectual level who are frustrated because they can't get their basic needs met -- due to a lack of ability to communicate them -- would understand that this is a matter of compassion, not dogma.Meanwhile, the authors offer no justification of any kind for their position that these children should be denied help.",

The boundries of high functioning autism and eccentric personality are not well defined, particularly in the young child. I have come to believe it is much wiser to address speech delay and it's commonly associated behaviours aggressively. If all turns out well by the age of five, so much the better. If however your child does in fact lie somewhere on the autistic spectrum then you will have let him or her down by doing nothing at this early stage.Lastly, my personal experience of speech therapists and other professionals working with late talking children is quite contrary to what Mr Sowell writes. Most are seemingly inundated with work and often it is left to the parents to push for the services their kids are entitled to.",

                "review/text": "As one of the \"semi-professionals\" Sowell references (a Floor Time therapist working in a not-for-profit Los Angeles clinic), I found Sowell's book compelling and interesting (I read it in one sitting) but incomplete. Along with Sowell, I agree that a baffiling amount of bias and incomptence can be found in a variety of schools/programs/clinics designed to treat children with special needs. I myself felt inadequately trained/prepared by my clinic before being assigned to cases. However, unlike many of the other \"semi-professionals\", I have a desire to learn as much as possible about the study of speech delays (particularly Austism and PDD).Specifically, I picked up this book because of a 2-year-old client I am currently seeing who seems particularly bright but who has been identified as 'at-risk' for Autism on the FEAS scale. He currently recieves almost 20 hours a week of 'early intervention' services and both his parents and I worry that this much therapy may be innapropriate for a child of his age and functioning abilities. At the very least, Sowell's book reminded me of my own limitations as a diagnostician, the importance of positive, open, sympathetic interaction with parents, and the importance of embracing a client's individual differences while developing their intervention program.However, although Sowell presents a compelling case for the existence of a subset of 'late-talkers' whose development is possibly further compromised by intervention services, his book offers little practical advice for parents of such children other than telling them to seek evaluations from a variety of clinical and medical experts. He makes little if no reference to the importance of factoring a child's receptive language ability and a child's ability to signal a want/desire using complex gestures in determining the likelihood of future 'spontaneous' language abilities.Additionaly, Sowell makes several one-sentance disclaimers about not offering parents \"false-hope\". However, it seems likely that there are more parents of special needs children like the one on p. 145 who might interpret Sowell's theories as an endorsement of a 'wait-and-see' attitude.",

After I read this book I told my parents about it and much to my surprise my mother told me I did not speak myself in full sentences until I was about 3 years old. Conventional wisdom is not what this book is about which is why some readers do not come to terms with the reality of this subject. This book clearly states that majority of late talking children do NOT have the Einstein Syndrome and goes on to say that the child should be evaluated to determine the cause.The point of this book is to enlighten people about the fact that many of these late talking children are exceptionally bright who go on to become successful adults which is contrary to conventional wisdom that may indicate something is wrong with these children. The pattern explained in this book is key to understanding this phenomenon which is not explored enough or correctly by medical experts who sometimes are quick to label a child as having ADD or being autistic. The children examined in this book all have very unique characteristics and their parents and close relatives are in very particular fields. All the data that was collected in this book is identical to my family's situation. My father is a high level musical instructor and I am a senior analyst in computer technology field. My son is almost 2 and a half years old has only a handful of words and is yet to put a sentence together but he is extremely bright. He has some social anxiety with strangers. He is extremely strong willed and on occasions throws big tantrums. He also has some allergies. He is really good with puzzles and in fact puzzles are his favorite thing. He constantly figures out how to take apart the safety gates I install in the doorways which also something the author mentioned about his own son. He knows how to work the TV/DVD player and my laptop and many other things that point to the fact that his brain is developing differently and he is analytically advanced but is behind in speech. I point all these characteristics out which are the same with other unique children mentioned in this book. We do have a great speech therapist but went through two other ones who did not click with our son so finding the right speech therapist is extremely important. He is currently making good progress with his speech as he seems to pick up a new word in every session the speech therapist works with him. He also goes to pre-school 3 days a week and even though he is not able to communicate with his peers or teachers he is able to get his feeling and actions understood with his gestures/eye contacts and a few words that he says. It is clear to me that he will start talking when his brain is developed to handle speech as mentioned in this book regardless of all therapies. Of course Einstein was the extreme case of a late talking child who became one of the greatest minds this world has ever known but there are many other great minds who were late talkers as it will be the case with many future late talking children.I have no doubt in my mind that my son will grow up to be a successful and happy person as I am who also was a late talking child. I did have some social difficulties as a young man but now I have a very loving wife with two wonderful children and a great career. I did not receive any speech therapy when I was a child. Today's society and so called experts have created an unfair pressure on today's children to start talking at a certain age. Early intervention is not always the answer and not all children are the same.I also ended up in the engineering/analytical field as did many of the adults mentioned in this book who were late talking children. I am also another living proof of this syndrome and a testimony to this research and this great book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is open-minded and is willing to understand what this book is really talking about. One should also apply their common sense and intuitions when dealing with a late talking child as all children are different and so is their physical and mental development.",

The Murfreesboro Daily News Journal, Feb. 7, 2007). I Saw Esau is exactly the kind of book that begs a challenge. First it's illustrated by the wonderful Maurice Sendak, who seems to trail controversy wherever he goes. Second, the Opies actually collected the rhymes, sayings, and other nonesuch here from actual children, and of course, children must be protected from anything else said by their real-world contemporaries. After all, morons who challenge kids' books in schools either never were kids, have forgotten what being a kid was like, or are such humorless sticks-in-the-mud that they don't feel their own children deserve to have as fun a childhood as they did. (Any other interpretations of such boorish behavior-- and they are legion-- would verge on libel, and thus will not be speculated upon here.)If, on the other hand, you're a reasonable, thinking human being who has a shred of a sense of humor and are old enough to remember where you were when JFK was shot, and perhaps if you're a bit younger and hung around with people older than you were as a kid, you're going to recognize a lot of what's in here, probably with great fondness. You chanted this stuff, or variations on it, as a kid in the schoolyard. Maurice Sendak's illustrations complement the text wonderfully, often in frighteningly literal manner, and are never less than a pleasure. (But, oh, horrors, one must protect one's children from naked gluteus maximi that appear on a few pages! And oh, how terrible, one drawing features full frontal nudity! Well, tell me-- do YOU take a bath with your clothes on?) If you're younger than that, you'll probably be able to see the germs of your own schoolyard babblings in here, and be equally charmed. If you read it and are offended by it, then you may well be one of that subset of people who simply needs to be offended until you get it.

        "description": "Saving Childhood offers parents and grandparents practical strategies to cope with a society that seems perversely determined to frighten and corrupt its young. Cultural critic and popular radio host Michael Medved and his wife, psychologist Diane Medved, argue that in a mistaken effort to curb problems plaguing its youth, our culture has changed from protecting childhood as a precious time of growth to hammering even the smallest youngsters with a grim, harsh, and menacing view of the world. The Medveds systematically present unassailable scientific evidence, moving anecdotes, and personal experiences of raising their three young children to explain the attack from four primary directions--media, schools, peers, and even well-intentioned parents themselves. In a unique analysis the Medveds define innocence not as ignorance but as the result of three components--security, a sense of wonder and optimism. They empower parents and all who care about childhood with concrete, easily accomplished means to fend off the assault, as well as advice for handling hurdles such as the Internet, television, peer pressure, and the plague of pessimism. Saving Childhood enables us to restore and maintain for our children imagination, confidence, and hope for the future.",

The Media has so permeated our lives that it seems there is no way to protect \"childhood innocence.\"\"Saving Childhood\" offers parents hope and practical tips on how to encourage security, a sense of wonder and optimism in the life of a child. This book will empower parents and give them hope for the future.The first part of the book has been written to make parents aware of the realities of the situation and explains the \"Assault\" on innocence. The second part is the \"Defense.\" Michael and Diane explain that the Assault is coming from Media, Schools, Peers and Parents. They show how statistics have proved that the problems in our society are getting worse at a rapid pace and back this up with scientific evidence. They also explain many points with examples from the raising of their own three children.The Medveds explain how we live in a land where sex education has failed to reduce teenage pregnancy, children feel guilty for existing, parents push their children to grow up too fast, children have a lack of moral values, and parents have taken a passive role.So who is educating our children? It seems an inadequate school system and the TV!Television is well known for programs which contain high levels of violence. I have long been a believer that TV violence causes aggression. Michael and Diane prove this point and I found it interesting to read about how the crime rates increased soon after the introduction of TV into various towns.I grew up in South Africa for most of my childhood and remember very few people having TV's in the early years. TV was apparently banned until 1975. In fact, my father never purchased a TV and so I grew up basically TV-free! Perhaps that is why I can still enjoy a movie like \"Runaway Bride.\" Most of my friends are so jaded, they can't appreciate movies which I find to be very enjoyable. In fact, most movies are new to me.The Medveds also show how TV promotes impatience, self-pity, superficiality and gives us all a harsh view of the world. With all this negativity, how are we balancing our lives and promoting a positive view of the world?There are now three books I consider \"essential reading\" for every American: \"America's Real War,\" \"The American Paradox,\" and \"Saving Childhood.\" These three books are brilliantly conceived works which explain America's present predicament and give excellent solutions. After reading all three books, I am now convinced of our nations need for:1. Responsibility to a Higher Power. (90 percent of Americans believe in God) 2. Renewed respect for life and authority. 3. The teaching of personal responsibility, patriotism and honesty. 4. Parents that stay together and live what they teach. 5. The teaching of moral values. 6. The reading of inspiring books instead of a diet of negative TV reinforcement. 7. A revamp of our Education System. 8. Holding our Media responsible for programming. 9. Teaching a sense of gratitude for life. 10. An all-out effort to protect the remaining innocence of our children.In order to promote the efforts of parents, Michael and Diane devote chapter seven, eight and nine to explain how parents can promote \"security,\" \"a sense of wonder,\" and \"optimism\" in the lives of their children.\"Childhood is perhaps the only phase of life when innocence can flourish. But to allow this, parents and others responsible for children's minds need to construct a protective shelter against the painful and frightening facets of life. They need to stand guard at its door, to let the harsher truths of reality gradually unfold for the child, in a way and at a pace that allows the child to maintain a positive outlook. Honoring innocence is incompatible with assuming that the earlier children grasp all the worst aspects of the world, the better prepared they'll be to handle them.\" -- \"Saving Childhood\" page 195To this I add one of my favorite poems for children:May tree and plant and shrub be soundless through the night and stars and moon be dimmed to shut out all the light. So when you sleep in peace, no bird will move in flight, and angles guard your sleep. Goodnight, my love goodnight. ~James Neill Northe~The Rebecca Review",

Supplying solid statistics and reasonable examples, the authors make a convincing argument in the idea of eliminating one's TV altogether.But this book is not an attack on America's social system.

The Medveds are well intentioned, but they try so hard that it undermines some good points included in their analysis. To use a baseball analogy: they came up with the bases loaded; rather than simply trying to put runs on the board with a solid single, they loaded up for the grand slam, resulting in a pop to third base.The book is quite &quot;over the top&quot; in its included examples of our culture and the manner in which to counteract the at-times negative influence of the media, peers, school, and parents. As other reviewers have noted, some of the Medveds' examples of their reaction to certain situations are downright chilling. One example: their local librarian had (innocently) recommended a particular Judy Blume story to the Medveds' 7 year old daughter (a gifted reader); the Medveds were shocked to find that it included a discussion of menstruation. The parents' reaction was to take the book from the child, tell the child the topic was off-limits until they were older, and then to forbid the child from checking any book out of the library that was written since 1960. Geez! Why not pull the librarian aside and say that you would appreciate more age-appropriate recommendations, rather than a &quot;young adult&quot; level Judy Blume book? Why not have a simple talk with the daughter about menstruation? Would it really corrupt her &quot;innocent&quot; childhood that much?Although the tone can seem &quot;holier than thou&quot;, I believe the Medveds are well-intentioned. The problem is that the evidence cited tends to be the absolute &quot;worst case&quot; situations, and the proposed solutions are a bit extreme. (E.g., the Medveds don't own a TV; somewhat ironic given that the only reason anyone has heard of Mr. Medved is his TV work.) I think the book would be more useful if it were &quot;toned down&quot; and the essential message were allowed to come through - that in today's culture, with the sheer volume of messages rebounding that are not appropriate for children, it requires CONSTANT vigilance by parents, who must be willing to step up and exercise guidance and, yes, discipline to insure that their children are able to have a true &quot;childhood&quot;.",

Michael and Diane Medved set the reader's table with a bountiful array of fascinating - sometimes disturbing statistics and quotations surrounding the many influences on childhood. Like a fly buzzing around the stuffed turkey however, is the Medved's consistent opinionated and judgmental interjection.The book systematically addresses \"the assault on innocence\" by media, schools, peers, and parents with a barrage of statistics and quotes by specialists in related fields. Few are spared by the accusing Medved finger. Refreshingly, the targets of attack are not limited to one aspect of society, but rather proposes that the most ignorant entertainer is perhaps no more guilty of this assault than the permissive parent.Educators, parents, caregivers, and just about anyone interested in social analysis and criticism will find Saving Childhood an entertaining, worthwhile read. However, these very same readers may also find themselves eventually rolling their eyes over the repeated, cutesy tales of the authors' own family. For those of us with children that walk in dirty sneakers rather than fly on angelic wings, the Medved's personal life may evoke mild nausea. Similarly, those that indulge in occasional tasteless humor may become defensive when they find the Medved finger pointing directly at them.Nonetheless, the book's social and personal value far exceeds its minor quirks. The average adult reader will find the writing light and approachable, and will undoubtedly walk away with at the very least a new perspective on the subject; perhaps, the reader will even walk away a better person.",

Example: It's good to talk with your pre-adolescent about the changes her body will soon undergo, but that information is not appropriate, nor necessary, for younger children. Dovetailing this is the theme that popular culture is at odds with protecting the innocence of children. Example: Children should be encouraged to dream about becoming pilots when they grow up; they should not be encouraged to make actual cross-country flights at an age when they should still be believing in the Tooth Fairy.But I do have reservations: This book would be much more effective if it were more subtle. It is not necessary to throw in anecdotes about how their daughter was frightened to the point of hysterics by a news report of the Lorena Bobbitt case; or, at the other extreme, how their other daughter reported that a certain book was not appropriate for her to read. Showing that their own children are not isolated from the invasive childhood-destructive agenda of popular culture is important; it is admirable that their daughter is obedient, knows right from wrong, and feels secure enough to let them know when something she reads is upsetting. But, the dramatics with which the stories were told was unnecessary and could have been related through more discreet means.I also took exception to the Medveds' presumption to offer suggestions on how Christians should celebrate two of the most important and holy feasts of the Christian liturgical year. Their point about preserving the wonder of childhood fantasy is well-taken, but to suggest that Christians should preserve belief in Santa and the Easter Bunny (especially when the Medveds themselves are not likely to do so with their own children) and incorporate fantasy into two solemn (albeit also joyous) religious feasts borders on arrogance. Would not the Medveds bristle at Christian suggestions as to how they ought to observe Jewish holy days?All in all, SAVING CHILDHOOD is important and timely, but could have been improved with discretion and subtlety.",

His concerns are valid, but the logic in which he makes his arguements is flawed. Examples cited often use &quot;worst case&quot; anecedotes or studies and sometimes the detail behind his assertions makes no sense. In one instance, he complains about obsense lyrics in an album that I don't recall ever hearing about, then he states that children will be harmed by a discussion of the controversy. On the same page, he laments the youth of certain musicians such as the Hansons and a 16 year old blues artist. No complaints here about the content, just a concern that the artists are too young. (Doesn't he remember the Jackson 5 or Partridge Family?) Another section I found almost laughable was the story about his 8-year old saying &quot;This is a bad book&quot; about the Girl Scout Junior Handbook, because the child had come across a discussion of menstruation. Couldn't she have just skipped over it? How are they going to explain to this child when she is 12 that this is now a &quot;good&quot; topic? I would like to read a book by the daughters in about ten years as they describe their upbringing in retrospect. Especially the one that says she is picky about her friends and would never have a friend her parents didn't approve of. Talk about children who have been programmed to say the right thing! In summary, I did not disagree with many of the points mentioned. I would have liked to see more emphasis on the influence of media of females' body image and a more balanced look at sex education.",

Protecting these basic rights is the prescription the Medveds offer to counter the everyday assault by the media, schools, peers, and even parents themselves, that interfere with healthy development. This book offers solid, if somewhat idealistic advice for parents who feel they are parenting upstream. In this &quot;age of enllightenment&quot; today's children view wars on television, read about children killing other children, and develop dangerous eating disorders as young as the age of nine. It is difficult to argue with the Medved's assertion that children receive more information than they can process and still feel good about the world at large. I would recommend this book to any parent trying to shelter their children from the barrage of adult information aimed specifically at children. In our family, no day is ended without each of us thanking God for his blessings; an American flag flies in front of our house. Security, a sense of wonder, and optimism are worth fighting for for our children.",

By sharing her thoughtful, well-researched insights, Laura Sessions Stepp is able to help demystify what is often a difficult passage for both parents and teens.As the mother of three boys, 12, 15, and 17, I found this book enormously reassuring. By talking intimately with young teens and their families and friends, Ms. Stepp found that despite the pressures and challenges to succeed, fit in, and experiment with independence, teens still want what they've always wanted: to be loved and accepted while they discover who they are. As a corollary to this, Ms. Stepp assures parents that the role they play is still crucial even as it changes, that their relationship with their teens is all-important even as it transforms.We all know &quot;it takes a village,&quot; but often we're not sure exactly what that means. At the end of each part of her book, Ms. Stepp lists several things &quot;As Parents We Can...&quot; do to encourage our teens in their growth and development, and involve other positive role models in their lives. These tips are distilled from the chapters that precede them, chapters that illustrate WHY it's important to act on this guidance.&quot;Our Last Best Shot&quot; gracefully blends true-life stories with documented scientific research to give us a better understanding of all the influences at work in a teen's mind, from hormones to peer pressure. We get a detailed picture of the young teen that rivals all we know about infancy.The writing is clear, frank, and best of all, positive. We hear so much about the effects of divorce, teenage pregnancy, learning disabilities, overcrowded schools, alcohol and drugs, guns and violence, AIDS, and all the rest. It's refreshing to hear a sensible, rational voice that says, &quot;Stop. Wait. Most teens are great kids, and we can help them become even better.&quot;",

Now that they are 15 and 9, I can't find much worth reading to help me with their needs. I found that this book was very helpful. The author interviewed many teenagers and profiled 12 of them in this book. The book is an interesting glimpse into their lives, and the lives of their families, and the unique problems they each face. Although this is not a &quot;self-help&quot; book, with prescriptions for how to solve the problems parents face, the final chapter summarizes the author's findings from the interviews and gives advice to parents. This summary should be copied and posted where every parent of a teenager will see it frequently because it's a very complete summary of things that teenagers need from their parents.I am also starting to work my way through the books listed in the bibliography. It appears to be a great resource for further reading about adolescents.Finally, I wanted to explain the reason I awarded only 4 stars. I felt that the book focussed too much on teenagers who have some kind of &quot;problem&quot;: poverty, drugs, neglect, etc. Although the book was useful for all parents of older children and teens, I think it would have been better for me if there had been a few more middle-class kids who are doing well in school in the book. That's the kind of kids that I am dealing with, and they still have problems. I suspect that's the kind of kid a lot of... customers are raising too.",

In 12 profiles of young adolescents, the author touches on the turbulence but wonderful promise of young teens. She cuts through all the theoretical jargon with an amazingly graceful writing style. This is its finest strength---to communicate what experts in the field know about youth development in engaging storytelling profiles. This makes it a wonderful read for anyone, with children or without.Beautifully insightful, and at times poignant, the private look into the lives of these children gives you the freedom to draw many of your own conclusions. It is also extremely refreshing to see children from many backgrounds portrayed--Children of married families, divorced ones, white, city, rural, Hispanic and African American.

Durham, NC, and a small town in Kansas. We get deeply into the lives of these youngsters and their families. We share everything from their triumphs to their getting into very serious trouble (one was suspended from school for a year for bringing an unloaded gun to school). What we learn is that this age group is one in which kids start to assert some independence and both teachers and parents have to give up some control. Stepp puts it well .. we must let kids climb the mountain but still retain enough control to keep them away from the edge of the cliff. Kids this age must believe that we are listening to them and care about what they have to say. Kids need good role models including adults other than their parents. This age group is so crucial to a child's development. The need for more independence is so important yet the dangers of serious mistakes is ever present. What I like about this book is that Stepp makes her observations and offers insights and comments without inserting an excessive amount of ideology. Msny books of this genre have political agendas, both feminist and conservative, This book steers clear of such agendi. This book is important reading for both parents and teachers. I recommend it.",

An explanation is given of what temperament is, along with a discussion of the wide range of normal behaviors, some of which have traditionally been labeled as abnormal in the past but are actually just variations of normal. The book's most useful aspect as I see it is its guidelines for reducing the amount of stress and conflict between parent(s) and child(ren). A suggested plan is given for identifying the temperament profile of your child and how to spot the trouble areas, which depend not only on the child's innate temperament but how well that temperament &quot;fits&quot; with the parent's expectations for the child. To alleviate stress in problem areas (such as a naturally slow and careful child with active, fast-paced parents who are aggravated by the child's pace) Dr. Carey gives many specific suggestions and strategies for adapting to the child's style. This is one thing I really like about the book: there are many, many specific, concrete examples and suggestions of things to say and do, that a parent can use right away. Besides the notion that many behaviors considered &quot;problems&quot; by some parents and health care professionals are actually variations of normal behavior, another important point is that extremes of behavior that are problematic in a small child (such as dogged persistence leading to inflexibility) can be assets later in life (persistence is a good thing for most adults). This book can change lives for parents who are fed up with their children, or who find themselves at their wits' end dealing with them. It can immediately make life easier for all members of a family. Even for parents who don't feel quite so frazzled by their children, there is much important insight to be gained from Understanding Your Child's Temperament. I recommend it to all parents.",
