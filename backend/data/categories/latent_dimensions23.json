                "review/text": "I finished Prime this afternoon, and not three hours later I found myself re-reading it. The night that I began reading it, I dreamed about it all night. So, I suppose you could say that this book has endeared itself to my soul. Much better than Liquor (even though I loved that one too), I found the characters I already knew to be fleshed out even more, and the ones I didn't know were fascinating. Oscar and Woofer deserve stories of their own. Just a suggestion: possibly a story of Oscar's bid for D.A.? At any rate, my desire to learn more about these characters will expedite the process of reading some of the older stories they appear in.I've been hearing a lot of talk about the friendship that was struck up between G-man and Dirty King, and how it seemed like a weak plot point, and at first I was inclined to agree. After thinking about it, I changed my mind. I know first hand that when you treat someone special in a restaurant, especially when family is involved, strong bonds can be formed. Just as Rickey thought, extreme, yes, but not impossible. After all, a restaurant can be a great place to network.Given the fact that Chris is a restaurant veteran, and Poppy is a restaurant fan (for lack of a better term), I still find it amazing how dead on she is with the culture. Having worked in restaurants for thirteen years, I can truly say that she nails it every time. I would read books about these characters even if they were about the everyday nonsense. I would even venture to say that the scenes in the restaurant are some of my favorites.My only hope, and I admit that it is somewhat selfish, is that someday G-man will be the driving character in this saga. Rickey is great and I see why Liquor and Prime feature him as the main character, but a future story with a strong G-man influence would be awesome. G-man ponders that he may not be where he is without Rickey, but I submit that the reverse may also be true. Prime made me appreciate G-man so much and I can only think that a story with him in the driver's seat is in order. I found it very interesting that while Rickey battled with his attraction and ultimately would not even think of cheating in any way, G-man realized that whoring himself out a bit might help his partner. I know the situations were different, and G-man was never really in a real position to cheat, nor did he have any desire. The fact that he was dedicated enough to do something that he perceived as wrong, even for the greater good, warrants a G-man fueled tale. Not only that, his struggle with his faith surely deserves further investigation.Above all, I think that these characters can and surely will go on for some time. Mysteries aside, I can see many possible futures for these characters. Honestly, in my opinion, the mystery was the back story. I've found both Liquor and Prime to be well thought out, character driven stories. The back drop that is New Orleans and the restaurant world are far more interesting. Even though I'm dying for a G-man story, I could enjoy a tale about Liquor, the restaurant, as mundane as having to deal with a day that the produce forgot to be ordered. Then again, we know how that would play out. Rickey would freak, and G-man's cool composure would save the day. Unsung heroes keep the world turning. I may be the first member of the G-man fan club.All I know for sure is that all the Doubting Thomases about Poppy should get over it. We can all appreciate the past, but Prime seals the deal. Further discussion of old work vs. new work is no longer valid, and I, for one, couldn't be happier.",

(I know her husband has, but hey, my wife is a lawyer and I haven't written the great legal thriller yet.) It's amazing the little details she get right. When I heard there was a sequel to Liquor, I thought 'The restaurant's open. What else can she do - write about the daily specials?' She does write about the daily specials, but the plot twists and turns keep Prime just as exciting as Liquor. I'd love to cook for her someday!

I had never read any of Ms. Brite's work until a friend sent me a copy of Liquor last year, as a cheering-up present when I was down about MY kitchen job. I fell in love with her characters, her dead-on description of kitchen life, and the way that she made larger-than-life thriller elements seem plausible and natural. I've been eagerly awaiting Prime ever since.It doesn't disappoint. Rickey and G-man are as appealing as ever, and she manages to make me identify with both of them, despite their very different personalities. The dialogue was perfect; I could hear every word in the voices of my colleagues. I especially loved the bit where Rickey was trying to write the letter to Firestone about the consulting job; it's no mean feat for a writer as talented as Ms. Brite to capture the style of a man who isn't comfortable writing at all.I bought the book right before I started a dinner shift, and didn't start reading it until I was home at around midnight. I found myself staying up and reading it straight through until 4 or 5 AM. Not only couldn't I stop turning pages, but in some spots, I was laughing so hard that I was afraid I'd wake up my husband.If you're at all interested in the restaurant world, or even if you're not, but just like a well-plotted story with wonderful characters and elements of intrigue, give Prime a look. You won't regret it.",

What I did really enjoy about this book is Poppy's extensive knowledge and ability to paint a picture of the New Orleans without pretension and with an insider's eye. And of course, the delectable descriptions of food preparation (and mispreparation) would leave any foodie hungry. I really enjoyed the continuation of her loyalty in trying to let us all in on the secrets of what New Orleans is really like beyond the beads and booze. Plus the relationship with G-man and Rickey is really fantastic. It just seems like far too often gay is another character in a book (in addition to the actual physical characters). Their relationship is loving and genuine in an everyday way that is at the same time not everyday at all.All in all, a definite recommendation!",

                "review/text": "I've always felt that the best writers (or, at least, the most interesting ones to read) are those whose books seem less like books and more like warp zones to other universes, writers who create worlds that live and breathe and seem just as alive as this world we're so familiar with. Some writers are better at this then others: H.P. Lovecraft in particular had it down cold. I've always thought Poppy Z. Brite was good at this kind of world-building: First the whole Missing Miles mythos of \"Lost Souls\" & \"Drawing Blood\", and now the New Orleans-Ricky/G-Man saga, begun in \"The Value of X\" and now continued in Mrs. Brite's latest book, \"Prime\", a sequel to \"Liquor\". These books introduce a pantheon of people in everyday New Orleans, but there's still a lot off oddness going on here: As noted comic book writer Harvey Pekar so astutely observed, \"Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff!\" I can't quite say why I like these books so much, other then the fact that I appreciate the author's ouerve... I mean to say I've never even been to New Orleans and my idea of fine cusine is chicken flavor Rice-a-Roni. Yet still, the contents of these works never fails to fascinate me, but then again it's human nature to take an interest in topics one knows nothing about... Often times such things seem so exotic to us.I liked \"Liquor\" very much, but I'd have to say that \"Prime\" is a vast improvement. \"Liquor\" felt very stripped down and streamlined, and at certain places slightly awkward to me: Of course this was understandable as Brite was trying something new and thus trying to get comfortable (I feel the same way about \"Lost Souls\", which seems a little less assured then \"Drawing Blood\", probably my favorite Poppy Z. Brite book). One thing I always enjoyed about Mrs. Brite's books was the nearly poetic descriptions of even the most banal things, her eye for extracting the magic from the ordinary. I didn't get that feeling so much in \"Liquor\", but I got a lot of it in \"Prime\", which abounds with some really great descriptions (my favorite being the images we get at Saffron with it's industrial spider webs) and metaphors (my favorite also taking place at Saffron: \"They studied the menu with the absorption of Biblical scholars coming upon some previously unknown Gnostic text\"). I guess what I'm trying to say here is that where \"Liquor\" merely whistled, \"Prime\" sings: It's obvious from reading this book that the writer has a love for words (any writer who uses words like \"pusillanimous pustule\" clearly does) and it's good to see more of this in \"Prime\". I have no time for books that are mostly just dialogue (unless it's really good dialogue) and little description: Words are to writers what paint is to the artist, after all. \"Prime\" is also perhaps Brite's most tightly plotted book since \"Drawing Blood\", and maybe that's why it's only 283 pages: It seems less rambling then some of her other books, though I wouldn't have minded if it had been a little longer. Also I was glad to see there were barely any typos at all, which means that the editor or whoever was doing their job (nothing's more distracting then typos, but that's nit-picking).Regarding G-Man and Rickey: I still prefer Rickey of the two, though G-Man is starting to grow on me a little. Rickey still strikes me as the main character. Perhaps this is due to the fact that he was a more dominant personality, or maybe just because the plots of both books revolve around him: He's the one who sets up the restaurant in \"Liquor\", and in \"Prime\" he gets most of the page time. G-Man has a few individual scenes, but it still seems more like Rickey's story (then again, I felt that \"Value of X\" was G-Man's story, at least until Rickey went to the CIA). Though many writers put bits of themselves into their characters I imagine that Rickey is the one most like the author in this case.... Certainly Rickey's thoughts that \"He was happy to leave the written word behind\" is something that many writers have felt at one point in their life.As for the supporting cast: Lenny's back, and he's still a favorite of mine: Probably one of my favorite characters that Brite's written, actually (when I read books I sometimes mentally cast actors in parts... I imagine Lenny to look like a hybrid of Emeril and Saul Rubinek). The scene where Lenny and Ricky \"fight\" is probably the comic highlight of the book. Lenny is a little less prominent in this book then he was in \"Liquor\", but it's good he's still around. Oscar De La Cerda, a minor character in the first one, takes on a bigger role here, and he's got some good lines, like when he says he's the \"Bermuda Triangle of pens\" (I should say here that the dialogue is quite witty in this book). Woofer is an good addition and hopefully he'll do more in future novels (I always have a soft spot for hyper intellectuals who manage to sprinkle their conversations with words like \"ecdysiasts\"). Dirty King, the rap mogul, was another cool new character. The \"Liquor\" crew (Terrance, Tanker, and two new additions, Marquis and Shade... I like Marquis the best of `em) don't have as much to do. A few characters from \"Liquor\" make small guest spots: the humorous Sid Scwartz, and NuShawn, for example, and G-Man's parents make an appearance after being MIA in \"Liquor\" (I like Elmer... Mary Rose, not so much). Ricky's mom doesn't appear in this one, nor do a few other prominent \"Liquor\" characters, such as Anthony Bonvillano.As for the villains: Well, I feel that \"bad guys\" have never really been one of Mrs. Brite's strengths (of course, the line between \"good\" and \"bad\" in her books has always been a little fuzzy as it is). It just seems that the protagonists are inevitably more interesting, and with the exception of maybe Christian in \"Lost Souls\" and the serial killers in \"Exquisite Corpse\", her villains have never been very vivid (unless you're one of those old schoolers who think that Zillah is a good example of a well-fleshed out antagonist). \"Liquor\" suffered this same problem: Mike Mouton practically could have been wearing a t-shirt with the words \"I'm the bad guy\" on it, and everything about his character screamed \"antagonist\": His unattractiveness, his temper, his drug habit, and so on. He was there to add a bit of excitement to the story but he seemed more like a device then a character: He was very sketchy and didn't feel fully-formed (I wonder is Mrs. Brite feels the same way: Woofer's thoughts on the book \"Dark Kitchen\", for example, in which the writer of that book makes Rickey sound like a super hero while Mouton is just a \"word sketch\"). Fortunately, the foes in \"Prime\" are a little more solid. Frank Firestone is the mysterious Texas businessman with many secrets, Placide Treat is funny (and ultimately sad) as the flamboyant DA, but the real standout is the return of Coop Stark from \"The Value of X\". He was one of the more interesting characters in that book and I was glad to see him back (it also appears that he lost most of the creepy pedophile tendencies he seemed to harbor in that one). Coop is a very flawed character, and perhaps the most tragic of Brite's antagonists. At least Rickey feels some emotion towards him, unlike Mouton, who he just despised (also, Coop has a back story, so he seems a bit more flesh and blood). This adds a lot of drama to the story.The only real minus I could find was, once again like in \"Liquor\" there is a dearth of interesting female characters. This doesn't necessarily make a book bad (let's face it, William S. Burroughs' literary output pretty much focused on just the male gender), but it is discouraging to see such a small female presence in a large cast that is otherwise young and old, black and white, straight and gay. This time we get Tanker's girlfriend Mo (who doesn't even get a line of dialogue), G-Man's mother Mary Rose, Terabitha Evans (who only has 2 pages of screen time), Dirty King's mother, Sugar, Teresa Trepagnier, and a variety of nameless hostesses, waitresses, and what not, but most of the above are just bit players and none of them really stand out, except for Sugar and the lesbian cop Linda Getty, one of the more interesting bit characters from \"Crow: The Lazarus Heart\" (too bad she only gets a small appearance here). Even Dr. Brite doesn't show up (yeah, I know, the gender of Dr. Brite isn't a given, but Dr. Brite's described as a woman by both Ricky, G-Man and the Narrator in \"Liquor\", so in my mind, she's a woman). Let's just say I don't think Eddy from \"Drawing Blood\" has to worry about being dethroned as Brite's most interesting female character anytime soon. But this is just a minor complaint.I really need to check out \"The Confederacy of Dunces\" one day. Usually when an artist/musician/writer name checks another work as inspiration I go out of my way to investigate that inspiration, but I haven't got around to reading that particular one yet.",

                "review/text": "Poppy Z. Brite, Prime (Three Rivers Press, 2005)There's something thoroughly satisfying about reviewing Prime during lunch on a day when I'm sitting down to, well, not a gourmet meal, but about the best I can do given my current equipment and financial status. Hey, its got grilled fennel bulb as a side dish. I love fennel. It's subtle, sweet, tasty, and when you eat it for dinner, you wake up the next morning still having a slight taste of sambuca on your breath. In other words, it's rather like Poppy Z. Brite's new novel.Well, okay. \"Subtle\" may be pushing it a bit far. But this is Brite, a woman whose idea of \"subtle\" has, at times in the past, run to kicking the reader in the face with a boot that doesn't have a steel toe. I have acquaintances who are still traumatized after reading certain passages in Exquisite Corpse ten years ago. I get the feeling I'm going to have a difficult time getting them to read Prime, but I'm still going to try.Prime, Brite's third novel following the exploits of Rickey and G-Man (after The Value of X and Liquor), opens with Liquor doing good business, but its financial backer, Lenny Duvetaux, being investigated by New Orleans' notoriously crooked DA. Rickey wants to by Duvetaux out in order to keep the restaurant's name as clean as possible. This might well be helped by the offer of ten grand Rickey's just gotten for doing some consulting work at a restaurant in Dallas. There is, however, a fly in the ointment; the head chef at the place has something of a spotty past with Rickey. Complications, etc.First, kudos to Brite for not jumping on the current \"include recipes in your fiction\" bandwagon. That said, this may be the first book I've read where I really want the recipes. Does that foie gras cr&egrave;me brulee really exist? How do I make it? (And this coming from someone who doesn't even like foie gras.) It sounds divine. And you're certainly not going to get a veal cheek recipe from the latest Tamar Myers mystery, buddy.As you may have surmised, Prime is a novel for (though I hesitate to use the term) foodies. I can pretty much guarantee that the more orgasmic you get over the thought finding a black market supplier for wheels of real, unpasteurized Danish havarti or traditional haggis, the more you are going to revel in the joy that is this novel. (If your idea of a gourmet meal is White Castle, you are likely to find yourself hopelessly lost.) Yeah, okay, there's a good deal of dramatic tension in all the right places. And there's even a mystery to be solved, though it really doesn't get geared up until well into the second half of the novel. That the reader is unlikely to care is a testament both to the power of good writing about food and the considerable aplomb with which Brite can wield a pen. There's action when necessary. But all the way through this book, I kept thinking to myself that it could all have been absent, and I'd still have loved it. Just a book on the day-to-day lives of chefs working at a restaurant, coming from this particular pen, would have been just fine with me. Part of that is, well, I love a good veal cheek as much as the next guy. Part of it is that Brite is good enough at pacing that she can make a description of what someone at an expediting station does just as readable (and even more memorable) than a description of the aftermath of a suicide. The rest of it stems from the fact that the characters are well-drawn enough that you don't have to have followed them throughout the series to get to know and care about them (as evidenced by the still-strong sales of Liquor, despite the relative obscurity of The Value of X). You toss it all in a tortilla, roll it up, and you have one hell of a novel. If you're lucky, and ask nicely, you might even be able to get it with a tomato salad and a side of Courvoisier-glazed stewed apples. ****",

The resturant, called Liqour, opened to rave critical review after a series of roadblocks and frustruations in the first book of the same name. Prime picks up two years after Liquor - the book - ends. The two chefs, Rickey and G-man, have enjoyed two years of success and are slowly finding themselves immersed in a new series of adventures - both hopeful and disconcerting.Prime, like Liqour, is an Epicurians wet dream. For those who love to indulge in the sensory delights of wonderful food, the numerous descriptions of meals made and eaten throughout the book will whet the appitite and cause the stomach to sit up and beg. One wonderful thing about this book is the Poppy Z. Brite does not underestimate the readers sense of smell, or their sense of taste. Granted - my experience reading liturature that revolves so heavily around eating, the life of resturaunteurs, and \"Foodies\" is limited to these two books, but I would like to assume that another author would be hard-pressed to come as close to setting such splendid meals in front of us with words, as Brite does. I have been reading Mrs. Brite's work for twelve years now, and that is the very reason that I have been a faithful reader since day one: regardless of what emotion, idea, or sensation she is trying to get across, she has the knack of writing it in the most intoxicating, convincing way.But Prime's true strength, as far as I am concerned, is the characters, and the characters in this series have more depth to them than any she has created before. It was such a pleasure to come into Ricky and G-man's world once more, as well as Lenny Deuveteax's - (one of my all time favorite characters from any series - Lenny's personality is multi-layered and, - despite his sneakiness, tough exterior, and distrust of almost everyone around him - he is great fun and easy to love.)I was also tickled to see Linda Getty - a charchter from Brite's Crow: The Lazerus Heart, make a cameo. Prime is wonderful because the characters and their personalities are so visceral, their reactions so utterly human, that the reader needs expend no effort at all immersing themselves in their world.I highly reccomend this book, as well as Liqour. If you are a fan of Poppy's earlier novels (Lost Souls, Drawing Blood, and Exquisite Corpse), rush to pick these up, for she has evolved her voice into something much better. With this series of books, we get to see Poppy finally comming into her own.",

But when his wife convinces him to buy two cell phones which can send pictures, this sets in motion a series of events which have Matt wondering who Olivia really is and why is his life spiraling downwards. on one otherwise ordinary day Matt's phone rings andthe sights he sees will once again change life as he knew it.And we as readers now embark alogn with Matt on a whirwind and well thought out plot stretching from New Jerey to Nevadawith a cast of characters we come to know and enjoy.This was a real good read, much better than Coben's last two books, No Second Chance and Just One Look, in my opinion. The characters are fully developed and we are privy to not only what is happening now but what happened to them in the past as well. Readers are able to feel all of the emotions as this story takes off and doesn't let go. One slight change from Mr. Coben's other stand alone books and main characters is that, Matt Hunter isn't quite as sarcastic as other characters found in this author's other books, ie Myron Bolitar This fact makes Matt a much more believable and vulnearble character. And as hardened as Matt may seem from priosn life,underneath we know that he can't believe the world he has made with Olivia is unraveling before his eyes.Harlan Coben's books at best are rather convoluted whichhas been one criticism which I have often heard about his books. I even found myself taking a few notes while reading his books to try and keep one step ahead of these well crafted novels. Overall, though, I found this book a bit easier to keep up with and if I didn't get all of the goings on at the end, Matt Hunter himself says there are some things he won't ever understand either. And this I can live with since I really enjoyed this book. If I had one small criticsm it would be that the end was a bit too coincidental as if the author decided to tie up the book with an ending which readers were hoping would happen.While I have read all of Mr. Coben's stand alone books I haven't read any of his Myron Bolita series books. I hope to read them this summer. And I also am anxiously waiting for Mr. Coben's next stand alone. he can't write them fast enough for me and I highly recommend his books.",

                "review/text": "McEwan creates well the atmosphere of a post-war, pre-wall Berlin, amplifying our imaginings. The interaction between Brits and Americans is full of subtle humor, and as it later turns out, great regard and humane understanding. The narrative is smooth and concerns an everyman, virgin, British geek assigned to an American intelligence project consisting of building a tunnel crossing the border into the Russian zone to tap underground phone cables through which presumably important matters are discussed (remember, we are in 1948, almost a decade before Sputnik). Love interest and sexual education is provided by an experienced German girl to our Brit, the virgin geek. The writing is so smooth that one doesn't realize one is turning pages and reading on at a rate as if one were reading a chock-full-of-events thriller when in fact not much is really happening; the tunnel is just chugging along. But McEwan is a \"smooth operator\" and he is moving you along, hinting at tension, to the point you are expectant of actions or revelations in the intelligence component of the novel to pop-up any minute and throw everything topsy-turvy.Rest assured McEwan is too smart to do that. Nothing happens as such that you are aware of for three quarters of the book until our everyman, the somewhat endearing British geek is plunged into a grand guignol not of his making and totally alien to the place where you would have expected the excitement you were owed to come from.(After all, you bought the book and it was sold to you as a thriller, and after all, it takes place in thriller-city and all major protagonists except two are freeks and geeks and goons and guards mostly in uniform and with varying levels of security clearance in the intelligence services of the powers which split this city. At times it looks as if each agent has his little black book which lists the interests they are called uypon to protect, investigate, eliminate, whatever, and thus move quickly about, talk with other similar blokes and keep moving about. The Tunnel provides a country-club of sorts for those connected with the project. There are body parts indeed, but they do not come from there.So, much activity occurs in our atmospheric tunnel, yes. But nothing happens there really. The unwelcomed death occurs elsewhere, has nothing to do with Military Intelligence. The neatly wrapped body parts do not bring the Tunnel down, it's the disguise they wear. But the story does not end there.Many years later a mature, no longer virginal Brit geek comes back to Berlin, post wall, to revisit sites, and carries with him a letter explaining what precipitated events at the tunnel and freed him of any trace of guilt, if any such he held.The explication at the end of the book is clear, surprising, and truly closes the nattarive in an intelligent, satisfying way.Endearing Love, after such an unforgettable opening and the obsessive development remains my favourite McEwan novel so far. Saturday is contrived, feels Thatcherite and stacked against the lower orders. Nonetheless I appreciated the medical tracts. (It's up for a Booker). In short, I liked \"The Innocent\" Better.",

I've proceeded to gobble up every stand-alone since Tell, but by the time I finished No Second Chance, his third stand-alone, I noticed Coben had employed THE VERY SAME TWIST IN EACH BOOK. Tell No One, Gone For Good, No Second Chance, Just One Look--the big mystery behind each pivoted on the same identical fulcrum. I wondered: \"Will he ever try something new?\"Enter The Innocent. I prayed and begged the gods of genre fiction that Coben had learned to flex his creative muscles. I bequeathed them burnt offerings as an intercession on Coben's behalf, that they would let the scales fall from his eyes and grow him to be more than a one-trick pony. Please, I wailed, please let The Innocent be different! No more of the same!But the gods must hate me.The Innocent has at its core the same schtick peddled in previous Coben stories which, for the sake of not spoiling your own reading, will not be mentioned in this review. The story had the twists and turns Coben's fans have come to expect, but in the end it seems he's grown quite content to re-gift the same gimmick to us time and again. Not only that, but The Innocent was his second most sloppily-written work behind Just One Look. His description resorts yet again to little more than telling as opposed to showing. The characters are better drawn here than in Look, the ever-present info-dump still frustrates--albeit not as madly as in Look--and the dialogue continues to be embellished and redundant. Furthermore, instances exist when the story FEELS like it's moving forward, but ends up staying in one place till the next chapter or the one after that. Comparatively speaking, Innocent was a welcome semi-return to form after Just One Look (a putrid piece of fiction). It doesn't stand up to Tell, Gone, or even Chance, or even most of the Bolitar series, but thank the fiction gods that at least we don't have to put up with Just One Look II: The Sideways Glance.The message seems to be, \"I'm Harlan Coben, I can take you for a ride, so I can grow lax in the areas not concerned with plot.\" He's since returned to his Bolitar series, and for that we can only hope his schtick has at last come to an end. Read this after Tell, Gone, and Chance (in that order), and skip Look. Be prepared, however, that the more you read his stand-alones the more you'll get the same ol' again and again.",

But as I kept working my way through the pages, the laconic prose kept putting me off. Don't get me wrong, the pages in this book flow like a molasses dream. But the story builds so slowly that it becomes frustrating. The main character is not very intelligent, and as a reader you will be jumping ahead of him, screaming at him like he was the blond bimbo in a horror flick to run out of the house. So as the story builds at its slooooow pace, and the `unsophisticated postal technician' Leonard Marnham frustratingly gets batted about like a moth in a box, we are left not as entranced readers, but as frustrated onlookers. That is my main beef with this story. I could not enjoy myself spending time with this character or the circumstances. McEwan did a remarkable job in writing this and pacing the story, he just never gave us a character that we as readers could relate to.I have never read McEwan before, and I am looking forwards to trying my hand at another of his novels. It was courageous on his part to create such a novel as this, and I respect him greatly for doing so. But I just don't think that this book worked very well.",

It's part psychological horror, part espionage, part mystery, part coming-of-age, part character study - and it's splendid.Set in 1954 in Berlin, before The Wall was built, it's the `true' story of the construction of a secret spy tunnel so the Brits and the Americans could spy on the Russians, whom they no longer trusted. Much to his surprise, Leonard Marnham, an extraordinarily innocent and nave British postal technician, is recruited to participate in this top-secret operation. A virgin at age 25, Leonard falls in love with a pretty German divorcee, and his initiation into the pleasures of a sexual relationship follows. The couples becomes engaged, but their world collapses into macabre horror on the night of their engagement party. The 80-plus pages that follow this horrific event are gruesome and spell-binding at the same time in a way that only a superb writer could possibly handle.The ending, leap ahead 30 years to 1986, feels a bit contrived and distanced, esp after the intense and personal material that's just been revealed.At its best, it rivals Pulp Fiction and Fargo for explicit shock value. At its worst...well, it doesn't have a `worst.' It's really, really good.But: Ian McEwan???? Who knew?",

Troubleshooter Lindsey Fontaine is nursing a huge crush on vertically challenged SEAL Mark Jenkins (hey - I'm not the one who made his stature abundantly clear 25 times in the book). When she is chosen as the \"victim\" she has to work double time to prove her SEAL-worthiness. Mark is attracted to Lindsey, but has always wanted childhood goddess Tracy Shapiro. He thinks he might have a chance with her now that Tracy has broken up with her wandering eyed boyfriend Lyle. Again. But after the competition, it is Lindsey who lands in his bed, then races out of it when Tracy has another meltdown and turns to Mark for comfort.When the competition proves successful, they decide to do it all over again... in the freezing cold mountains of New Hampshire. Tracy gets to come along as the victim, and Lindsey relishes in letting her know she can only bring one carry on. As they set out on the new excursion, the tension between Mark (who is now head over heels for Lindsey) and Lindsey is so thick you can cut it with a knife. But ever the professionals, they try to keep their feelings in check. During the exercise, chaos ensues, and then suddenly, Tracy is nowhere to be found, and falls unwittingly into the hands of a sadistic serial killer. Will the cowboys and troubleshooters find her in time?There is so much going on in this story. And yet, it really lags. There are three potential romances, two of which are triangles. And a serial killer on the loose... each could be a story itself. While Izzy can be humorous at times, it got old really quick. I found that the only compelling romance was between Sophia and Deck, and that one is destined to play out longer than Sam and Alyssa.Was it just me, or did Marc and Lindsey's romance sound eerily familiar, like perhaps Wes and Brittany from \"Night Watch?\" Vertically challenged guy in love with a woman they cannot have so they have a \"casual\" relationship with the next best thing that really turns out to be the best thing... It was a good read, but not one that would stand up to repeated scrutiny or readings. If this is your first SEAL 16 novel, go back and read an earlier one like \"Over the Edge\" first.",

Gorgeous, brave, clever and heart poundingly romantic, he is my ideal! I can re-read their story over and over again.Another reason this is my new all time favorite Suzanne Brockmann book is the tremendous sub-plot. Brockmann's Troubleshooter series is famous for it's sub-plots and Into the Storm has by far the best sub-plot yet! The sub-plot is EXACTLY what I want in a romantic suspense. Plot twists and turns, action, hot sex and delicious romance, Into the Storm is Ms. Brockmann's best work yet!AnnmarieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",

There are some great comic moments with Izzy Zanella, another Navy Seal who I can't wait to read more about. The subplot with the psychopath who captures the women and forces them to participate in his own private cock (Hen?) fight is truly depraved and fascinating in a train wreck kind of way.I love that Suzanne Brockmann takes people down to a fundamental level that transcends, gender, skin color, sexual orientation or any other grouping and shows the reader the compassionate side of human nature.Suzanne Brockmann can't write fast enough to satisfy this fan!",

Lindsey and Mark have great dialogue, a ton of chemistry, and some believable conflict. They aren't a tortured couple, but they do have depth, and Lindsey, without a doubt, is one of the strongest female leads of the series. I liked her, I liked Mark, and I liked watching them fall in love.The supporting stories are riveting, although I suspect most readers will find it hard to warm up to Tracy. Izzy, though, has a fresh and funny voice, and there are two scenes in particular that made me laugh out loud (something I rarely do while reading). Dave is a good guy as well, although I'm rooting for Sophia and Decker to finally get together.I also think Brockmann should be praised for being one of the very few authors in an overcrowded \"romantic suspense\" market who is able to seamlessly blend romance that is truly romantic, and suspense that is actually suspenseful.That said, there were a few things in this novel I enjoyed less than others. The serial killer plot, although original in terms of the plots of the other books in the series, is very hard to get through. Yet again, it's nice to see an author keep the focus on one group of people-- Navy SEALs in this case-- and yet branch out to include differing scenarios to amp up the drama.My one other complaint is that I think it's time for Sophia and Decker to have their own book. They've reached that same point as Sam and Alyssa did in \"Into the Night\" where the misunderstandings and the angst are starting to grate. Having their story evolve into a kind of triangle is a twist, but one that quickly out-stayed its welcome, in my opinion.But I can't wait for the next book in the series.

The story didn't flow as smoothly and logically as her earlier works did. Tracy's problem with alcohol isn't even introduced until more than halfway through. Even then, it is given little significance--but in reality, an alcoholic's behavior is governed by this addiction, either managing it or giving in to it.I will still read her books, but I won't buy them before reading the local library's copy first.

(There's already too much plot leaked on the back cover.) I liked Into the Storm tremendously on the first read through. For comparison, while I would rate most of SB's work as 4 or 5 stars, often it gets there on the 2nd or 3rd read when I pick up the details I missed the first time.ITS is a solid story, in and of itself, and it ends satisfactorily without everything being tied in a too-neat bow at the end yet doesn't read like a prequel. Note that there's a reference to WWII actions, but no distinct sub-plot from that time period that I know some are tempted to skip.It opens well - The opening action sequence sucked me in from the start. The interplay between Jenk and Lindsey jumped off the page in their very first scene.There's a lot of buddy interaction - you see the main characters with their friends. If you like that buddy interaction, you will almost certainly like that aspect of ITS. There are characters that we know and love in it, there are characters that we knew existed and are now more fleshed out. It's like old home week for long time readers, but would probably still work well for a new reader because we don't know these guys (male and female guys :) all that well, until now.There are multiple points of view, and all the characters are very distinct - but be warned in this case one point of view character is creepy. (If you get wigged out by scary movies, you may not want to read these scenes late into the night. Kind of like Gina in OTE was how we saw the hostages, Suz puts another character in so we see what's up with the serial killer. Yikes!) Jenk comes off as surprisingly normal and nice, and Izzy is a total riot who speaks in slang and idiom that had me laughing out loud through most of the book. I'm a language nut, so the changes in voice, insults, and idioms all hit my happy button. There are characters who are really good at what they do (also hits a happy button as we also see them being good at what they do)...and a character who is not, yet they are all integral to the story. There are some really strong female characters in this book, yet they seem like normal people too.I could picture people I know getting into some of the situations these people found themselves in, particularly when it came to the romance. I can picture someone looking around thinking, \"hrm, there are 7 people here to do a job that takes 2... when's the next time I'll get time alone with this hot babe? I need to make my move now before we really start working and won't have time.\" I can picture people just wanting to get busy and not start up a solid relationship - not classic romance novel ideals, I know, but the realism works for me.My biggest quibble with the book is actually with the publisher's blurb on the back. I think they gave away a spoiler - Tracy doesn't go missing until after page 250, so if you're just skimming along until you get to that plot point, you'll miss most of the book. I would like to request that in a 350ish paged book, that only plot points up to page 150 can be included on the cover flap.To sum up: This is a very enjoyable read - very fun, mixed in with some creepy. There is action, there is adventure, there is death, there is romance, there is friendship, and I liked it. I hope you will too.",

I don't understand why book publishers do this. It just makes the author look bad by giving the impression that they are taking f.o.r.e.v.e.r. to get to the \"point\". And it can utterly destroy any suspense the author might have been trying to build. I purposely didn't read the jacket sleeve before finishing the book because it detracts from the my enjoyment of the story so much.I enjoyed this book, in spite of the gross-out serial killer storyline, but I won't be re-reading it as I have with many of Suzanne Brockmann's other novels. Hopefully her next novel will turn its focus back to the more military/wartime storylines she does so well.",

This was very disappointing, I mean with all of the potential suspenseful (and ripped from the headline) realistic situations a group like the Troubleshooters and the SEAL team could be involved in she has them tangle with a hackneyed serial killer?! The over usage of serial killers in mysteries and thrillers is a pet peeve of mine, but this seemed particularly gratuitous and suspense-free. Also the Jenks character seemed half drawn and it felt by the end of the book I knew the other characters like Izzy, Sophia and even Tracy and his mother better than him. Early on there was some mention of his unique skill to \"make things happen\" which then completely evaporated as all the secondary stories took up more space. Lindsey was an interesting female character, strong and comfortable in her skin, but after a lot of build up about her relationship with her father, it turns out to be based on an overheard comment relating to her grandfather and is wrapped up too fast at the end with a weirdly dropped in mention of her mother's side of the family? Suzanne, please take even more time on the next one and focus on the story at hand, rather than trying to set up the next 3-4 books. And no more serial killers. Please.",

The tension between Sophia and Decker comes to a head, and Dave emerges as a solid, quiet hero.Without spoilers, it's hard to talk about the female characters. Suffice it to say that Tracy, like Mary Ann in previous books, redeems herself, and Lindsay is a true action heroine. Even Sophia has an active role in the final rescue.Warning to the squeamish: the villain does sick things. Suz treads a fine line between tension and ick. But the good news is that if you can make if through the first few chapters, you'll find that the tension increases but the ick factor does not. So hang in there, it's worth it! :)",

This book is about the stuff we've learned since selling those first few smoothies. About having ideas and making drinks, about running a business and getting started, about nature and fruit, about company life and working with friends, about the stuff we've got right and the stuff we got wrong, and about squirrels . . . and camping . . . and doing the right thing. We thought we'd write it all down in a book so we don't forget any of it, and to maybe help other people too. We started innocent from scratch, so we've learnt a lot of things by getting stuff wrong. Some other lessons have come from listening carefully to people clever than us. And some stuff we just got lucky on. But all of it, the good the bad and the useful, is in here. Plus, perhaps our mums will finally believe us when we tell them we haven't rung home for a while because we've been a bit busy these past few years.",

In \"The Innocent\" Coben weaves a very complex plot, populates with believable characters and, at the end, leaves you disappointed that the book has drawn to a close. You want more. More of Matt Hunter, who accidentally killed someone in a college brawl. More of Loren Muse, the intelligent, conflicted investigator who thinks Hunter is involved with current murders. More of Olivia Hunter, Matt's pregnant wife who wants nothing more than an ordinary life. And more of all the characters Coben creates.He is that good.The story is not simple. Coben's plotting reminds me of a gnarly tree: it starts at the bottom with a trunk and than branches off with some of the branches intertwining with others. Stories and characters overlap, but not to point of confusion.Coben is a master. In \"The Innocent,\" he has written a superb mystery thriller. Ordinary people thrown into extraordinary circumstances and doing what they must to survive --- if the bad folks don't kill them first.Superb.Jerry",

                "review/text": "Those familiar with Harlan Coben's series featuring sports agent sometimes detective Myron Bolitar will delight in this gifted author's latest book, The Innocent. Joining other stand alone books of Mr. oben's like Tell No One and Gone for Good, this book takes its rightful place along with the above mentioned as being a hair raising roller coaster of a read. And one which I imagine most readers will love as I did when Mr. Coben's newest book around the asks the age old question, do we really and truly know the person we're married to. To day this is a really good suspsense book and will have yoru emotions going up and down as the suspsense mounts is an understatemnt.Matt Hunter is 20 years old when during a vacation from a college vacation, he is involved in a brawl and accidentally kills a college student. Although he ha dlittle do with instigating the fight and merely was trying to help a friend, Matt is found at the scene whiel others scurried away and stands trial for the death of another college student.While this most likely was an accident and he may be innocent he is found guilty by a jury and is sentenced to spend several years in prison. Needless to say, as a young suburban man, Matt is less than prepared for prison life but manages to stay alive. When he leaves prison four years later he is taken under the wing of his older brother,a laywer with a prestigious NJ firm which eventually hire Matt as a paralegal. But life for Matt as a convicted felon will never be the same.Now it is nine years later, Matt's brother is dead from a brainaneurysm and his father is also gone. Matt's mother andsister live far away but he still helps out his sister in lawand his two nephews. Matt also continues to work for the same law firm as before but he is now mrried to a wonderful woman, Olivia and they are expecting their first child.He is also about to close on a home in his old neighborhhod and Matt cn't help but think that life is good. But when his wife convinces him to buy two cell phones which can send pictures, this sets in motion a series of events which have Matt wondering who Olivia really is and why is his life spiraling downwards. on one otherwise ordinary day Matt's phone rings andthe sights he sees will once again change life as he knew it.And we as readers now embark alogn with Matt on a whirwind and well thought out plot stretching from New Jerey to Nevadawith a cast of characters we come to know and enjoy.This was a real good read, much better than Coben's last two books, No Second Chance and Just One Look, in my opinion. The characters are fully developed and we are privy to not only what is happening now but what happened to them in the past as well. Readers are able to feel all of the emotions as this story takes off and doesn't let go. One slight change from Mr. Coben's other stand alone books and main characters is that, Matt Hunter isn't quite as sarcastic as other characters found in this author's other books, ie Myron Bolitar This fact makes Matt a much more believable and vulnearble character. And as hardened as Matt may seem from priosn life,underneath we know that he can't believe the world he has made with Olivia is unraveling before his eyes.Harlan Coben's books at best are rather convoluted whichhas been one criticism which I have often heard about his books. I even found myself taking a few notes while reading his books to try and keep one step ahead of these well crafted novels. Overall, though, I found this book a bit easier to keep up with and if I didn't get all of the goings on at the end, Matt Hunter himself says there are some things he won't ever understand either. And this I can live with since I really enjoyed this book. If I had one small criticsm it would be that the end was a bit too coincidental as if the author decided to tie up the book with an ending which readers were hoping would happen.While I have read all of Mr. Coben's stand alone books I haven't read any of his Myron Bolita series books. I hope to read them this summer. And I also am anxiously waiting for Mr. Coben's next stand alone. he can't write them fast enough for me and I highly recommend his books.",

                "review/text": "I love Coben, I really do: Tell No One proved formative in my decision to write genre fiction. I've proceeded to gobble up every stand-alone since Tell, but by the time I finished No Second Chance, his third stand-alone, I noticed Coben had employed THE VERY SAME TWIST IN EACH BOOK. Tell No One, Gone For Good, No Second Chance, Just One Look--the big mystery behind each pivoted on the same identical fulcrum. I wondered: \"Will he ever try something new?\"Enter The Innocent. I prayed and begged the gods of genre fiction that Coben had learned to flex his creative muscles. I bequeathed them burnt offerings as an intercession on Coben's behalf, that they would let the scales fall from his eyes and grow him to be more than a one-trick pony. Please, I wailed, please let The Innocent be different! No more of the same!But the gods must hate me.The Innocent has at its core the same schtick peddled in previous Coben stories which, for the sake of not spoiling your own reading, will not be mentioned in this review. The story had the twists and turns Coben's fans have come to expect, but in the end it seems he's grown quite content to re-gift the same gimmick to us time and again. Not only that, but The Innocent was his second most sloppily-written work behind Just One Look. His description resorts yet again to little more than telling as opposed to showing. The characters are better drawn here than in Look, the ever-present info-dump still frustrates--albeit not as madly as in Look--and the dialogue continues to be embellished and redundant. Furthermore, instances exist when the story FEELS like it's moving forward, but ends up staying in one place till the next chapter or the one after that. Comparatively speaking, Innocent was a welcome semi-return to form after Just One Look (a putrid piece of fiction). It doesn't stand up to Tell, Gone, or even Chance, or even most of the Bolitar series, but thank the fiction gods that at least we don't have to put up with Just One Look II: The Sideways Glance.The message seems to be, \"I'm Harlan Coben, I can take you for a ride, so I can grow lax in the areas not concerned with plot.\" He's since returned to his Bolitar series, and for that we can only hope his schtick has at last come to an end. Read this after Tell, Gone, and Chance (in that order), and skip Look. Be prepared, however, that the more you read his stand-alones the more you'll get the same ol' again and again.",

The romance between Anne and Edward was an added bonus to an already intriguing novel. Most likely because I have a background in the romance genre, I found the sex and the romance not distasteful, in fact finding that it drew a defter hand in concern to the characters and their motivations. And for those who complain that \"The Innocent\" reads like a \"romance\" novel, not so, nearly everything that occured in this novel, even down to the detail to the history, is not something commonly found in the historical romance genre if I may be truthful. I recommend this novel to anyone with a love for history, a female protagonist strong for her times, and a warm love story that heightens the tension of the plot.

I do not consider myself to be prudish, but the graphic, S&M-type sex scenes in the beginning bordered on porn and I kept wondering why such a graphic approach was so necessary - may be offensive to some readers. Some of the text/words seemed inappropriate for the times (the constant referral to the lovers being \"hot\" or thinking another person to be \"hot\" annoyed me). Overall, I definitely enjoyed the book and recommend it. I may even attempt the sequel (it's a trilogy), but can't say that I'm rushing out to locate one.",

Having survived an attempted murder when she was newborn, Anne is a peasant girl who works for English aristocrats. Anne is a beautiful young woman who would have had a much more difficult time in her workplace had it not been for her special abilities as a healer. Her gifts take her as far as looking after the queen. And then Anne meets King Edward IV. She moves into the palace to work for the royals -- where an intense, bittersweet affair with the king begins. There are various twists throughout the novel.I loved the language of this novel. The backdrop of the struggles the royals had in Britain is fascinating and the storytelling is lyrical and beautiful. The story of Anne touched me in many levels. I couldn't keep the book down as she endured all sorts of obstacles and succumbed to her passionate love affair with King Edward IV. The historical references are marvelous and the secondary characters, though in some cases underdeveloped, are compelling. Some readers have complained that this novel reads like a historical romance. There is a romantic subplot centered on Anne and Edward, but there are so many other elements to this novel. You only have to read the synopsis to know that there is some romance in the novel. It is too bad that the aforementioned aspect of literature isn't everyone's cup of tea. I like some romance in literature. Anyway, The Innocent is one of the best reading investments I've made this summer. I recommend this novel most highly and I can't wait to pick up The Exile.",

Her philosophy is she can spend time with the man and get what she wants without the burden of marriage. She keeps a constant reserve of candidates available to fulfill her needs as she carefully guards her heart so as not to fall in love. That is until she meets Dominic Jones.Dominic Jones, a self-made millionaire, has a wife and daughter. Although his future looks bright, he still has to have the company of another woman to keep his juices flowing. He begins a torrid love affair with Tera. Did he do away with her after her constant demands to leave his wife Donna? Jacob Evan is Dominic's rival and one of Tera's many men. Did he kill Tera in a fit of jealous rage? What about Donna? Could she pull off such a heinous crime?This tale of who-done-it leaves the reader guessing until the explosive end. I really enjoyed the fast pace of the novel and the way the author totally blind-sides the reader with the real culprit. The author added layers to Tera's character when she moved her from being a gold-digging diva to a woman desperately seeking the love of a man. She also tapped into the emotions of all the characters. The story totally engages the reader with its twisting plot. For a quick contemporary novel with an element of mystery, I recommend picking this one up.Reviewed by Paula Hendersonof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers",

Some different adjectives come to mind for this one though: boring, convoluted, and dissapointing, just to name a few. It started off well enough, but went downhill before it was 50 pages in. The character of Lucas Davenport was very flat this time, his only focus outside of the case being the multiple women he was juggling and there were way too many supporting characters, causing you to wonder who was who sometimes. The plot itself was dull and lacking in any suspense or tension. You really didn't care waht happened next, which was good, because nothing of interest ever did happen. And the ending appeared out of left field, but by that point you are just glad its over. You get the feeling that Sandford was sitting around one day when he suddenly realized he had a book due soon, and he just hammered it out quickly on autopilot. A character quips near the end of the book, &quot;This is boring my _ brains out&quot;, a quote which could be attributed to the book as well. I hope Sandford and Davenport fare better next time out, I have faith that they will.",

Glaring errors in the proofing can be very distracting.As for getting Davenport to settle down and commit to one woman, I hope he never does! Or at least, not with Weather Karkinnon, she's the dullest of all Sandford's fine creations and I have yet to figure out what Davenport sees in her. I like the predicament Lucas is left in at this book's end, a kind of 'lady or the tiger' deal.

As other reviewers have mentioned, you just have to except the plot device that we could actually develop a faster-than-light starship within the next generation. Much like \"Flood\", this is a very dark story following people living out their entire lives in the most dismal of situations. Like his novel, \"Titan\", Baxter portrays space travel as a very miserable and uncertain endeavor. It's not a complete downer, however, with an overriding theme that human ingenuity can conquer all, albeit a little implausibly sometimes. The novel leaves open room for at least 3 sequels following the continuing stories left open in this universe.",

                "review/text": "Having read several other Baxter books, I found this now two-book SF series to be quite refreshing considering how other series he's either fully authored or co-authored. What I do like about the future Baxter paints in both Flood and Ark is that technological advancement seems to freeze in a not too far future, making this personally for me very believable. Although some of the technology presented later on (such as the collection of anti-matter, creation of the warp bubble and superluminal interstellar flight) may seem a little far-fetched - yet! - the author uses much of older and recent scientific research and discussion as background for his book. In other words, he has blended imagination and science in a very successful way.Unlike another customer review here, I actually do think you should read the previous book, Flood, to understand Ark. Flood sets the desperate, gruesome and gloomy mood of the everflooding Earth and an apparent dying humanity. Ark represents the faint hope that is presented at the very end of the first book. I feel the stories are inextricably intertwined and equally important to understand the series.The only reason why I don't give this book 5 stars is that I found it too short (!) and that it was a tiny bit less exciting than Flood.But if you like a believable story about exploration of exo-planets, a play on how we might escape the solar system with a semi-current level of technology well mixed with a good human drama - Ark is for you.",

At a Minneapolis party hosted by Sally Hanson, Alie'e enjoys the drugs and sex that flow so freely.That ends when (...). Minneapolis Deputy of Police Lucas Davenport heads the investigation that has media and political attention due to Alie'e being the victim. For a cop this case becomes a living nightmare due to the media's sensationalizing what happened at the party. However, the case turns uglier when (,,,). Lucas has numerous suspects, but the investigation twists again when one of his own crew is almost killed by the clever perpetrator.The Davenport books are all hard hitting, hard-boiled, and hard edged police procedurals that turn up the adrenaline pump to extraordinary levels for the reader. EASY PREY starts off in the stratosphere and never comes down even at its climax. The charcaters are fully developed and the subplots that tie back to the fast-paced story line bring them to life even as it adds fuel to the speed of the novel. Lucas remains a complex but enigmatic protagonist and fans of the sub-genre will enjoy his exploits tremendously. John Sandford is worth the price of hard cover as he proves that reading is still a pleasant experience even with the coming of Play Station 2.Harriet Klausner",

                "review/text": "Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of the sci-fi genre, alas, Space ships and warp drives do not a good sci-fi novel make. The story is borderline hilarious and it feels like one of those incredibly corny sci-fi channel B movies: a flood mysteriously begins to take over the land mass of the earth due to VAST underground lakes suddenly leaking their contents up into the world's oceans. All of this beginning in the year 2012... come on, Mr. Baxter. Feeding off the apocalyptic paranoia that has sprouted over the years and mixing it ever so slightly with Global Warming he has created this mediocre story that doesn't seem to go anywhere for a good while.The story begins in the year 2040 and leaves you there for a couple pages and then sends you back in time to get the back story on the main character, Holle Groundwater... sounds like a name out of a novel filled with dwarves and dragons, but that's beside the point. The chapters that serve as backstory do not serve any real purpose other than to list a bunch of names of people you are supposed to get to know, in the few lines the speak and the very few actions they have. I could not sympathize with or empathize with ANY of the characters except, perhaps Holle. And the random scene of a young teenager rubbing one out for the pedophile teacher... could have done without that too, seeing as how it was already alluded to that there was molestation and underage sex going on. - no I do not have repressed issues, because I see comments about this from hecklers coming, it's just weird to have that scene randomly thrown in -Contrary to another reviewer, I do not believe that this author hates babies: the theme is about babies being the future of mankind, so it only makes sense to allude to the dangers posed to them on the journey and to have the characters deal with these events. I do not think Ark is some type of political garbage heap about Global Warming and whatnot, it's just a very mediocre story.Events moved by much too fast, and I feel that the entire backstory would have been much more entertaining and meaningful if the entire novel had been dedicated to it... so instead of racing through the lives of the characters at break-neck speeds, we could have taken the time to get to know them and actually feel something for them rather than just be indifferent towards them when they die or get left out of things, or get the daylights beaten out of them. The entire story could have been a trilogy: Flood, Ark, and then another novel that comprised the after-backstory element, as it stands \"Ark\" feels like one bad story with another 'could have been better' story quickly thrown in and just as quickly thrown out. And I chose to give it 2 stars because 1 and a half was not an option and I feel sorry enough to scale up rather than scale down.If you're going to read it I suggest you either: take it out of a library, buy it at a bookstore and then return it after reading, or just buy the book used because it does not hold up well enough to be read again and it is not something that anyone who calls themselves a sci-fi fan would want to have on their shelf. Final words: should have been made into a sci-fi channel movie of the week because it's just as easily forgettable and it would have saved a lot of resources being wasted on its printing.",

I can't give an exact example right now, but I know there were instances that were repeated within one or two pages of each other. That happens to all writers I'm sure.

Writing as a long-time fan of John Sandford, I am posting this review with a great sense of disappointment. I wanted to like this novel, but I just couldn't.It seems like Sandford has devolved into pure formula when I used to find his books full of originality and surprises. With Easy Prey, we just have the same old cast of characters involved in the same old investigative activities, and none of it is very involving. While I won't give away the identity of the killer for the true fans out there who will have to read this for themselves, I found the ending to be lazy on Sandford's part and thought it made the majority of the book seem irrelevant.In a literary world that offers the likes of Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane, Ridley Pearson and Jeffery Deaver, I would have to say that Sandford is rapidly falling to the bottom of the suspense writer ranks. I find that unfortunate since I remember the days when Sandford could come up with a better plot twist than a new dead body. It seems like in Easy Prey that whenever Sandford loses his bearings he just kills off another minor character. Given the number of death in the novel, it appears that Sandford lost his way far to many times.",

This would not be such an unusual thing for a homicide detective except for the fact that it looks as though werewolves may be the problem. Especially when the killer looks as though he is the prince of the clan Nokolai, Rule Turner.

Little does she know she has been the chosen mate for Rule and there is nothing she can do about it...unless she wants to turn her back on her heart.Together Rule and Lily investigate the killings and through investigating, finds that the killer may just be a cop and one that Lily is working with. Why is the killer trying to make the murders look as if a werewolf committed them and why? Now it's a race against time and a killer who may just be magical in it's own way.This was a fast paced read.

In the beginning of the book, Lily is called to the scene of a murder, and she immediately realizes this is not your ordinary crime scene. The victim appears to have been attacked and killed--by a werewolf, or lupus.During the course of her investigation, she is introduced to the handsome and charismatic lupi prince, Rule Turner. Despite her unwillingness to be drawn in by his charm, she finds she can't help herself. Rule is likewise drawn to Lily and quickly realizes there is much more between them than just passion. But Lily has secrets of her own which prevent her from opening up to just anyone (not to mention the fact that Rule is a lupus), and Rule, too, is not exactly an open book. Readers will quickly realize their relationship is going to be complicated.Rule and Lily begin to investigate the murders together, and their blossoming relationship is put to the test when Rule becomes the prime suspect by one of Lily's fellow officers.There is much more to the plot than just murder--there's the lupi world, Lily's own past, federal agents, sorcerers, Lily's wise grandmother, gnomes, and dark magic.I enjoyed this book very much. I did become rather frustrated at times, because much was insinuated and hinted at about Lily's past, but nothing was truly revealed until much later in the book. This kept me from feeling as though I knew and understood her. I found it frustrating to be held at a distance from the main character I assumedly should like. Therefore, it was difficult for me to determine whether or not I actually LIKED Lily. However, her actions were enough to demonstrate she is an honest, complicated, tough, independent, and stubborn woman who will never be content to sit at home while the boyfriend goes out and takes care of the bad guys. I liked that about her, and I imagine a lot of readers will, too.I will be looking forward to reading more about Lily and Rule. The next book, MORTAL DANGER, is out now. Eileen Wilks also has a third book, BLOODLINES, due out in January 2007. All in all, this was a good book, and I recommend it to fans of the paranormal genre.",

                "review/text": "I am a fan of urban fantasy novels, particularly Patricia Briggs' Mercy Thompson series, and I am not generally a fan of detective stories or romances. So perhaps my criticism isn't fair, since I would put this novel only incidentally in the urban fantasy genre and more in the detective/romance genres. That said, I really didn't think it was a very good story. I did finish it, but wasn't terribly compelled to do so.The characters in this story are wooden, and I never actually found myself rooting for any of them. Even when Lily reveals her painful secret, I didn't feel that any real dimension had been added to her character. Her dialogue is cliched; even her thoughts are cliched. We are told that she's tough and smart before we're actually shown evidence of that, and it comes off as lecture instead of entertainment. And Rule, don't even get me started. Rule is a cliche in and of himself. He has a \"crooked and charming smile\" (give me a break) and is every bit the Tall Dark and Handsome you would expect to find in any dime store romance novel. Nothing he does rings true, even the loving relationship he's supposed to have with his eight year old son seems choreographed; the author might as well have just skipped over it entirely and said \"hey readers, Rule loves his son.\" It would have seemed a lot less trite.The werewolves themselves are ridiculous; they are all male, which I suppose is part of what makes them so super-sexy, at least that's what the author seems to want us to think. Add to that the fact that they all wear cutoff Levis and nothing else, and we get the point. Werewolves are way, way sexy. Bare-chestedly, naked-leggedly sexy.Most annoyingly of all though is the universe where the story takes place. It isn't very well constructed, and the author just invents all of the magical and mystical laws as she goes along, where ever they are convenient. Cullen uses \"sorceri\" to cause an explosion, but we never really understand what the hell a \"sorceri\" actually is. The super-sexy \"mate bond\" that holds Lily and Rule together seems totally fabricated, and no one really explains what its purpose is, or why it's so rare. Along the way we discover that the bad guys worship a goddess who dislikes the goddess that the werewolves worship, and apparently the werewolves were created to fight this super bad goddess, but there's no history behind that supposed relationship, we're just told \"Oh yeah, by the way, we were created to fight this goddess.\"And the sex scenes, god, if I'd had to read the words \"his need for her\" or \"her need for him\" or any other incarnation of that phrase one more time I'd have puked. Oh and then there's the part where Rule is challenged for dominance by Lily's cat, and there is an actual dominance fight between cat and person. This might actually be the stupidest thing I've ever read. In fact, maybe just buy this novel so you can read that scene, because I couldn't possibly do justice to how stupid it actually is.A lot of really boring stuff happens too. They make coffee. They sit around and read through files (boring enough in real life, extra boring in a novel). They talk to each other about how they are going to attack the bad guys (the author spends more time talking about their plans then she actually spends on the execution of their plans). The climax is too fast and is utterly lacking in suspense.Finally, the loose ends never get tied up. Things never get explained (a werewolf committed the first murder under the compulsion of the Aza, but which werewolf?). We never even find out how a person becomes a werewolf ... we assume it's genetic, but what about all the old stories about werewolf bites? Don't we need to know how that fits in to the werewolf society in the novel? And at one point they seem to be alluding to the idea that Rule can no longer change into a wolf, but by the middle of the story it becomes clear that that's not true, but the author never explains where the hell she was going with that idea.This is just not a very satisfying book. If you're looking for really good urban fantasy, look elsewhere.",

Werewolves (lupi) have only recently been accorded some rights; previously they were hunted and killed by the police. However they are still regarded with suspicion and this death doesn't help. It looks like the prime suspect is Rule Turner, the prince of the local werewolf clan, and Lily goes to interview him. However she soon realises that the murder didn't happen as it seems on the surface and that there is some kind of connection between her and Rule. The more they investigate together the more is uncovered - someone in the police department working against them, suspicions amongst the lupi, mistrust of Lily as she seems close to a lupus, an evil female deity trying to take over the world, that kind of thing.Although billed as a romance in some ways this book wasn't too romantic - the lead characters don't exactly choose to have their relationship and much more attention is paid to the murder and sorcery plot. It's written fairly well and I liked the characters, particularly Lily's grandmother, and the differences between the lupus and human social mores were interesting, but the overall story wasn't enough to completely carry me away into the plot. The big fight at the end was over surprisingly quickly and that was the only real taste of action in the story - the novel was more focused on investigation and plotting. The magical world it was set in had that slight drawback that too many other urban fantasies seem to have these days - peopling the world with every possible type of non-human creature like werewolves, gnomes, sorcerers, banshees, witches, goddesses and the like; the only thing missing in this story seemed to be vampires. It was a pleasant enough read but not exciting enough to entice me to buy another book by this author.",

The main character is a very strong and canny Chinese American police detective, Lily Yu.A nicely original character that makes a very realistic homicide investigator, who is also a \"sensitive\". Since anything magical has been suspect for a long time, Lily is in a \"don't ask, don't tell\" situation and uses of her gift are under the radar and not mentioned in reports. Being officially \"outed\" would mean her badge, but when her gift tells her the latest murders she is investigating are the result of sorcery and not a rogue werewolf she has some hard choices to make. Rule Turner is the equivalent of a werewolf prince, and he's being framed by powerful forces that have hidden agents inside the police department itself. Lily who has always been the type to 'color inside the lines' is going to have to cross the lines to do the right thing. It doesn't help that there is an incredible attraction between Lily and Rule, one deeper than mere animal attraction.The book maintains a high level of suspense all the way through. The story unfolds slowly, revealing not only secrets of Lily's past and the exotic culture of the lupi, but a dire threat of dark gods on the brink of finding a way from their own realm into our own.309 pages, very jam packed. Excerpt at the end shows a sequel with the same main characters of Lily and Rule.",

That novella was my favorite of the originals in Cravings.It is definitely a fast paced read. I think the story line, the romance, the soul mates aspect (which was a favorite of mine), the mixture of preternatural; all of it was a good mix. I do however think she could have spent more time flushing it all out. I felt she left some details that would have been nice to see out. It almost made it feel incomplete.Will I continue the series? I can't wait, so yes. Rule and Lily you can't help but love not to mention the array of others involved. Are they rereadable to me? No. I will only read Tempting danger one time, maybe skim through it when Mortal Danger come out, but other than that, I am trough with it.",

To find what she needs, she must gain the wolf clan's acceptance, and Rule Turner is the key to doing that. Though it goes against police ethics regarding conflict of interest, Lily and Rule's relationship moves from business to beyond pleasure, making the case personal and doubly dangerous.**** Suspense and passion will keep you flipping pages rapidly until the end comes too soon. Readers will be glad to know this is only the first in a series focusing on Lily and Rule. Ms Wilks has crafted a new world of urban fantasy that will appeal to Laurrell K Hamilton and Melanie Jackson fans. Combining Indian and Oriental culture with her own version of the werewolves has resulted in a series that has depth from the get go. ****",

She realizes that this is no ordinary killer. Evidence points towards the Nokolai werewolf clan's Prince Rule Turner.When someone viciously assaults his father, the clan leader, Rule concludes he can no longer let the officials investigate the murders that make him the prime suspect. He is fortunate that the lead police investigator is not only open-minded, but smells a frame. Lily and Rule team up to try to stop a Lupi serial killer from murdering more innocent people, but neither realized that their partner is their lifemate though both feel the attraction from the start.Talk about living dangerously, Eileen Wilks takes her novella \"Only Human\" from the terrific paranormal romance anthology LOVER BEWARE and lengthens it into a fantastic full length novel. The story line contains all the excitement and more as readers gain a greater understanding of the werewolf species and insight into the lead couple. Lily and Rule are a fabulous pairing who must first weed out a rogue killer before they can explore their feelings. Ms. Wilks takes a chance and readers are the winners.Harriet Klausner",

She wrote a novella that appears in Lover Beware that has the same two lead characters but otherwise is a totally different story. If you've read the novella, it is sort of disorienting to read the books in the series. Read them in order. Each book stands alone but the characters are richer when they develop over time. Wilks has a very interesting take on werewolves and has put a lot of thought into the structure of their society. It is a very romantic book. The relationship between Lily and Rule is very realistic. It's not quite your usual they hate each other, they have sex, they're madly in love plot. In this book, they need each other but they're not really sure they can stand to be together. I am really looking forward to the fourth book. One of my favorite things about the series is that the characters are moving from book to book. I always want more of a good character so I enjoy series that feature the same characters in multiple books.",

I was dissappointed that such a seemingly self assured heroine turned wimpy as soon as Lucia-who the author really plays up as extremely beautiful-meets her.The character Lucia turned me off as well, as she was written very coldly. The hero, or romantic lead is bland, and seems to have his own agenda, leading the heroine blindly into some dangerous situations, but evasively telling her to \"watch out\"-blech!!All that aside, I just found the story inplausible-this \"dream\" offer of a private eye firm quickly turning into a life or death situation-both heroines almost killed, and no idea or hint as to why.It may get better, I'll never know.3 stars for a pretty good start.",

Devil's Bargain is an honest to goodness face-hugger of a read, the kind I can never find enough of and am oh-so-grateful when one does come down the pike. My hat is off to the publishers for bringing in skilled writers of this caliber who can deliver edgy, believable characters and a clich&eacute;-free page-turning story. Make sure you set aside enough time to read it in one sitting. I'm not kidding here, it made me late for work!This book is more than strong enough to stand on its own in the mystery/thriller genres, written in a clear, crisp style that made the read seem like I was watching a movie in my head. I've enjoyed the other Bombshell books, but this one has significantly raised the bar. Caine's secret? Really cool characters, true to themselves to the point of risking everything to do what's right. Good choices, bad choices, they deal with the consquences, however crazy it gets.Jazz, the heroine, is by no imaginative stretch a shrinking violet. How many dames do you know who take on drunken bikers on their own turf---and win? To be fair, she had the upper hand since she'd not yet had her coffee. The hero, James, is a match for her, balancing her raw power and passion with stubborn courage, a clever wit, and a sexy glint in his eye. (Not to mention that killer wardrobe.) There were times I wanted to toss a net over Jazz and jump his bones myself, he's so hot. It's clear to everyone he's fallen for her at first sight, but Jazz is the last to figure it out. (Hey, she's BUSY taking out bad guys, okay?) In lesser hands this wouldn't fly, but Caine's deft word-craft not only has her getting breezily away with it, makes you love it, and leaves you hungry for more, more, more.I hope there will be more to come from this awesome writer!Now please excuse me, I'm going to re-read this one again.",

The questions and suspense kept coming and by the end of the book you are left scratching your head over the mystery and where it is leading.All in all, a great story. This book is different from her Weather Warden series but just as well written and interesting. At best I would call this a paranormal mystery series in the works. So if you are a fan of Caine's, check this new series out and for the price it is a really good bargain!Great job, Ms. Caine!",

The only stipulation is that she partners with Lucia Garza, a former USAF Security Police Officer Law Enforcement Supervisor who she has never met. Though she does not like knowing more about these enigmatic benefactors, she agrees to their terms.After a less than amiable first call between the two tough females, they agree to meet though they are across the country from one another as neither trusts their unknown benefactor. However, the 100K check they already received is good so the duo agree to the terms. As the two sleuths conduct an investigation for their new employers, the case turns dangerous. James tries to help the women, but neither Jazz nor Lucia wants a civilian in the way. Someone wants the inquiries stopped or else; but these two tough females are too obstinate to back down over a threat even if it is to them.Though the investigation is convoluted and starts relatively late, readers who appreciate strong female action heroines will want to read DEVIL'S BARGAIN. The testosterone flows on every page in which either Lucia or Jazz appear starting from the beginning the latter kicks butt in a bar and never lessons until the final kick butt climax even when Jazz and James make love.

Fans and newcomers alike will be delighted with her skill at combining powerful, emotional and deeply-grounded characterizations with sensitive, penetrating and up to the minute dialogue. The main players fairly leap off the page, and their stories unfold against a backdrop so vivid, you almost feel as if you're right there watching them.The plot does take a bit of time to get going, and is heavily laced with a mystical or maybe even futuristic bent. Kind of like a fusion of \"X-Files\" meets the current TV hit \"Numb3rs.\" It may take a bit of work to follow, but it's intriguing enough to hang in there for some big payoffs in the end. There's exposition here. A lot of it. But I understand this is the first in a new series from Caine, and if her Weather Warden novels are anything to go by, I know that each new installment is likely to build on the strengths of the last. With Devil's Bargain, we've got Jazz Callender, Lucia Garza, James Borden and their world. Now it's time to bring on the stories.

Epiphany Wright, Keisha Moore and Shana Scott continue their drama-filled lives from book one. Because of her gold-digging ways, Epiphany finds herself near death and a close friend actually dead. When she awakens from her coma, she doesn't remember what happened which is a good thing for a gangster named C-God and his partner Ness because they are the ones responsible. If Epiphany remembers, their best bet will be for the cops to get them first because street justice can be a killer.Keisha does the unthinkable due to loneliness. She has it all: a nice job, a beautiful home, a child, and a man who would do anything for her, but she tosses it away for a brief romp in the sack that was unfortunately caught on tape. But was it really her fault? Or did she have some help from the little green-eyed monster?With her man, K. C., fresh out of the joint, Shana is doing her thing and keeping it real while making some money. But she has a secret and is praying K. C. doesn't find out. Sadly, someone else wants a piece of her action and is willing to blackmail her to get it. What price is she willing to pay to keep it a secret?This was definitely a page-turner from beginning to end. Ms. Baker did an excellent job capturing enough details from the first book so that STILL SHEISTY could stand alone. The drama was so thick that I found myself caught up in the lives of the main characters from the get go. This book was about what goes around comes around. Each of the main characters taught a lesson about the choices we make and the repercussions that follow. You may be getting yours now, but, in the end, there is a price to pay. Although I enjoyed the action-packed, drama-filled pages, I felt some fine-tuning was needed in the editing department. There were enough typographical and grammatical errors to make this a distracting read at times. Despite that, this is one book I'm sure will be a big hit with the hip-hop generation.

She got killed at the end. Keisha took 6 bullets with Epiphanys name on them. OOOh I cried. I get emotionally attached. Even Shana turned her life around. Their has to be more happy endings.

After the 3rd or 4th one, you start to lose track of which betrayed and desperate agent is running from which evil and corrupted government agency. They sorta run together, don't they? It's Ludlum's formula and it has obviously served him very well.&quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is a different kettle of fish, though. There's no mistaking this one with anything else Ludlum, or anyone else, has written. This book kicks some serious posterior.There were times in the middle of it that my head was spinning. What the heck was going on? If the action wasn't so insanely great, I might have bailed. But the action, my God, the action... Andy McNab is the only other writer that I'm aware of who can write action as well, but even his pales in comparison.The plot eventually makes itself clear, and it's pretty cool when it does. And have I mentioned the action? There are so many absolutely great scenes that I'm not even going to bother listing them. Trust me, it's good stuff.OK, so the scene on the grounds of the Embassy house is drawn out a bit too long, and some of the dialog in that same scene is a little silly, but that's nitpicky. This is BY FAR the best Ludlum has ever done, and it's in my Top 5 of all time. READ THIS BOOK!",

Again the government needs his help as Jason Bourne or Delta, the man from Medusa and Threadstone 71. Knowing that he will not volunteer his help after all that CIA and State Department have done to him, a story is rigged and his wife is kidnapped. Webb snaps and in the desired effect is on his way to Asia to track a Bourne-impostor who is killing highly-placed officials in Kowloon and Hong Kong. Things run off the wire when Bourne's wife escapes her custody and finds help at the Canadian consulate from an old friend.While the whole story is as action-packed and twisted as the first installment of the Bourne trilogy, it is a little bit harder to get into at the beginning and seems overall a bit more constured. Ludlum is a master of complicated scenarios and he moves about his many locations and characters with ease and skill. He storylines are well-drawn and compelling, but in direct comparison the book is no match to its pre-decessor.",

We get it and don't need to relive that conflict over and over and over and over and... you get my point.Ludlum also makes dialogue very difficult to follow (e.g., which character is speaking once the conversation gets going)... very frustrating. The attempted rape on Marie copied from the Bourne Identity bothered me. Is it her lot in life to almost get raped in every book? The capture of the impostor assassin was aggravating. The real Bourne tells the fake Bourne &quot;if you try anything, I'll kill you&quot; about 50 times within one chapter. After the tenth time, I figure idle threats begin to lose their luster.I actually enjoyed tossing this book in the trash after completing 475 pages. I was almost 200 pages from the end and couldn't care less how it ended. There is a reason why the movie doesn't follow the storyline from the book. It's a bad book.",

I would not pass it by if you have read the first in the series, but Ludlum seemed to drag on way to much making a lot of the book a little dull. The beginning grabs you, and wont let go for a good 200 pages, but then things get slow, and I actually found myself wanting to stop reading. That is not like me at all. It is also the reason this book took me almost 3 months to read, between giving it a break for faster paced novels and me rather sleeping than staying up to read it.After struggling through the middle 200 pages, I got hooked again, and ended up reading the rest of the book in a matter of days. I could not put it down.So, I guess I can say that it is not a total flop, and I am still planning on reading the third in the Bourne series, but I only gave it three stars because of the slow middle.You should at least pick this book up and read it for the awesome beginning and ending 200 pages.",

(I'm currently halfway through the third installment of the Bourne series by Robert Ludlum -- The Bourne Supremacy.) There are several reasons why I liked this story better than the first. The first is that it is set in places in Southeast Asia like Hong Kong, Macao and China. Since I grew up in the Philippines and have visited these places during summer and Christmas time for roughly 18 years, it feels familiar. This sequel recaps what happens in the first novel in a very seemless, unobtrusive manner (a good thing). He reminds the user about why Bourne does the things he does and feels the way he feels. There's definitely more action and ass-whuppin' in this novel. He kills without compunction (when he has to) and his methods are, as noticed by his clone, that of a technician's. There's less of the mental anguish he felt in the first book as an amnesiac; therefore, less random ramblings in his mind. There are actually two stories happening in parallel. That of Bourne trying to reach his wife, and that of his wife trying to reach her husband.The only gripe I do have about the dialogue and the asian characters in the story is their flowery use of words and seemingly religious devotion to Christianity. I can tell you for a fact that although Christianity has its influences and followers in Asia, we do not bring in gods, spirits, and Christ into every sentence we utter. It's a symptom of the author mistranslating common colloquial sayings or metaphors. He also seems to think asians use &quot;Aiyaa!&quot; a lot. Grandmothers or old wenches in a marketplace might use this word when spreading gossip or haggling over prices, but typically not men -- military or civilian.I'm going to try something new in my reviews. I'm going to introduce my own criteria for ranking a book (recurring factors I seem to comment on over and over again) on a scale from 0-5, and hopefully the average will correspond to a more accurate rating for the book. I'll call it the FLAP system:* Flagpole factor (F) - In keeping with the bromide that sex, crime and violence sells, this covers the first aspect. Were there any erotic scenes?* Use of Language (L) - How's the dialogue? Is it affected? Does it reflect the vernacular of the setting? Is it preachy?* Action (A) - How are the action scenes described? Are they as lame as Clive Cussler's? What are the weapons used? How gory were the kills?* Plot (P) - How predictable is the story? Is it a page turner?F:1 (there was a rape scene)L:4 (use of local speech)A:5 (describes tools of the trade, lots of kills)P:4.5 (keeps you guessing)",

He uses lots of italics, lots of exclamation points, his characters' inner thoughts are beyond cliche, and attempts at romantic dialogue are laughable. But still, somehow, he grips pulp fiction espionage enough to make one want to finish his books. While I didn't hate this, I couldn't say I liked it.

                "review/text": "I've been reading Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta novels on and off for some time now. There was a time when these stories were innovative, and even groundbreaking in their introduction of the strong female lead into the serial killer, suspense genre. But something happened along the way. I don't know if Cornwell changed her story lines for her own reasons or due to bad advice, but rather than forensic suspense the stories turned into adventures in dysfunctional families. Scarpetta became a flaming codependent trying to mother Lucy, whose goal in life was staying in trouble. And Pete Marino, never the most likeable of characters became increasingly large, loud and obnoxious. To put it bluntly, the killers were often the most attractive characters in the stories.Cornwell long ago fell off my 'buy in hardback' list. But when I picked up Predator the blurb sounded pretty good, and I decided to give Cornwell another try. The story finds Kay Scarpetta, Pete Marino, and a whole cast of crimestoppers working at the National Forensic Academy, the institute Lucy created so that she could work as a free agent. All isn't well at the Academy, strange events and thefts are interspersed with intense personality conflicts and mistrust until it is obvious that a crisis is brewing.In the meantime a subtle series of deaths and disappearances come to light that seem to link Basil Jenrette, an imprisoned serial killer who has become the subject of Benton Wesley's research into the deviant mind, with killers down in Florida where the academy is. The connections surface painstakingly slowly after in depth forensic work. This is the formula which made Cornwell a success, and I hoped for a return to the Scarpetta of the early stories.Unfortunately, that was not to be. Most of the suspense is about which character will have an argument with another, not with the forensic work. Kay Scarpetta literally shotguns the research work, creating a haphazard web of clues and red herrings. If it wasn't for Pat Cornwell's determination to give the whole story away by continually inviting the reader into the mind of the killer (and a very boring killer he is, by the way) the plot would have been almost impossible to follow. It is almost as if Cornwell wrote a bunch of short episodes and then put them in a semblance of order without any effort at continuity. I'll probably never know whether the ending was intended to be a cliff hanger or if the story was abandoned to its loose ends.It's a shame that this series has been allowed to degenerate the way it has. Cornwell seems to be convinced that if she cannot breath new life into her characters she can succeed by making them so pitiable that the reader will succumb to guilt and read the yet another book. My recommendation is that, under no circumstances buy the hardback. Wait for the paperback if you will, although you may find the time best spent reading something else.",

                "review/text": "I remember loving the early Scarpetta books. Flanked by an array of interesting characters, she was definitely front and center in every story (as was proven by the fact that the books were written in the first person). She was a capable medical examiner, but also a skilled cook (Cornwell's delicious descriptions of Kay's Italian recipes in her gourmet kitchen were so vivid, you could almost smell the food), and a woman with a sense of humor. She and her sidekicks (Marino, Lucy, Benton, etc.), though surrounded by tragedy and death, did have happy moments, and were capable of being happy at times.Then something happened a couple of books ago: after a tired plotline about a European \"werewolf\" which spanned a couple of books, the point of view changed to third person, the story became much more of an ensemble cast with Scarpetta as one of the characters, and everything became permeated by a depressing, unhappy, dreary atmosphere that sucked the happiness out of the characters, and turned them into automatons who did nothing else but work, argue, and deal with death. Gone was any \"off-time\", sense of humor, or even sense of hope. Gone was also any sense of realism, as every new books showed Lucy's fortune more and more outlandish with mansions, academies, motorcycles, helicopters, improbable stunts and toys of all kinds.This time we're asked to believe Lucy's fortune has started a private \"academy\" that supports police investigation. But what happened to Lucy's previous endeavors, The Last Precinct? What about other characters present in the previous book that have been dropped without so much as a mention? And how about the new ones in this book whom we are asked to know about without ever having heard about them (when Johnny Swift was being talked about as if I was supposed to know who he was, I swear I thought I skipped a book)? How much time has passed between Trace and Predator? It's really hard to tell.Let's move on to the story. It seems that we've traded the suspense and interesting crime scene investigations by Scarpetta's team of talented forensic scientists of the eralier novels, for incredibly gruesome, sick, twisted descriptions of tortured, mutilated, decomposing bodies, simply described for shock factor. I am not sure how someone comes up with twisted stuff like this, but I had to put the book down at one point when one of the villains (Jenrette) described how he blinded his victims. It was just too much. Perhaps Cornwell might want to consider subjecting herself to the Predator study? She should know better than to replace storytelling with pure guts/gore. Her readers are smarter than that. Blood and a truly convoluted plot line are not cutting it.",

                "review/text": "Anyone who has read the entire Scarpetta series, particularly in order, has noticed several changes. First, the books began to explore the dysfunctional traits of the main characters - namely Scarpetta, Marino, Benton, and Lucy.In the beginning, this made the characters more \"human.\" At some point, however, the dysfunctional traits became so pronounced, and the books began to spend so much time concentrating on the dysfunctional, that the characters became caricatures. Is that bad? Not necessarily - just a change in Cornwell's writing and not what many fans are looking for.As the series progressed, Scarpetta became the target of jealous politicians, then jealous co-workers, then . . . well, it reached the point where every psychopath and every character outside the key four had, as their life's goal, giving Scarpetta her comeuppance. That was tolerable, until it became such an overwhelming part of each book that you got the idea that every mass murderer in Slovenia awakened each morning with a single thought - \"forget being a criminal here in Slovenia; I can only satisfy my blood lust by pitting myself against The Great Kay Scarpetta. When does the next plane leave for Richmond?\"The fact that Lucy is a lesbian starting becoming the central theme of each book. Nothing wrong with this, but each successive book seemed to try harder to punish Lucy for that fact. After the infamous Bennett divorce lawsuit (in which Cornwell was alleged to have been the adulterous lesbian lover of Bennett's wife), the character Lucy (and not the homophobic FBI) appeared determined to punish herself by knowingly traveling down a spiraling course of self-destruction tied to her sexual orientation. By the time of Predator, ten pages of Lucy is enough to convince you she NEEDS to commit suicide before the destruction gets any greater. Heck, I was ready to help her kill herself -- you know, as a friend.Scarpetta began to leave the medical examiner's office and instead became a multi-tasking crimefighter who knew more about each aspect of a criminal investigation than anyone else, and either performed that aspect herself or supervised and interpreted it. It became hard to understand how she was the world expert on everything - sort of like watching the TV show \"House,\" and wondering what alternate universe the characters live in, where four hospital physicians (presumably internists) perform every procedure themselves: drawing the blood, doing the work of techs in the lab, running the MRI (instead of technicians), interpreting all films without help of a radiologist, and entering abandoned houses and patients' homes to look for clues.By the time of Predator, the main characters consist of a nothing but a pile of exaggerated and dysfunctional stereotypes, the writing has become dark and unfocused, the plot line is overly complex (adding complexity, I might note, without adding any additional intrigue, unique plot twists, or opportunities to develop any realistic character trait in the characters is just adding complexity for the sake of complexity). You now are asked to forget about the sole-miscreant-from-Slovenia-type persecution of Scarpetta and are assured that at least 63 percent of the globe's residents have, as their sole purpose in life, to damage the reputation of The Great Scarpetta for perceived slights, or to knock her from her pedestal. Apparently, three sections of USA Today and 53 minutes of each hour of CNN tell the why Kay Scarpetta is superior to the readers/viewers, in such fashion so as to inspire retaliatory acts by the rest of civilization.Misspellings (or just the incorrect use of words) abound in Predator. Was there an editor? \"Facts\" about federal medical privacy laws are flatly wrong. Was there a fact checker? With each turn of a page, I was prepared for the following sentence: \"Scarpetta, attoned in a cashmere jacklet in a hue of purple so beautiful that the International Consortium of Dye Manufactures had hired a pare of midget conjoined twins with U.S. Marine commendificationables for marksmanship while killing on-the-wing pigeons with a hand-held howitzer, and so filled with self-loathing that she had intentionally dropped the IHOP pancakes on the floor before eating them and slapping the handicapped busboy, hotwired the '64 Morgan (smirking as she realized she was the last aliving person who knew that the wiring plan of this car differed from the published version because this car was made in the Manchester plant during the strike of August 3-9; she knew this from recognizing the intials of a union-busing scab brake installer -- the man she had dated but who died on the ill-fated 1987 expedition to Everest -- who had scratched them into the inside of the rear fender (hmm . . . clearly one with a sharpened piece of the carriage return of 1934 Remington typewriter, and using his left hand, thought Scarpetta, remembering the bitter taste of blood in her mouth when he would hit her after she knowingly egged him on to the point of violence by making comments about how he was not worthy of her) while noting from the texture of the dried spittle on the seat that the previous owner had suffered from a rare disease of the saliva glands only known to have occurred once previously, in Madagascar, as Marino, whose tatooed weight-lifter's biceps were now larger than his massive waste) passed her at 364 miles per hors-deourve on a custom motorcycles handbuilt from parts discarded by the set designers of the move, Mad Max, on his way to collect his $70,000 monthly salary for turning Scarpetta's files off strange forensic findings into \"hell scenes\" to train other forensic investigators who will always be less talented than Scarpetta, and who universally hate her for that fact.\" Not that I'm bitter about having purchased this book without reading reviews of it first. And not that I, too, like all of the characters in the book, am filled with self-loathing -- in my case for believing that the downward spiral of the Scarpetta series would somehow stop with this book. On second thought, given the darkness of the book and the short sentence structure, a sample section probably would be more likely to read: \"Marino hated himself. He did something to hurt himself and Scarpetta. Lucy killed a kitten. She relished its last breath. Scarpetta snarled at a helper. Then she insulted a witness.\"In short, you might like this book standing alone, if looking for dark fiction about unlikeable characters in factual situations that aren't supposed to resemble something that MIGHT happen in true life. If, however, you're looking to re-capture some of the glory that was the original forensic mystery, with its believably complex characters, then you will be gravely disappointed.At the end of his career, James A. Michener was said to use his graduate students at the University of Texas to write the last few chapters of his books - he'd grown tired of the topic and the characters, and left so many loose ends that he couldn't tie them up in a coherent fashion. The last few chapters, the newly introduced characters were shallow charactures, the old characters suddenly changed their personalities completed, and there were Deus Et Machina moments where thirty chapters of loose ends were tied up in two sentences, leaving you with a feeling that you had been robbed of closure.Predator? Well, it reads as if Cornwell hired Michener's ghostwriters for this book, and those ghostwriters tired after the first sentence and hired another ghostwriter - someone who has never read the initial three to five Scarpetta books, has no grasp of any normal traits that the characters were expected to possess, and has taken the crime novel to a \"suspend all beliefs\" piece of poorly written \"it was a dark and story night\" quality fiction. Sorry, Ms. Cornwell, I'll continue to read your early books, lend them to others, and promote their purchase, but you can keep Predator and any subsequent books that don't try to make a single character believable, that have no characters who are likeable or with whom the reader identifies, and that continue to have the world in conspiracy against The Great Scarpetta.This review is so long that I'm not bothering to proof it for problems like misused words, or for any over-the-top premises that might turn a reader off. Kind of like Cornwell did with Predator.",

It all began to go downhill when \"Silence of the Lambs\" won all those Oscars and Cornwell decided she wanted a piece of the serial killer pie.

I also read extensively in the mystery/suspense genre. So I feel entitled to express an opinion as to her work.I don't know what happen to her writing, perhaps it was her early tremendous success or the pressures of celebrity. But every book since Body Farm has been less and less enjoyable and worse - less readable. Her last three books I have had to force myself to finish. It has been borderline painful to read after seeing her brilliant writing from earlier novels. Knowing that she basically invented the police procedural genre with her early books;it has been disappointing and sad to witness her slide into the abyss. It is also troubling the this book will likely end up on bestseller lists.Fiction is about character. If you've read the series then you know that all of her characters have gone from capivating, interesting, and indepth to shallow, self-indulgent, and pathetic charactures of what they once were.It's interesting that most all reviewers agree with the poor quailty of this book except for a few 5 star reviewers with one or two sentence reviews. I suspect these are ringers. If they think this is a 5 star book they didn't read the book I read.I have been picking up every PC book for the last five years hoping that she will return to the quality of her early work only to be sadly disappointed every time.If you must read this book (which I wouldn't recommend) - go to the library and check it out you\"ll be glad you did.I would suggest reading Post Mortem, All that Remains, Potters Field, Body Farm and I have heard Kathy Riechs is a good alternative.",

Even if the plot is weak, I can deal with it if it's first person. But, alas, with Trace and with Predator, Cornwell's 3rd person presentation doesn't draw me in at all.

After being a huge fan of the series for so long it is sad for me to say goodbye, but buying these books is truly a waste of money.

I have read many things as a mid thirties male and I never recall that I ever had any interest in reading a romantic novel. However, after purchasing a new kindle, I looked for both top selling paid and free books and this book was one of the top free ebooks avaialble from Amazon.com. I browsed through the description and thought, you know, this might be interesting. As a guy, I have long held an interest in news and communications and most guys will tell you they are addicted to the news and the media, so perhaps this might be a good match as the story was centered around a newscaster. After a quick download, I was really taken aback at how easy it was to connect with Diana's characters and how expertly done the character development was. By the end of the novel, you could really relate to Natalie and her struggles and as a guy, I could really relate to the massive conflict in Geoff's life.One thing that is nice about Diana's writing style is that there are just enough details to paint a good picture of the scenes and the surroundings without being too verbose. This makes the pacing fun and fast and doesn't really drag down or slow the tempo of the story at all. Some authors go off the deep end with the details and that can really bog a story down.Falling Star has been one of the more entertaining novels I have read in a long time. Although I prefer miltary and espionage novels mostly, it was nice to read something fun and this book is not just another romantic novel. Its a crazy thrill ride that makes you hanging on for the next crazy development. I have to say that once I started to read Falling Star, I couldn't put it down and after I finished, I purchased all of Diana's books. I hope you will love this fun, thrilling, sexy and crazy story as much as I did and I look forward to more of Diana's works.",

All this plus some really poor proofreading made me give up on seriously reading it at less than 50% through: I skimmed through the rest to confirm that the whole thing unwinds just as I'd expected, and the main character didn't get remotely more likeable.There are often typos in Kindle books, especially freebies, but it just added to the reasons not to carry on.

            {
                "review/text": "This was my first Stephanie Laurens book. Although I did like Ms. Lauren's clear writing style and evocative love scenes, I was a bit disappointed overall in both the story and the characters of the first of the Bastion Club Series, a premise I had high expectations about - seven bachelors negotiating the mine field of Regency London while looking for acceptable wives.Actually, my expectations of reading about this Bastion Club provided my first disappointment. Something that I had looked forward to was the interaction between these seven gentlemen sworn to help each other in their individual quests to find wives, yet this episode's hero, Tristan Weymiss, never involved the Bastion Club in his pursuit of the strangely reluctant Leonora Carling. If not for the prologue where the entire situation was explained and set into motion, the Bastion Club and six of its seven members would have been completely ignored altogether.The story, in a nutshell, involves Tristan Weymess, Earl of Trentham, who meets his lovely next door neighbor, Miss Leonora Carling, and finds himself drawn into the job of solving the riddle of mysterious burglaries that Leonora and her family have been experiencing. Naturally he finds himself attracted to the self-made spinster Leonora, who returns his attraction; indeed, enough so that she determines to seduce Tristan, or rather, allow him to seduce her. However, once the two lovers have consummated their relationship, Leonora strangely refuses Tristan's request for marriage, and he becomes the pursuer as she tries vainly to run from the bond that's developed between them.Sadly, I found neither the hero or heroine to be very interesting. Leonora was supposed to be this independent women, yet nothing except her small attempts to solve the mystery herself showed me why this was to be so. She set out to seduce Tristan, and once she'd accomplished this goal, turned into a completely different character; cold, distant and spurning his pursuit to marry her.As for Tristan, he simply did not stand out as a hero to take one's breath away. We are told on several occasions of the \"possessiveness\" he feels toward Leonora, but I never quite felt such to be the case. Except for his obvious fury after she is attacked, he really takes no steps that prove to me he has such a protective instinct. We learn very little about his inner workings, and he comes off as rather generic.I felt as if this were actually two different books pieced into one. The beginning and ending appeared to be about an independent, somewhat reclusive spinster and the straightforward war hero who attempts to help her solve a mysterious burglary, seducing her in the meantime. Then, after finally making it into the bedroom, the two take their cat and mouse game into the ballrooms of the ton, and Leonora seems to become a completely different type of woman. A good portion of the book focuses on her refusal to marry Tristan for reasons that I expected to be sound and perhaps even shocking, only to discover are as bland as the character of Leonora herself.Which leads me to Leonora's reluctance. For a woman bent on not marrying this nearly perfect man, her reasons, once explained, proved to me far too flimsy and transparent. Apparently, the death of her parents left her with the inability to trust or rely on anyone, and for that reason she felt unwilling to place her trust in a husband. However, nowhere in the story was any inkling given that the death of her parents had caused her undue distress, and once she internally admitted this reluctance to herself, the problem seemed to disappear. I felt like Leonora's refusal to marry was a very thin conflict set up to keep these two lovers apart when really there was no other reason at all.The seduction of Leonora was done quite well if not somewhat formulaicly, with each interaction between the two would-be lovers jumping a carefully-measured fraction until the ultimate consummation. I liked that Leonora didn't play the coy virgin but rather admitted to her attraction and her desire to have Tristan \"initiate\" her into the pleasures between a man and a woman. Once she gave into his deal to prove that the attraction between them would not diminish but only increase, she very unashamedly enjoyed the physical aspect of their relationship.The a-plot, or mystery about the burglaries, held no appeal to me whatsoever. Indeed, I found myself skimming the longer passages that dealt with this completely uncompelling plot which didn't even provide reason enough to inspire the supposed \"possessiveness\" Tristan felt for Leonora. I didn't care at all who was burglarizing Leonora's home and felt no compulsion for the mystery to be solved. Like Leonora's inner struggle with trust, the mystery felt more like an invented story crutch to throw these two together in the first place. I wondered quite frequently why there were no police officers involved in solving these attempted crimes.I'm sad that I didn't like this book better because I don't know that I'll continue with the Bastion Club series. Maybe I need to try one of the Cynster books instead.",

He has been working as a spy during the wars and isn't used to needing/wanting someone else in his life. But he appreciates, cherishes, and respects Leonora.Leonora Carling, the girl next door literally, is a strong female who knows her worth and what she really wants out of life. Her intelligence keeps her even with Tristian. A trait that he admires.The development of their relationship is steady and complete. You can see it evolving into a realistic thing.

This &quot;partnership&quot; works at solving the mystery of why someone wants in Leonora's her house.Devil Cynster (Devil's Bride) even makes a quick appearance in this book.

She is a very talented author and well worth reading. This is just not one of her better stories.",

                "review/text": "I normally really enjoy Ms. Laurens' books, but this one was lacking in several ways:1) The premise is not credible. I can't really understand what all these men's beef is about, much less believe that they would form a group, buy a house, and refit the house just so that they could have their little club. It sounds somewhat kindergarten-ish.2) Leonora is as dull as they come. I couldn't find a thing about this woman (aside from her being 26) attractive enough to capture Tristan's attention, much less make him decide to marry her before he has even met her. Actually, that does make sense. He'd already decided to marry her before making her acquaintance, and even though he found out how incredibly boring she is, he was too stubborn to change his mind.3) Tristan is too vague of a character to fall for. He didn't really do it for me. No strong opinions. No witty dialogue. No outstanding characteristics. Now his relationship with Leonora makes even more sense: he found her as boring as she found him, and together they decided to living in a big, boring house and have little, boring babies.and 4) The story takes forever to develop. Leonora and Tristan dither around lots and lots before anything interesting happens. If you like people making social calls, this is the book for you.This book won't stop me from buying Ms. Laurens' books; however, I do hope the next story of the series gets better or I'll just have to wait the whole thing out.",

Instead of a steady build up of sexual tension as is her wont, the characters in this novel were devoid of any charm or sensuality. I didn't feel in the least bit interested in either of the main characters, I found their relationship unrealistic and boring and the story wound around their relationship just as boring. The excuse given for the lady not wanting to get married (to a rich, handsome, fascinating earl) was just pathetic. I usually finish her novels in one sitting: this one I put down so often, I debated returning to it but eventually finished it only out of respect for SL.The formula was so predictable, the language likewise. It was as if someone else - Ms Lauren's editor or assistant - wrote the book in the style of her other books but completely missed out on what makes SL so exciting. No tension, no sensuality, no steamy sex, predictable and so boring. Truly a waste of time.Oh Stephanie, please inject your old magic in future books. I'll try the next one, of course, but if that is of a similar vein, I'm giving up.",

                "review/text": "although it is hardly Laurens' best. No, my major problem with this book is Lauren's recent style affectations. For some inexplicable reason, Laurens has decided that fragments are infinitely better than complete sentences, and so she writes in fragments to the extent that it is often difficult to follow her train of thought. Then she tops it off with a multitude of one-sentence paragraphs. Take these examples:&quot;Couldn't turn away.The connections slowly clarified in her mind.Tristan, she knew, wouldn't turn her away. Wouldn't refuse her.With him, she'd be safe.&quot;(elementary stuff, that.) OR&quot;She was where she belonged. In his arms. With love between them.&quot; (gak!)And those are some that actually make sense. In addition, Laurens has developed the habit of reusing and overusing pet words and phrases. The words and their attendant emotions lose their impact and often become downright silly.Tristan and Leonora are a nice couple, fairly well drawn, especially Leonora, even though I hated that she broke her promise to him. (Yeah, she explains it away as meaning something else, but I didn't buy it.) I'm still not sure how Tristan is different from the rest of the Bastion Club members; they all seemed of a piece in this book. Frankly the setting up of the club is rather boring.The artist's rendering of Tristan is totally yummy, but the story lacked due to the pitfalls of Laurens' adopted style and her penchant for overly-detailed, almost clinical love scenes. This book pushes Laurens, once a favorite, farther down the list of authors to read...she's nowhere near the top now. If you want to read it, borrow it; don't waste your money.",

I knew that this wasn't going well when I kept thinking, \"oh, I should go to sleep\" and when I looked at the clock, I realized it was an hour before my bedtime!The plot is ho-hum and the main characters are quite annoying. Well, Leanora is annoying -- Tristian is not well sketched enough to be annoying. He's just \"blah\". I had no interest in the two of them getting together - and, frankly, there was no reason for them NOT to get together. The only conflict in the book was the break-ins taking place in their neighborhood and that plot was not compelling at all.There were certain things I didn't understand -- Leonara just casually walks everywhere by herself, without a chaperone and justifies it by saying she is 26. Well, I'm not history expert but I don't think that the rules were lax on older women back then - most novels set in that period state that only widowed women were allowed freedom to travel without chaperones - and even then it was frowned upon.The mystery is so-so and not very engrossing - in fact it just detracts from the Tristian/Leanora story. The book is also way too long -- I found myself skimming through pages of dialogue about the mystery, etc.The reason I have to give it 2 stars is because I did actually finish the book (which I cannot say for all books) and because I enjoyed the premise - 7 men coming back from war and thinking that the Ton is worse than Waterloo.I will probably may try to read at least one more \"Bastion Club\" book, but only because I can get them all from my library.

                "review/text": "Paul Wollf, Emerson's newest protagonist, is another superlative example of a deeply flawed individual who wins the reader's sympathy despite some character traits which, if Wolff were a real person, would make a sane person keep him at the proverbial barge pole's distance. But make no mistake, Emerson has not recreated his previous hero, Swope, in Wollf. Where Swope was a mindless womanizer, Wollf is a shy guy who knows he's not good enough for a good woman. Where Swope was a popular guy around the firehouse, Wollf holds the entire world at bay, his sternly leashed violence like a guard dog between him and his fellow creatures. But as in \"Into the Inferno\" Emerson does tell a thumping good action yarn all the while interlacing it with the hero's movement towards self-discovery. If Swope was the guy you hoped would be taking you home after the party, then Wollf is the guy you hope you're waking up with on a quiet Sunday morning.As always, Emerson's well-honed descriptions and his ear for dialogue boost a story that in less gifted hands might end up merely workmanlike. Example: \"I suck dark smoke all the way up. It tastes like the undercarriage of a fertilizer truck might.\" What an image! Makes me want a swig of Listerine bad!Another plus for this author -- and some may disagree with me on this, but so what? They'll be wrong! -- is that he is so NOT afraid to stretch his skills, I mean really work at his craft, and the proof is in how he told this story from so many different points of view and still made the story cohesive and kept the flow of events and emotions constant. That can't have been easy, and it had to have been a conscious choice right from the beginning of the book.I wish I wasn't going to have to wait another year or more for the next book by Earl Emerson. And I wish he'd do another book tour through the Midwest sometime! Why does the left coast get all the breaks?Thanks, too, Mr. Emerson, for the opening quote from Elmer Slezak. I miss him!",

But it's grown on me a bit over the last two days...Lt. Paul Wollf is a firefighter in Seattle, and he can best be described as an excellent firefighter with anger and impulse management control issues. His father was also a firefighter and died in a fire that was set by a serial arsonist. The arsonist appears to be back after a 25 year absence, and Wollf is trying to figure out whether its the same guy who killed his father and now seems to want him dead. After his father died when he was young, his mom went to pieces, living with a number of lowlifes. One killed his mom, and his brother and him killed the killer. Due to bad representation, his brother ended up serving time for that murder, and that led to his anger issues. The two story lines blend together at the end when the arsonist and Wollf come face to face and he learns some truths he didn't realize.The novel seems rather dark, and Wolff's fellow firefighters (especially his bosses) are all pretty dysfunctional. Some of the leadership behavior is so bad, I kept thinking 1) why?, and 2) this wouldn't be allowed to continue. As the book progresses, you start to understand some of the tension and interplay between Wollf and the bosses that causes all the conflict. I guess I didn't think much of it to start as I was expecting more action. But when I thought back on the characters and the interplay between them, I realized the book was a bit deeper than I originally gave it credit for.",

And after a lengthy, successful detective series, he's turned to what he knows and has set his last several novels in the firefighter milieu.I was pleasantly surprised by his Thomas Black private eye novels, mainly because I grew to like the characters so much. Even so, I've found his books to be frustrating reads. They tend to be full of hyper-quirky characters that do and say things that have absolutely no bearing on either story or plot (or what anyone would really do in a similar situation, for that matter).This is the first of his firefighter novels I've read. And I can't get into it at all, for a lot of the same reasons.Emerson should know his stuff. Here, everything seems right; the accuracy is all there from a technical standpoint, and who better to write about firefighting than a real life firefighter. But this is the deal: you can feel Emerson hiding behind the writing, working hard to craft his twisty-turny plots and his goofy characters. With Pyro, he splits the narrative into (so far) seemingly half a dozen different points of view, which completely distracts from the flow of the book.

                "review/text": "As exciting as a police procedural, this novel is, instead, a \"fireman's procedural,\" tracing the story of a fire lieutenant's death twenty-five years ago in an arson fire, the failed hunt for the pyromaniac who set it, and the \"pyro's\" possible return to action in Seattle during a spate of recent arsons. Twenty-nine-year-old Paul Wollf is the son of this lieutenant, who died when Wollf was only four, an event which destroyed his childhood. His mother, unable to cope, descended into depression and alcoholism and neglected the children. Six years later, they witnessed her murder by their stepfather, who was then murdered himself. When a string of recent arsons keeps the station busy all night for several nights in a row, Wolff notices an odd \"signature\" to the fires, the same \"signature\" that appeared at the fire that killed his father twenty-five years ago.Determined to avenge his father's death, Wollf is often stymied by jealousies and bureaucracy within his own department. An angry man who has never been able to form close relationships, perhaps due to his traumatic past, Wollf has no one in whom he can confide. When his favorite film star of the past, the elderly Patricia Pennington, is the victim of one of these new fires, Wollf meets both her granddaughter and housekeeper, two women of markedly different temperaments, both of whom play key roles in the events which follow.A probationary firefighter, a stationhouse veteran, Patricia Pennington's granddaughter, Wollf, and the \"pyro\" himself all tell the story in first-person accounts, broadening the focus and casting new light on Wollf, the inner workings of the fire department, and the madness of pyromania. Acutely psychological and intense in the search for the \"pyro,\" the novel also sheds light on some of the reasons firemen are drawn to the job and the games some are willing to play in order acquire power.For author Earl Emerson, himself a lieutenant in the Seattle Fire Department, realism is critical. Technical aspects of fighting fires, venting roofs, using fans to drive out smoke, handling ladders, and saving lives are fascinating, fully described, and completely integrated into this exciting story. The complexities of bureaucracy, the reality of public relations and publicity, and the difficulties of managing personal relationships are also part of the realism. A fast-paced action novel filled with dramatic fire-fighting scenes, the novel is a tribute to the heroic men and women who risk their lives daily. Mary Whipple",

No over the top drama for this reader, only a pitch perfect, authentic performance.Reece Gilmore is literally hanging on with her fingernails. She witnessed brutal killings in the Boston diner where she worked and was wounded herself. Realizing the state she was in she sought help as a patient in a psychiatric hospital. Eventually, she felt well enough to leave and our story takes place primarily in Angel's Fist, Wyoming where she has sought peace and hopefully a stabilized mental condition, free of nightmares and panic attacks.Once settled in, she hikes up into the mountains and surveys the beautiful surroundings with her binoculars. What she sees is not beautiful at all - it is a couple struggling on the opposite bank of the Snake River. The man has the woman in a stranglehold, and Reece is sure he is killing her.However, once she reaches another person on the trail, Brody, and asks for help, they return to the scene she described and find absolutely nothing.

It's not more of the same, though, because the people of Angel's Fist, Wyoming have a much different flavor than the residents of Lunacy, Alaska, and the places themselves are not much alike.Reece Gilmore is the sole survivor of a murder spree in a restaurant in Boston, where she had been a chef. After months of therapy and hospitalization, Reece is trying to put herself back together. She's meandering across the country in her old car, stopping from time to time to work long enough to make enough money to move on. Afraid of the dark and obsessive about locking doors, Reece limps into Angel's Fist with her car overheating. Seeing a sign in a diner window, the cordon bleu chef takes a job as a fry cook and, eventually, rents an apartment above the diner and starts settling in. One day while out hiking, she stops to rest in a scenic spot overlooking the Snake River and spies a couple in her binoculars. When their argument erupts into murder, Reece runs down the trail and into Brody, a thriller writer who lives in Angel's Fist. They report the murder and direct the police to the place where it happened, but no trace of an altercation is found.On the heels of that incident, strange things start to happen in Reece's apartment. Things are put in the wrong place and once she even finds her front door unlocked and open. At first, Reece believes she's having memory lapses, but as the bizarre happenings escalate, she and Brody start to believe the killer is messing with her head. With no victim and no trace of a crime, most of Angel's Fist believes Reece is losing it, but she is convinced that a very real killer is on the loose. In between the intrigue, Reece and Brody start having a hot affair, so nobody takes the fact that he believes Reece too seriously.I figured out exactly what happened as soon as it happened, the reasons why, and who the guilty party was. The only thing left was waiting to see if I was right, which I was. Still, I doubted myself a couple of times.The pace of this book is on the slow side for Nora Roberts, but never boring. There was always something happening to keep the story moving. Reece was obsessive and jittery, but not frail or clingy. Brody was all personality and I never really got a good picture of him in my head. Though not the most compelling or gripping book in the Roberts collection, it is nonetheless a good sample of her work. Nora has the ability to weave good stories with a different cast and at varying paces, and still make us keep turning the pages every time. Even meandering along, Angels Fall is another compelling tale by a powerhouse writer.",

Consider the following:(1) One can flip through the pages of any unread Nora Roberts book and come to the first sizzling sex scene without any difficulty. This scene is exactly the same place, every time--on rails. While I find this concrete formula annoying, apparently it works for most readers. Roberts sells more books than almost anyone and is on Time's list of the 100 most influential people. The somewhat campy descriptions of bedroom bombastics notwithstanding. I just wish she'd vary the placement and the language a little. Make that a whole lot.(2) The heroine of \"Angels Fall\" is flummoxed by malicious tricks played on her, often within her apartment over the diner while she is away. These tricks happen over and over again, without anyone setting a simple trap for the perp. Of course, that would make the book a lot shorter. No one even puts scotch tape on the door, flour on the floor, a bear trap, someome to watch the stairs, etc. The characters aren't dumb. The hero is a best selling mystery writer. But no one thinks to take precautions of any sort. In addition, there are just too many of these malicious tricks, presumably to fill out the pages.(3) Lastly, there oughtta be a law against the villain holding a gun on his victims and explaining in fine detail (several pages) just what he did and how. If I were the villain and had my pursuers in the crosshairs, I'd zap them right now and get the heck out of there. And so would any self-respecting villain with an ounce of sense. This old, stale device should be retired forever. The denouement of \"Angels Fall\" would have been much more effective without the explanations. Readers are capable of filling in a few blanks.So why did I give this three stars? Just for the atmosphere, for the Tetons, for the town, the lake, the diner, the townspeople, the food. No one is better than Nora Roberts at creating the background for a novel. I just wish she'd get serious about the plots and become a novelist who would be remembered.",

Throughout the town, the only person who believes her is the rugged and reclusive mystery novelist, Brody. For his part, Brody is certain that his interest in Reece comes entirely from her mysterious background, yet finds himself unable to keep from staring at her.The romance was a slow-starter, yet very believable and ultimately satisfying. Roberts ably portrays a woman still recovering both physically and emotionally. Her courage in rebuilding a life made Reece both an inspiring and sympathetic character.However it was the mystery aspect of this novel which for me created the greatest delight in reading. Seen through her eyes, Reece's paranoia helped heighten my own suspense.As far as the writing itself, Nora Roberts once again has proven herself to be a master with words. The locals of Angel's Fist are well-crafted, lending a small-town family reunion feel to the plot, not to mention their own delightful stories.If you're looking for a thought-provoking mystery that just happens to include a believable romance then I highly recommend this book.

If you liked that one, you will definitely like this one too.

The central mystery--rarely her best point outside of the J.D. Robb books anymore--is decent enough to keep you turning the pages. But here, without the mysticism I have found so annoying in her recent trilogies, she tells the story of a woman coming back from a trauma in a believable way. Her dialogue and characterization is the best there is in the romantic suspense genre. I'm not disappointed that I bought this one in hardback.",

I usually love them and read them over and over. I have read all of her books and I can say that this was by far the worst. The only reason I rated it two stars was that it did have a good plot. I don't know about anyone else, but I have to relate or at least understand the interaction between the two main characters. I liked her character and could really relate. However, I really didn't like his. I couldn't relate to the relationship that they shared. She panics and he tells her that hysterical women make him angry. She wakes up from a nightmare swinging and he tells her that if she hits him he'll hit back. Yet she falls in love with him saying that the way he treats her is what works. By the time I got halfway through the book I was skimming and couldn't care less if they ever cought the bad guy. I usually love any book written by her and was very much looking forward to this one. It does have a really good story line. It just didn't have that special quality that Nora Roberts usually delivers. This is the first book by her that I am returning.",

However, her recent novels, Northern Lights, the Garden Trilogy, The Key Trilogy and, the latest, Angle's Fall have been a string of disappointments for me. You can almost feel a level of laziness creeping up in the writing, character building and even the story telling. I can't get any character in those novels feel the ways they feel. Almost every single one of them, with very few exceptions, are devoid of emotions. There's hardly any chemistry between the leading characters. The author ham-fisted put them together for no apparent reason other than out of convenience. The romance parts of Nora's books are certainly diminishing rapidly. However, I do give her credit for taking an inter-journey of self-discovery, especially after traumatic experiences, such as Reece's narrow escape from the death and Nat's (in Northern Lights) depression. But if you are looking for a romance novel and hoping to repeat the experience of reading her earlier great books, such as Genuine Lies, Honest Illusions etc, you are in for a huge disappointment. It is time to discover the next excellent romance writer. I wish all her loyal fans, me included, can speak up and stop her factory-assembly-type of rapid book release. Nora, please concentrate on writing fewer but better books, for the sake of your fans, rather than focusing on the dollar signs. If you continue this self-destruction trajectory, soon, your fans will leave you one by one.",

If you want a great new book for your vacation, get Angels Fall!If you have ever been to Wyoming, you probably came away in awe of the Tetons. Seeing those peaks is in some ways even more moving than the Grand Canyon. And on a hot day in July, it's nice to think about being in Wyoming. The Tetons are a primary spiritual character in this book, helping to inspire the fictional characters to take the right steps.A fragile woman, Reece Gilmore, finds herself stuck in Angel's Fist, Wyoming (not too far from Jackson Hole) after he radiator hose splits. Needing to make a few bucks, she impulsively applies for the cook's job at short-order Angel Food. Clearly, she knows what she's doing. While most people would freak out from the pressure, it's almost a relief to Reece, as it takes her minds off other issues.Gradually, we learn that Reece is on the roam to try to erase very unhappy memories. I won't say more because Ms. Roberts does a nice job of letting the details emerge in the novel.Meeting the people in Angels Fist soon makes Reece think that she might like to stay . . . except for one problem: Reece observes a murder while on her first hike. But no one can find a body . . . or signs of a murder. Is Reece crazy?The incident does have one positive element, it brings Reece into close contact with Jamsion P. Brody (who prefers to be called Brody), a mystery novelist whose posterior is causing much conversation among the younger women in town. Their relationship blossoms in unexpected ways . . . both for the reader and for them.The issue of Reece's sanity becomes clouded by lots of incidents where the unexpected happens. But as Reece points out in the book, \"It's not paranoia if they're really after you.\"The novel is filled with delightful characters you'll long remember . . . and may wish to meet:Joanie: She owns Angel Food and likes to talk tough . . . but may be a little bit softer than that.Lo: Joanie's son whose nickname is short for \"Lothario\" and who has plans for Reece.Linda-gail: The waitress who wants Lo . . . as a faithful husband.Mac: Loves to help people.Rick: The local sheriff who finds himself unwilling to place too much credence in the views of a newcomer, but has a delightful family.The mystery story is well done. You'll probably be thinking it's one of four characters right up until the last few pages.The most delightful aspect of this well-written story is that Ms. Roberts doesn't rush her story, her characters or your pleasure in enjoying the book. Although I'm far from a big foodie, I loved the many interesting food references in the book. It's like the Goldy Schultz stories in a way . . . but without the recipes. Like Goldy, Reece communicates through food.Read this book and enjoy yourself! It won't hurt to have a nice glass of wine and some tasty snacks nearby while you do.",

                "review/text": "I bought \"The Bourne identity\" mostly because I didn't want to lose the opportunity of reading Ludlum's book before the release of a film based on it. I really wasn't a fan of the author (and I am not one now), but I loved this book.To start with, the plot is remarkably good. \"The Bourne identity\" is the story of a man without a past, rescued from the Mediterranean Sea by some fishermen. He is very ill, and his body has suffered the impact of many bullets. The man is taken by the fishermen to a doctor in a nearby island, who helps him to recover physically and mentally. Our protagonist doesn't remember who he is, but with the help of the doctor he finds some clues he doesn't like too much. He only knows for certain some things, for instance that his face has been altered by plastic surgery, that he knows a lot about firearms and that he carried on him a microfilm that contains the code to an account of four million dollars.In the Swiss bank where the account is he also finds a name: Jason Bourne. But... is he Jason Bourne?. He cannot remember, and if it were for quite a few people, he won't. From the moment he leaves the island onwards, our man without a past will be followed, and attacked. He doesn't understand why, but he reacts in order to stay alive. Add to this already interesting mixture a woman he takes as a hostage, Marie, a number of assasins (including the most famous assassin in the world, Carlos), and the possibility that he is, as a matter of fact, also an assassin, and you will understand why this book is so good. The main character will be hunted all throughout the book not only by the \"bad guys\", but also by the \"good\" ones (mainly agents from the USA Government). You won't be able to stop reading this book, and you will find yourself asking aloud to nobody in particular \"who on earth is this man?\" and \"what started this whole mess\"?.All in all, I highly recommend this book to those who appreciate a good thriller, and to those who don't usually read this kind of book but are open to new experiences. I belong to the last category, as I only read \"The Bourne identity\" because I was interested in watching the movie of the same name.By the way, I also recommend the movie (the 2002 version, with Matt Damon), that ended up bearing only a limited resemblance to the book. If I had to choose, I would choose the book without hesitation, but if you have the possibility not only of reading the book but also of watching the movie, do both things... You won't regret it, and you will probably have fun trying to compare the movie to the book !!Belen Alcat",

                "review/text": "I promised I'd read The Bourne Identity after having seen the trailer starring Matt Damon in next year's movie by the same name. When I realized that Robert Ludlum had written the original book in 1980, I went to the library to pick up a copy. There's a similarity between the leading characters in Robert Ludlum's books. They're usually male, headstrong (and ultimately always the good guy), determined and they fall for a girl that complements the guy in some way.A couple of persnickety points I have to mention in my reviews(as always): I found it irritating the way Marie St. Jacques (the leading lady) speaks to Jason Bourne. She uses &quot;Darling&quot; a lot and her speech seems somewhat formal and affected. The author also uses italics to indicate what's going on in a character's mind from time to time. The recurring themes in this book are: be a sponge (because you've got amnesia), move! (because you're being hunted), don't kill if you don't have to (because deep down you're actually a good guy - a govt. guy). But sometimes, it just feels redundant and tedious to read. The first Ludlum book I've read is the recent bestseller The Sigma Protocol. I rated and reviewed that book on Amazon as well. In my review I ended by saying the author got preachy towards the end to do some last minute plot explanation before ending the book. I see a slight hint of that in this book as well.Some good points to consider are: It is my opinion that the author makes improvements to the style and tone of the sequel to this book called The Bourne Supremacy (which I liked better). I found it more action packed and rythmic. (The fact that I had spent most of my childhood summers in Hong Kong also helped.) I also enjoy his usage of local dialect interspersed in the characters' speech to give color and that authentic feel to the characters in his books. (Turns out he's been using this technique for the past 20+ years. You still see it in his latest novel The Sigma Protocol.)If I had to give a more precise rating for this book, I'd rate it a 4.5. I'm saving the higher ration of 5.0 for The Bourne Supremacy, which I'll write a review for next. Stay tuned.",

Always interested in plot lines that throw unsuspecting characters into the path of intrigue &amp; danger, Ludlum takes the concept to new heights in this novel. Not only does the character not know what is going on, he doesn't even know who he is! What he does know is that he's a dead man if he doesn't figure it all out pretty soon. The first paragraph of this novel may be the most exciting opening lines of any story ever written, and Ludlum's pacing and style were never better. I often get bored with spy novels (LeCarre wears me out) because the characters are slow and stupid. Ludlum's protagonist (Jason Bourne) is tough, smart, and clever, but very realistic. He does not make stupid mistakes (as any believable spy would not), but when hit or shot, he suffers as much as any of us would. If you fancy yourself a lover of spy mysteries, you must read this book! It is the only such book I have ever truly found to be a &quot;page-turner&quot;.

The hero agonizing over what his identity might be gets to be tedious and the love story is awkward as in all of his books. But, mostly the book moved at a good enough pace to make me want to read more.This is the first book in a three part series. I didn't know that when I read the book, and was frustrated and disappointed as I neared the end of the book and realized the story wouldn't be concluded. The second book in the series (Bourne Supremacy) is pretty bad and doesn't really build on the first book. It isn't necessary to read it before jumping on to the third book (Bourne Ultimatum) and the conclusion of the story. The third book isn't as good as the first, but is worth reading for the conclusion.",

                "review/text": "Like many people I came to this book through the movies based on Robert Ludlum's Bourne novels. I read THE JANSON DIRECTIVE several years ago (blew through it on a 30-hour train ride between Kolkata and Chennai), and though it was entertaining enough to pass the time with, I felt like it was essentially literary packing foam. I wasn't looking for Les Miserables, mind you, but Ludlum's characters are pretty mechanical, operating basically to show off a hidden world of espionage, conspiracy, and cool gadgets. There's nothing essentially wrong with this kind of novel, but I prefer character-driven fiction, where I can see personalities of some complexity and depth grapple with challenges and come out changed somehow. As far as I can tell, Ludlum didn't write this kind of novel often.But THE BOURNE IDENTITY is an attempt at this kind of novel. The main character, so-called \"Jason Bourne,\" is not struggling against assassins and CIA operatives for some political agenda or even merely to save his own life. He is trying to understand himself, to learn who he is. As one character states (as an almost shameless declaration of the \"moral of the story\"), \"In a way, [Bourne is] a functioning microcosm of us all. I mean, we're all trying to find out who the hell we are, aren't we?\" Such internal conflict, however, is handled quite clumsily in Ludlum's hands, which seem unaccustomed to dealing with emotional subtleties. Credit should go to the makers of the Bourne movies (Matt Damon and the rest of the cast prominent among them) for breathing life and depth into these characters.I was a bit disappointed at how much of the mysteries surrounding Bourne's character are resolved for the reader not through Bourne himself learning the truth, but through a significant number of scenes where Bourne's adversaries discuss the details of his past life amongst themselves. For me this sucked the momentum out of the winding up scenes, and left me feeling like I'd missed the climax.One last thing: those picking up THE BOURNE IDENTITY having seen the movies should be aware that the novel was published in 1980. While many of the basic premises remain the same, this is not exactly the same story you saw on screen. This is not at all a bad thing, but some people get really upset when they're expecting a perfect translation between literature and film or vice versa.",

True. Every 10 to 20 pages is yet another plot twist. At well over 500 pages, that's a few too many.I really tried to like this novel. I enjoy mystery novels and really liked the film Bourne Identity, so I figured I would enjoy this book. Well, it was enjoyable, certainly in the first third, but after a while, it dragged on to an awkward conclusion. This book is jam-packed with plot turns, new character introductions, and lots of repetitive inner-monologue.I was really shocked. With Ludlum's reputation, I really expected a tight thriller. It was anything but. I grew tired of the yet-another-plot-device about 150 pages before the conclusion. Which for me, was the worst part...The ending is very unfulfilling. The books leads up to a climax, yet... well, I won't ruin it for you, in case you decide to see for yourself. I'll just say this - GIGANTIC loose ends (one almost impossible to believe), which left me wanting. So...I picked up Bourne Supremacy to see if Ludlum begins to tie the loose ends up. After all, I am aware this is the Bourne Trilogy. But... nope. Bourne Supremecy - brand new plot, without trying to clear up the unanswered questions of the first book. I had to stop reading that book for fear of more unfulfilled plot promises.It reminded me of the sprawling plot twists in the endless X-Files series, which ultimately petered out without conclusion. With so much invested, in this case 535 pages, you've got to give me an ending. Jeez.The movie, it should be stated, is very different, tossing the entire (main) Carlos-the-Assassin plot, for a very tight, streamlined film that BARELY resembles this book. Which is good for the movie. I haven't seen Supremacy, so I have no comment, but I've heard from friends that it strays even farther from the novels.Wait... The movie is BETTER than the book?! Yep.

It seemed to have potential at the start, but it quickly died when the pace of the book quickened to the lead character constantly dodging would-be killers. And there were a lot of them. My skepticism turned to disbelief when Bourne kidnaps a female to aid in his escape from even more people that are trying to kill him. After threatening her life and inflicting pain on her mulitple times to keep her near, he's essentially turned her life upside down and convinced her she might die. So how does she respond? She falls in love with him. Not sure if I've ever witnessed a quicker transition from total hatred for your potential killer to unconditional love (openly professing their love for each other on a routine basis). In a matter of about 70 pages she goes from being utterly terrified of him and turning him into the police (or who she thinks is the police) to this: \"I should throw you out,\" he said. \"I should tell you to get out of my life.\" She replies: \"It wouldn't make any difference if you did. I wouldn't go, my love.\" Yeah, that's believable.This book suffered because of Ludlums strange priorities. When the book was fast paced, it was also quite shallow and superficial, barely holding my interest. When the book focused more what should have been the interesting parts, it slowed down considerably, barely holding my interest. And there is Ludlums thing with printing snippets of other languages. Not a bad thing if you know what he's talking about. But he did it with both German (which I speak) and French (lots and lots of French, which I don't speak) and it just left you confused and bored.This was my second and last book by Ludlum.

The book opens with Jason Bourne taking a bullet in the head on a boat in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. He is rescued from the stormy waters by a group of fishermen who take him to the local doctor. The doctor repairs our man's wounds and nurses him back to health. When Bourne is finally awakes from his comma, he discovers that he doesn't remember a thing, not even his name. The doctor starts Bourne on his journey with a piece of microfilm with a Swiss bank account number on it, and the realization that Bourne's features have been changed recently by surgery and that he speaks three languages. We also find out that Bourne is deadly in the arts of hand-to-hand combat. If this isn't enough to get you reading, it's time to find a different genre of books to pursue.Ludlum is a strong writer in the action, deception, and overall plot sense. Unfortunately, he is terrible at character interactions. The female character, Marie St. Jacques, and Bourne feel as if they were forced together by the author because it was the only way the story would work. There is very little tension between the two of them, even when she was with him against her will. She is also entirely too bright, able to guess many of the things from Bourne's past. I think Ludlum was concerned that his audience might lose their way, and Marie was there to give them the inside scoop. My only other complaint about the book is Bourne's ability to attract bullets. He has more holes in him than most cheeses.The plot is good. There are several areas were it is a little weak, but the momentum of the book carries you through these areas before you realize that there is something wrong with it. This is a very good action thriller that will keep you reading well past your bedtime. Ludlum let's on Bourne's past in such a way that you keep reading to find out more about him. The Bourne character is fairly well developed, with quite a history behind him even though we only see it in brief glimpses. Bourne is a good problem solver and great manipulator. We learn a lot of Bourne's motivation even though we never quite understand what is behind the other characters' actions.This seems like it might have been originally a complete book, but someone got the idea that this could easily be turned into a series. Therefore, the ending isn't as strong as it could be, leaving obvious gaps to be answered in the subsequent books. This is one of the better books that I've read in a long while. I do recommend it.",

In the book's diegesis, the year is 1980 (there abouts) and there are none of these modern devices, allowing Bourne and his female companion more time to plan and to act. I also prefer Maria in the book because she actually has useful skills. In the film she is just there as a convenient ride away from the initial confrontation and later hangs onto Bourne out of Stockholm syndrome.

A) Ethan and his family deal with the third anniversary of his brother's kidnap and murder, B) the growing attraction between Ethan's sister-in-law, Bonnie and biker, bookstore owner, computer expert Singleton Cobb, C) Ethan looks into solving the old mystery of writer Walter Kirwan's death and missing manuscript, D) Grant Loring, Arcadia's husband, is trying to eliminate her, E) Zoe must deal with a person from her past, F) Can Zoe and Ethan make their marriage work?, G) Zoe has interior decorating competition in the form of Lindsey Voyle, H) Is Nelson Radnor's wife having an affair?This is just a little of what is happening in this very busy novel. The story is so busy that there is very little time for romance but the author does a good job weaving the story that you really don't notice it. Now that Ethan and Zoe are married, there is a different approach to the romantic segment of the book.The writing is fast-paced, easy to read and precise. All loose ends are tied up with a heartwarming finish except one tiny issue that dogged Ethan and Zoe throughout the book. You will have to read it to find out what it is.I was delighted with this very entertaining read. I would like to read more Whispering Springs novels in the future.",

It was Ethan and his baggage dragged around even longer and Zoe's insecurity over her marriage and husband making me cringe.I saw no reason for writing an entire book just to continue Ethan's and Zoe's story. I was expecting a new suspense plot but there wasn't. Arcadia's character was also inserted as if JAK happened to remember she was in the previous book and so merited a casual inclusion.This book was lacking in everything that had made JAK one of my favourite authors.

Instead, it's a muddled mishmash of characters who never gel on the page; instead of focusing on heroine and hero Zoe and Ethan, the author distracts with supporting characters that I couldn't have cared less for.Zoe's supposed to have big angst from her time in a psychiatric institute and her ability to literally read the walls of a house. Both could have been devices to ramp up the drama, but instead Krentz can't get a psychological grip on Zoe and winds up turning the character into a confused and lifeless cariacature. Ethan gets the same short shrift: what could have been a deep, dark and sexy character is instead insecure and disrespectful and not all that sexy.The mystery is so convoluted that there's no way for a reader to be engaged in solving it. The clues come and go, red herrings that don't make sense keep popping up and just when you think the story is moving along, bam - Krentz switches gears to one of the incredibly boring subplots involving the supporting characters.I hate it when authors push out books for the sake of having something on the shelves. Truth or Dare feels like Ms. Krentz's editor wanted a contemporary paranormal book (and a sequel to an existing book) of a certain kind and rushed this into print even though the author herself didn't have a cogent storyline for it. Every single aspect of it seems rushed and as if the author herself didn't care much how it came out; if she doesn't care, the reader won't either.",

As a suspense novel, it does a little better, but the ending drags it down considerably. The jury is still out on the intriguing subplots, because I seemed to have missed them completely.If you have enjoyed other books by this author, and are having a slow afternoon, maybe this book will serve to pass a few hours, but wouldn't be the best choice if you've got other stuff on your to-read list.

I haven't been this absorbed in a mystery since reading The Maltese Falcon as a kid. Coben has created unforgettable, quirky characters who engage us even more than the story does.Some other reviewers have suggested that The Final Detail was a bit stale. But, since it was my introduction to the series, it seemed fresh and new to me. The novel did stand pretty well on its own, but there were a few out-of-the-blue references to characters like Brenda Slaughter, who appeared in earlier stories, that were not put into context. On the other hand, these tantalizing unexplained references increased my desire to read the rest of the series. This time, I'll do it in sequence of publication.There are some electrifying characters in this series, particularly Win, the semi-psychotic playboy/money manager/intellectual. And Big Cyndi is both a hilarious and edgy creation.I would have given the book 5 stars had it not been for a couple of points. I thought the character of Thrill (Nancy) was completely unecessary, unless she's simply being introduced as a central character for a future installment. I felt that there too many women throwing themselves at Bolitar and that Bolitar's affection toward his parents got mawkish at times. I also felt that Esperanza is a convenient conglomeration of political correctness (Lesbian, Latina, professional woman, brainy beauty, assertive, etc. etc.) rather than a real flesh-and-blood character, at least in this installment.Overall, I feel this was a terrific mystery and that Coben is right up there with the greats of the genre.",

Hungry for more Coben, I went back to read some of his earlier work, picking up The Final Detail.While I found the book enjoyable to read, it is not as satisfying as his more recent books. The protagonist, sports agent Myron Bolitar, is a well-developed, sypmathetic character, and it is fun to follow him on his rather improbable adventures. But I found many of the other characters in the book to be more cartoonish and less believable. The biggest disappointment for me was the conclusion which smacked a bit of pulling a rabbit out of a hat. While it was a tidy conclusion, it was unsatisfying because the reader had no hints of what the outcome would be. Rather than \"Oh my! Of course that's what happened! Why didn't I see it!\" the reader is left scratching his head and wondering why Coben wrote a conclusion that did not flow logically from what had gone before.I am eagerly looking forward to reading Coben's next book (The Innocent), but doubt that I'll be reading any more of the Myron Bolitar books.",

While relaxing on the tropical beach for three weeks, his company goes to pieces, and his partner, Esperanza, is arrested for the murder of Myron's first ever client, major league relief pitcher, Clu Haid.Myron is rushed back into the limelight, as a potential suspect as well as an accessory. He is forced to scramble to keep his agency afloat, clear his best friend's name, and deal with his competition, which is run by the mafia. To make matters worse, Esperanza wants him to back off, something that Myron just can't do.All of the loveable characters are back, and fans of Big Cindi will really get to know her a lot better in this novel. A few new interesting characters are introduced as Myron travels through New York's sexual underground for answers.There are so many wicked plot twists, the book becomes a wild page-turner instantly. Coben's gifted writing talents shine through remarkably, and the character dialogue is perfectly snappy. The storyline is impressively complete and well-defined.

A formerly well known sports star who is making a come back, is found, apparently murdered, with clues found leading to the arrest of Myrons' partner.

As Myron learns about right and wrong, rarely is the delineation between the good guys and bad guys without a little fuzziness. They're all people doing the best they can given their particular circumstances. In the end, even Myron himself wonders if he's no longer one of the 'good guys.'So why only 4.5 stars?

Most Myron adventures are full of action and although there is a small amount in this novel this book is a more of a get to know a bit more about the lives and past of supporting characters which haven't been explored in great detail in previous novels such as Myron's dad, Esperanza, Big Cyndi and even Myron. Although Win is in this novel, he is really mostly a conversationalist in this one seeing very little action at all. Myron even decides Yoo-Hoo is no longer his favourite drink in this book. It is almost as if fans have demanded another Myron Sequel and Coben has run out of ideas so has just decided to release more information on the other characters with a basic plot to tie it together. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of the Bolitar series and have immensely enjoyed them all but I don't think this one is up there in quality, suspense or the other aspects that made those great.Whilst during the third quarter of the book you do experience the don't want to stop, can't put the book down experience, that does unfortunately die out and it certainly never was there before that part of the book. I hate to say it but in some parts there is so much uninteresting talking amongst characters that you are willing them to hurry up and get on to the next scene. I think Coben should concentrate on the independent masterpieces he is writing for the moment until he can come up with better adventures for Myron. It is a great series and like Patterson's Alex Cross series you don't want to read novels forced out to appease impatient fans and publishers which lessen the overall quality of the collection.Anyway the basic plot for this novel is Myron has taken off for a lengthy period of time to a deserted island without telling clients or friends with anchor woman Terese Collins. Meanwhile one of his clients Clu Haid, is found with a bullet hole in head and his MB SportsReps partner and best friend, Esperanza is in custody awaiting trial for his murder. She also no longer wants to have anything to do with Myron.This book I would only recommend to fans of the series. The Myron Bolitar books are sensational and you have to check out the seires. Definitely do not start either your Coben or Myron Bolitar experience with this novel. With the Bolitar books I would highly recommend starting at the first book Deal Breaker, as parts of the plots of earlier books are given away in novels which follow earlier ones in the series.

Myron Bolitar is somebody I'd like to meet and get to know. Sure, he has his faults; that's what makes him so interesting! All the novels have been layered with brilliant plotting, clever denouements, and some of the most fleshed out characters I've ever had the pleasure to read. This one is a gripping and suspenseful entry in this wonderful series! Harlan should try and put out two of these a year, they're so good. Of course, if that would mean sacrificing the incomparable quality, I guess I'll just have to wait for my yearly fix. By the way, my wife introduced me to Harlan about eight months ago, and I read all of his books at once. I see now why she was so anxious to get his books once a year. I had the pleasure of getting them all at once! Keep up the amazingly good work, Mr. Coben. I may be your greatest NEW fan!",

I own most of his books, even some of the more obscure works, published early in his career. I have been drawn to Lindsey's books by his writing style and the moral ambiguity of his plots. Sometimes decent people do ugly things in Lindsey's stories. As in life, in Lindsey's plots there have been no simple answers.The Rules of Silence is the last David Lindsey book I'm planning to buy. The only reason that I was able to finish this howler is that I could not believe that the plot was really as simplistic as it turned out to be. I kept thinking that Lindsay would twist the plot around in the end and show the reader that everything that they thought was true was not. Instead The Rules of Silence was a waste of time and money. This is the sort of book that I would expect from Clive Cussler, not the author of Mercy.In contrast to some of Lindsay's previous work, the characters in The Rules of Silence are cliches, without any depth. The story is so predictable and trite that until I reached the last page I could not believe that Lindsay would actually write something like this. If Lindsay had a long history of writing empty \"boy fiction\", then I would not expect anything else. Sadly Lindsay has been capable of better work. Given the poor quality of this book and the fact that there are so many good books, I'll think twice before spending time on another David Lindsay work.",

He is unaware that life as he knows it is about to change forever.Cayetano \"Tano\" Luquin, a professional kidnapper, has chosen Titus as his next victim. Tano's methods are as deadly as they are unconventional and obscure. Unlike most kidnappings, Titus is not sequestered. He will go on with his life, business as usual; however, he will be forced to make several \"risky\" business investments to the tune of 64 million dollars. These millions will be transferred to Tano as his \"ransom\". If Titus resists or contacts the authorities, those close to him will die.Titus contacts CIA agent Garcia Burden, who has a considerable amount of information about the inner workings of Tano's organization. What ensues is a suspenseful, psychological thriller that leaves you breathless.This is my first time reading a work of David Lindsey, and I became an instant fan. THE RULES OF SILENCE is a gripping page-turner that left me wanting more.

Tano has chosen Titus Cain as his new victim.Tano kidnaps Titus to explain the rules of the latest game, and the rules are simple:Over the next four days Titus must make a series of \"bad investments\" totaling 64 million dollars. These payments must be made to Tano, and if any of the payments are missed someone close to Titus will die. Titus gets to go on living his life as usual, but nobody is to know of the kidnapping, and the money being paid must go undiscovered by his financial advisors. If Titus should break any rule, or talk to someone there will be a murder of those closest to him. There will be no warnings, and Tano will not repeat the rules, but if you break one of them you will pay.Titus decides to fight back, and in the process realizes he is up against a man more ruthless than he imagined, and if he is to come out of this alive he must fight as dirty as Tano.`The Rules Of Silence' is a smart, well written thriller that actually thrills. A page-turner of the highest order this novel grabs hold from page one and doesn't let go. The action comes fast and furious as the kidnapping plot unfolds, and as the various sub-plots develop the reader will find they can't put the book down.David Lindsey is a wonderful thriller writer. I have been a fan for many years, and his novels get better, and better. Mr. Lindsey can always be counted upon for an original thriller, one that is smart as well as suspenseful. `The Rules Of Silence' should jump onto bestseller lists everywhere, and place David Lindsey alongside other superstar authors in the genre for he is very deserving of it.Read this novel, you will not be disappointed!Nick Gonnella",

His current chosen lamb is software developer guru Titus Cain.Titus and his wife Rita turn to counterterrorist expert Garcia Burden to help expedite the Cains from this devious plot. If Tano learns that his victims deviated from his script, one by one those close to Titus will be marked for death plus a demand for an increase from the $64 million dollar first offer will occur. A former CIA agent, Garcia starts gathering information on his opponent knowing that if he breaks THE RULES OF SILENCE of this game someone will die.Though somewhat similar in theme to Jon Katzenbach's THE ANALYST, THE RULES OF SILENCE is an exciting action thriller that never slows down until the final confrontation occurs. The story line moves at a rapid pace so readers need to wear their seat belts at all times. The villain and his opponent each have agendas that make them the lead duo in a deadly game of cat and mouse, and more easily understood than the victims. Not quite as character rounded as David Lindsey's usual novel (see A COLD MIND and MERCY), readers will still appreciate this exhilarating thriller.Harriet Klausner",

The book sounded interesting, and it was. The realization that so much of our nation's police forces, espionage, search and rescue groups, and politicians have their minds elsewhere, makes the premise of this book, someone coming in and threatening someone in the U.S. who has a corporation under him, very plausible. Because of 9/11 and the various wars or problems in other nations our own nation is involved in, makes the possibility of someone using this as an opportunity frighteningly possible. I sure hope someone is paying attention to this possibility out there.This story is very much more along the lines of a Tom Clancy book, but it is better written then the latest Tom Clancy books which are often relegated to other writers in 'his' group. This was a new author for me and I was very impressed with his writing, and his plotting. I had a bit of a difficult time keeping up with all the various people who were called in to do a single job, and then left.I also knew right away, that the woman assistant was going to be targeted by the mastermind of this entire operation. In a situation such as thought up by this evil man, lives are not worth anything...and he will target those closest to the man he is manipulating.The ending is not unexpected, but the idea of having to keep absolute silence about the reality behind two deaths because of possible national and international consequences is mind-boggling. To not even be able to talk out such horror with a psychologist/psychiatrist for fear of what might happen, and then live with the knowledge that someone killed two people you loved just to get to you...I think most people with a conscience would find it very difficult to do that...be totally silent.A terrifying read...Karen Sadler",

He has a fine home and a good relationship with his wife and their two daughters.Instantly, his world of harmony and assuredness transforms into one of discord and uncertainty when a visitor from out-of-town shows up unexpectedly. The stranger threatens to kill Titus' family and friends unless he gives up 64 million dollars of his hard-earned fortune.Titus, not willing to give in easily, goes against the orders of the extortionist and solicits assistance from an ex-CIA agent, Garcia Burden. From Garcia, Titus learns that the stranger is Cayetano Luquin, a notorious drug principal with a deadly past and possible ties to terrorism.Garcia sets up his high-tech investigative operation and starts working on a plan of action. When people start dying, Titus feels there is more he needs to know and threatens to go to the FBI if Garcia doesn't give him more information. Garcia concedes but it comes with a price that Titus will have to pay for the rest of his life.Once enlightened to the magnitude of the situation, he decides to allow Garcia to continue with the case. Garcia organizes what seems to be the perfect plan to capture Cayetano and his entire crew, when things go awry. Then it is up to Titus to save his own life, the lives of those closest to him, and maybe the world.David Lindsey tells the story in such vivid imagery that you actually feel that you're in the Texas hill country. The story includes the language and violence expected in a story about extortion and murder. Overall, it is a book that is hard to put down, and when you do, you'll feel like you just watched an action movie.",

But they find chaos---there's a bomb under the chair of Darcy Whitehall, Monk Devane's boss and the rakish Jamaican owner of Libido, a chain of anything-goes Caribbean resorts. The bomb turns out to be a dud, but someone is putting the squeeze on Darcy Whitehall, and Monk DeVane enlists Zack to help protect his employer. When Zack arrives in Jamaica things quickly go to hell---more bombs (this time, for real), gnarly Jamaican politics, and the kinky diversions at Libido, where the prime spectator sport is watching guests frolic on the naked flume ride. As if that weren't enough, Zack's snooping around puts him in jeopardy with Freddie Arzghanian, king of the Caribbean money launderers. Suspenseful, laugh-out-loud funny, and with larger-than-life characters, Jamaica Me Dead is Bob Morris at his wicked best.",

I read a review about Jamaica Me Dead in a Caribbean life-style magazine and ran right out to purchase it. Like Mr. Morris, I have a love for pretty much all things Caribbean (especially Jamaica) so I knew this book would be of interest to me. Only after reading the book jacket did I realize Jamaica Me Dead was the second book of the series. So I read the second book first. I liked it so much that I purchased Bahamarama when I had about 20 pages left to read in Jamaica Me Dead.I really, really enjoyed both books. I had a great time reading them and giggling on my daily bus commute. I loved Zack and would definitely hang out with him (if he were a real person). Both books were easy to read, funny and suspenseful. With enough twists and turns to keep me reading well into the night. The cast of characters were funny, engaging and imaginative. Mr. Morris did an excellent job in describing Zack and letting the reader get to know his background and personality. Also, he got Jamaica down pat!I sure hope Morris doesn't stop at just three books on this character. There are many islands in the Caribbean, and I can see a long and fruitful career in writing a book for each island. Hey Mr. Morris - what about a murder mystery during Carnival in Trinidad - you did mention that the characters had visited there?I would love to see Bahamarama as a major motion picture - I've been trying to figure out who would play Zack and Barbara?",

Zack goes to Jamaica to help an old football teammate find out who wants to take out one Darcy Whitehall, owner of a resort that caters to \"grownups on spring break,\" called Libido.Mr. Morris once again proves that he can handle an intricate plot-- with a surprise ending that literally blows the reader away-- and that he knows both his exotic foods and Jamaican folklore. (I still think he should include recipes to go along with his narratives.) He is right good with words too; you have to tip your hat to a writer who makes a verb out of \"curlicue.\"One of the advantages of writing fiction is that the writer can take potshots at anyone he wants to without fear of legal action. Are we to assume that Mr. Morris or someone he knows or cares about has suffered harm from overzealous University of Tennessee football fans? His character Zack makes several negative comments about Tennessee versus Florida. Or course the real kicker is Mr. Morris' description of the two horny airheads from Knoxville, Darlene and Lynette, whom Zack meets on a plane and then keeps running into at Libido: \"Both were in their early thirties, I'd guess. Both had bottle-blonde hair, lots of it, done up in a way that ought to be illegal outside of Texas or Tennessee. . . They were pretty enough, if you like that over-the-hill-Hooter's-girl kind of look.\"This second novel, to the contrary not withstanding-- whatever that means-- is still a great, entertaining read.",

After completing this terrifc story, the reader might very well reflect that perhaps the Greeks were right when they claimed that there were no new stories, only new ways of telling them. If so, this is a brilliant retelling of the classic tale of loyalty, betrayal and greed.As we can expect, Morris utilizes his well-known expertise with the Caribbean to realistically create the Jamaican setting. More specifically, a good bit of the action takes place at a swingers' resort, which adds the requisite spice.Zach's compatriots play a primary role, the mysterious but unfailingly loyal Boggy, and Chasteen's improbable lover, Barbara Pickering. She and Zach's mutual commitment to each other is beautiful to share.The story apparently revolves around Zach being called to assist his old friend Monk Devane with mysterious terrorism at the resort. We have some fascinating insights into the machinations of Jamaican politics, and a very insightful portrayal of how the \"other half\" of Jamaicans carve out a subsistence level existence.In the end this is a story filled with intrigue, and the classic outcome of jealousy and greed. Ulitmately Chasteen learns who is genuinely his friend and who is not. This lesson is compellingly driven home, as we see a man with a perfect plan carry his plan to the brink of completion, only to be undone by his own greed. His arrogance causes him to want even more. As with the Greeks, hubris is his undoing. A brilliant retelling of an age old story. Don't miss it.",

I read 'Bahamarama' and enjoyed it enough to venture into book two 'Jamaica Me Dead'. Unfortunately, his sophomore book with Zack Chasteen, former football pro, doesn't hold up well. The good part of the book is the chapters are very short and you'll read it faster. The bad part is, nothing really happens in the book. It's lackluster but readable if your \"to-read\" list is at an end. The entire story/plot of the book is slow paced and the characters just aren't terribly interesting. Barbara is truly annoying and the attempts at humor for all characters are strained. Zack is a bit mamby-pamby and there's just not enough of 'sidekick' Boggy included.I will probably give his third book a try because I'm willing to give authors/series a chance. I did this with Robert Crais' Elvis Cole books even though I really didn't like the first book or two but have since really enjoyed them. For Florida-based authors, go with Hiaassen, Dorsey, or Parker for better books/characters. Hopefully Morris' book three will be an improvement but this one just wasn't very good.",

                "review/text": "If someone was to write a full-length parody of Elmore Leonard's series of South Florida crime novels, echoing the rap some give about his tough-guy patois, cardboard characterization, and violently lurching plot shifts, they could ding him up hardly as much as Leonard's own 1995 novel \"Riding The Rap\".It's another day for U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens when his girlfriend Joyce asks him to look into the disappearance of her friend, a bookie named Harry Arno. Turns out Arno's kidnapped by some scuzzy reefer toker named Chip with the help of two ex-cons. Their plan: Break Arno into giving up some loot he has stashed offshore. Can Givens find Arno before the crooks get the goods or kill Arno trying?\"Riding The Rap\" gets off to a promising if somewhat under-revved start, developing the main setting of Chip's rundown Miami mansion (he lives there while his mother rots in a nursing home) and a female friend named Reverend Dawn who reads fortunes at a cafe. She's the one spark of early life character-wise, as Chip and his buds come off like dim retreads from other Leonard books, especially \"Rum Punch\" but also \"The Hidden\" and \"Glitz\". They idle away a lot of time talking tough and turning nasty as Raylan moves in and turns up the heat.As psychics go, Dawn is pretty good. So is Raylan, who like many Leonard protagonists is always a move or two ahead of everyone else and ready with a dry wisecrack. Usually, though, the plots are better and the dialogue sharper for you not to mind that so.\"What you'll have to do now is ride the rap, as they say,\" Raylan says early on to some carjackers who fail to get the drop on him. \"It's all anybody has to do.\" I don't know what that means either, but it certainly sounds tough, don't it?Actually, Raylan's banter plays better than that of the villains. After one of them blows another away, he has the nerve to tell someone else he \"fired\" the guy.Like I say, Leonard critics can have a field day with this novel, crammed with Leonard's literary offenses and almost none of his strengths. Arno is introduced at some length as an alcoholic, as if that will be a plot point or a source of drama later. But it never comes up again. Chip's partners hold up a convenience store, which gets Raylan's notice, but that strand too is left dangling in the breeze.The plot does move, mostly because Leonard keeps having his characters do sudden things with no explanation. It makes for an interesting read, but leaves a few unanswered questions. Why, if Dawn is so psychic, does she hang out with a bunch of homicidal losers? Why would anyone take Chip's side in a crackpot scheme like this? Why does Raylan put his life on the line for any of these people he sees right through?Look, it's Leonard, so you're going to have fun reading it. Just not a lot, and it doesn't come close to coming together at the end. Maybe he was playing with his critics on this one, a possibility suggested by the title. Whatever his motive, Leonard was typing more than writing here, and the result is dispiriting.",

I agree with a previous reviewer that you can see a bit of difference in tone between the chapters and characters as written by different authors. However, I thought it still worked really well. The chapters start to get in sync with eachother as the characters in them began to collide more, and it's fun to see this happen. As usual with both of these authors, the characters are very well-drawn and not what you'd call sympathetic, with great dark motivations, yet a couple of them still make you somehow want to root for them. The book also has a great plot, lots of wonderful snarky dark humor and double entendres, the promise of tons of twists and double-crosses, and a great if slightly twisted moral center. Basically, this book has everything a great noir book should have.EXCEPT...a killer ending that pulls it all together.This is really the only disappointment. But it's a big one. There were all these great hints of at least 4 or 5 great different directions this book ultimately could go for an ending. Any one (or even two! or three!) of these twists would have been awesome if they were executed in exactly the way the first part of the book was done. But unfortunately, instead, in the last 50 pages, all of a sudden the book tries to go in all 5 directions at once. It doesn't work, and for me, with those 50 pages to go, the whole book just started hurtling downhill fast and then crashed.I am a bigtime noir reader, esp. the classics, and I love dark material and twist endings, but like another reviewer, I have to say that the end of this one just did not work. Overkill on the twists, too many of them coming at you so fast and making so little sense logically, that you really just couldn't suspend your disbelief THAT much. Worse though was that as a result of the sudden HUGE change in pace, the book had to basically discard what was made it great in the beginning - the fun, tense, snarky psychological buildup. There was a total change of tone and pace just to cram in all the \"action\" and ultimately the \"action\" was convoluted and unsatisfying. This was a major bummer, because all of the ideas and twists were so great that if the authors had stuck to just a few of them and just kept up doing what they were doing, this would have been a near perfect book.I love Starr normally, and I know that other Starr fans are loyal and may not agree, but I had to write this review because this ending left me very disappointed. I would still recommend reading this book because a lot of it is great, but I agree with the other reviewer that it was ultimately unsatisfying.",

They bring together a fearsome and wondrous mix of vile characters on the streets of New York City to create a caper novel worthy of Westlake or Leonard, but with the dark edge of...well, Bruen and Starr.Max Fisher is a software millionaire who's tired of Deirdre, his shrewish, ungrateful and unappreciative wife. The fact that Fisher is seeing Angela Petrakos, his Greek-Irish secretary, isn't helping matters. Angela is the perfect combination of angel and hooker, with a bit of gold digger thrown into the mix. When Fisher wonders out loud what life would be like without Deirdre, Angela wastes no time in setting up a meeting between Fisher and a very strange hitman known only to him as \"Popeye.\" The shooter is Angela's paramour, Dillon, fresh off the boat from Dublin. Their plan is to acquire Fisher's fortune for themselves. The only problem is that Angela is no longer crazy about Dillon, and Dillon feels the same way about Angela.Dillon is without question a bad guy, but there's no one here who is truly likable --- except perhaps for Bobby Rosa, a redoubtable paraplegic who spends his days brooding bitterly over his past career as a criminal and surreptitiously taking photographs of women. Rosa's likeability is only made possible by the revelation of a soft side one would not expect. When he has the chance to blackmail Fisher, however, he jumps at the opportunity. Everyone in BUST is caught in a dark, swirling whirlpool that takes everything and gives nothing.This is a dark, gritty and inappropriately hilarious cautionary tale --- exquisitely conceived and flawlessly written --- about getting what you think you want and regretting it, and the endless consequences of evil deeds.BUST may have spoiled me for reading anything else for a while. I haven't had a book make me feel this entertained in such a warped fashion since I read DIG THAT CRAZY GRAVE by Richard Prather at the tender age of 10. But that's another story. For now, don't let another sun set without reading BUST.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub",

He's decided that he's ready to marry his girlfriend Angela -- a fiery Greek-Irish executive assistant with amazing new components -- and start over. Divorce is not an option, what with half of his formidable assets on the line.So Max agrees to meet Angela's cousin's buddy, a hit-man named Popeye. What Max doesn't know is that Popeye is actually Angela's real boyfriend. He's a psychopathic Irish \"proveen\" -- a small-time enforcer for the \"Ra\" (IRA), who are smart enough to keep him at arm's length. Predictably, given this cast of characters, the hit goes down, plenty of things go awry, and things start to spin out of control.Compounding matters is a hood named Bobby Rosa, now confined to a wheelchair, who makes his living blackmailing couples engaged in compromising relationships. Through sheer coincidence, Rosa happens to snap some shots of Max and Angela \"celebrating\" his wife's departure. Once Rosa confronts Fisher -- who is already under heavy police scrutiny -- with the photos, the plot swings in a rush of completely unpredictable turns.You'll be hard-pressed to tell where Bruen's work ends and Starr's begins. The story is seamless and pulse-pounding. The characterizations are deep; you'll feel you've gotten under the skin of Max, Angela, and even the nutcase hit-man.

When the Def couldn't crank you, it was way past time to shoot someone.\" -- from BustOften, two authors working together get in each other's way, cancelling out the individual contributions of each in favor of a homogeneous whole. But modern noir authors Ken Bruen and Jason Starr fit together like a married couple with complementary flaws -- all the pieces making a perfect jigsaw relationship, while still retaining those aspects that draw each author's particular cadre of followers.In the new Hard Case Crime offering, Bust, Bruen (who won the 2004 Shamus Award for The Guards and has another solo novel, Calibre, coming out this July) and Starr (2004 Barry Award winner for Tough Luck, with Lights Out coming in September) combine their dark talents to remarkable effect, resulting in a novel that is more than the sum of its participants. Bruen brings his skill at dark humor, downward-spiral characterization, and his familiarity with Irish culture, while Starr offers a simple yet familiar plot with plenty of opportunities for disaster, and characters with a tendency toward casual, unflinching violence. Put together, they make up an absolutely pitch-black novel that ranks with the best of their peers.That said, Bust was hard to get into at first -- I couldn't detect a consistent voice, as if the authors were writing alternating chapters (but perhaps they are merely writing alternating characters). Work your way past the first few chapters, though, and things smooth out and really get flowing.Max Fisher, CEO of NetWorld is having an affair with his Greek-Irish executive assistant, Angela Petrakos. Max wants his wife dead so he can marry Angela, and Angela's cousin knows a guy named Popeye who can do the job right. Trouble is, there is no cousin, and \"Popeye\" is actually Angela's boyfriend, Dillon, an Irish \"Proveen\" with an unpredictable streak. Meanwhile, Bobby Rosa, a wheelchair-bound ex-robber, is looking to get back into the game with his old pal, Victor, who has gone straight. When these stories come together, all hell breaks loose, and there's no guarantee who is going to come out with what, or even make it to the end with life intact. The limited third-person POV makes the events slightly distant yet still immediate enough to have stunning impact when several shocking events take place that even I, who have read all of the Hard Case Crime novels, could not have predicted. If you sit down with Bust, be ready to stay down for the duration.As a bonus (and a little unintended cross-marketing, perhaps), each chapter begins with a literary quote, like the Inspector Morse mysteries of Colin Dexter. Only these quotes are from other (mostly) modern crime thrillers, including one each from Bruen (The Hackman Blues) and Starr (Tough Luck) individually , as well as a few other Hard Case Crime authors like Allan Guthrie, Richard Aleas, and Domenic Stansberry. Some of my other personal favorites, like Joseph Finder and Joe R. Lansdale, are also represented. What is most remarkable, however, is how apt the quotes are to the chapter contents, considering how limited their sources were. This bit of unnecessary but much appreciated extra effort raises Bust even further above the fray by focusing on clever lines from other entertaining books that are just waiting for me to discover.",

Max hates his wife and hires someone Angela knows to kill his wife. Angela lives with Dillon and is only after Max for his money. Bobby is a wheelchair bound criminal blackmailing Max. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. Each character commits a heinous act after heinous act, each plot turn worse than the one before, each character action is usually a crime to cover up a previous crime. None of the characters are sympathetic. All of them are clueless. And that is why I recommend this violent, gritty novel. It fits right in with the genre. If you like Hard Case Crime books, then you must read this one. If you are new to the series, I suggest checking out a classic to get familiar with what to expect.

                "review/text": "Patricia Highsmith has her own chilling interpretation of the suspense thriller genre. You wonder not so much about what will happen or how it will happen or who will do it. Rather, the question is: how much worse can things get for the relatively innocent main character, Robert Forrester, who, as the novel goes on, is falsely suspected of a growing number of deaths.Forrester invites suspicion by prowling around the house of a young woman. Depressed by the failure of his marraige, he has moved to a small Pennsylvannia town and is leading a solitary and bleak life. Looking through the windows of Jenny's house, he is comforted by watching the attractive young woman attend to domestic details: cooking, hanging curtains, talking to her boyfriend over dinner.Highsmith presents Forrester's prowling as understandable; slightly wrong, and risky, yet certainly not harmful. Mostly one feels sympathy for Forrester, a character drawn in anguished shades of gray. He is a decent man, with no drive or hope, seeking a little illicit happiness.As the novel progresses, his relationship to Jenny takes a surprising turn of events. Highsmith's mastery lies in the pedestrian inevitability with which she introduces abnormal and even shocking twists of the plot. Because we are lulled into Highsmith's own distinctive world of the darkness of ordinary lives, our anxiety for Forrester is gradually heightened without our even being aware of it. By the time the plot gets around to the events which categorize the novel as a mystery, we are deeply engaged in the psychologies of Forrester and Jenny, as well as several other characters.The suspense thus springs from their own interior struggles, rather than the machinations of a conventional murder plot. Predictably, therefore, there are no easy solutions in the end, no complex train of events to be tied up in one simple explanation.The adding up of the actions of people who are no more conscious of why they do what they do than any regular person, has, in this novel, an utterly gripping and painfully believable tragic outcome.",

I did enjoy the book, but thought the action fizzled out a bit about halfway through. It started really well. I liked Robert, I liked the cosy domestic idyll Jenny represented for him, but I got disappointed when they actually got to know each other, and found that the reality of their relationship paled beside his fantasy.I found Nikkie somewhat unbelievable - could someone so theatrically cruel really exist and would someone like Robert ever be blind enough to marry her? Hopefully not. I also thought Greg's transformation from clean-cut, stable, all-American nice guy to a gun-wielding, porn-viewing maniac a little too radical. If Highsmith was trying to invert our assumptions about Robert and Greg and make a point about appearance and reality she should probably have done so with a little more subtlety.I expected the plot to take a completely different arc to what it did - did anyone else latch on to the comment Jenny made towards the beginning of the book about how accusing a man falsely of rape was the worst crime a woman could commit? I thought that this was an indicator of how the story would proceed, and felt a little cheated when it turned out to have no bearing on the plot at all.Having said all that, Highsmith did a wonderful job of creating an atmosphere of tension and nervous expectation, as my completely eroded cuticles will testify. It's a book that has an almost physiological effect on you - you actually experience what the characters feel, rather than using your imagination to try and simulate the experience. The ending is particularly good in this regard as it gives no closure, but instead allows the sense of despair and horror to continue after the book has been closed. This makes it a rather uncomfortable read I suppose, as most people can do without palpitations, a dry throat, and a sense of mounting panic. It takes an incredibly talented writer to make you want to go through such a disquieting experience again, but I certainly do. I will definitely read another Patricia Highsmith novel, and will hopefully find it even better than this one.",

That is, it's not a page-tuner.However Ms. Highsmith's true genius was her ability to closely examine the psychological aspects of a criminal, victims, and related parties. In The Cry of the Owl we see how the general public can jump to conclusions when a stranger is accused of murder. While all is revealed at the end, Ms. Highsmith also lets the reader make his/her own judgement ... and so we might either fall into the &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; trap or maintain a balanced, impartial view.

The main character, Robert Forester, is not a twisted minded serial killer or anything but is in fact a very nice man. It is others in the story that are responsible for the killing/death, but everybody suspects Robert of killing. What this book shows is how people think that are prejudiced and how easy it is for them after only reading stories in the paper and listening to gossip to have an opinion about someone they do not even know.

                "review/text": "If you are old enough to remember the early 1960s, this novel will remind you what a grim era it really was in America, when everyone was expected to act according to fairly strict social codes, where conformity was king and where anyone seen as different was distrusted by other people in the town, especially in a small town.At the heart of this very unsettling novel is the premise that, once people viewed you outside of the bounds of everyday \"normal\" behavior, you were rejected, guilty until proven innocent, and the worst was assumed of you until your own belief in your own sanity or interpretation of reality could be questioned.This is a book about a couple of emotionally damaged main characters who find each other but whom societal circumstances destroy one way or another. It is vividly if bleakly drawn, and Ms. Highsmith really goes to extremes to show us how these innocent individuals, somewhat \"fringe elements\" in society because of bad experiences they've had in previous years, are so marginalized by a conforming, unsympathetic microcosm of American society that the integrity of their lives becomes slowly dissolved by harder, meaner people who get all the benefit of the doubt by neighbors, law enforcement officers, co-workers, etc.It's a depressing book, but excellently written. Ms. Highsmith seems to know just what she wants to do, and she does it relentlessly and suspensefully. I would agree with other reviewers here that the behavior and actions of two of the characters, Nickie and Greg, seem eventually so extreme that it's kind of impossible to accept them as believable characters. But in truth this seems a kind of \"fable of the 60s\" which places two vulnerable, well-meaning but somewhat damaged people at the center of a maelstrom of injustice and misunderstanding, and seems to want to make us uncomfortable with the society we lived in back then. Along the way are occasional \"decent\" and well-meaning people, but they never prevail and throughout it seems that good people are subject to a kind of entropy beyond their control.Fortunately it's no longer the 1960s and America doesn't seem as essentially small-minded, unjust and unfair as so many of the characters in this irritating small town seem to be. There seems to be a real sociological agenda afoot here from the author, a strong attempt to criticize the small-mindedness of Americans circa early 1960s. It's a period piece in that regard, because thank God we don't live in that society any more (not that our current society doesn't have its own problems). I'm sure Ms. Highsmith thought that the gentler characters (like friend Jack Nielsen) were being shown sympathetically, but the lens of time makes everyone look a little bleak, so accurately are they drawn within the moral grimness of the immediate post-McCarthy era in America. This is like an early John Updike novel morphed into a nightmare.To summarize, it's impossible not to sound contradictory: this is a very difficult novel to get through - it will irritate and depress you. But it's also extremely well-executed and haunting. It's more than the sum of its parts, and it lingers with you, making you look at your own neighbors and your own vulnerability to misunderstanding or injustice in a wary and uncomfortable way.",

        "description": "Journalist Mark Manning has been successfully running his family's newspaper, The Dumont Daily Register, for several years now, and he sits on the board of two local companies, Quatro Press and Ashton Mills. So when the respective CEOs of these companies discuss a merger, it is only natural that Manning be interested in the proceedings. What's more, Manning's lover Neil, an architect, is designing a new house for Ashton's CEO, Gillian Reece. Reece is a business friend of Manning but not a friend to many else; she is generally considered overly aggressive and fastidious. When Manning assigns Glee Savage, the newspaper's society reporter, to cover Reece's new home, the subsequent meeting between the two does not end well: Savage huffs off in a fury but not before ferociously bitch slapping Reece in front of everyone. With Reece's cheek still smarting, more bad news comes as the accountant performing due diligence for the merger reports some very questionable items regarding Ashton's books. It seems as though things couldn't go much worse for the unpleasant Reece. That is, until she is murdered. The discovery of her body is greeted with great surprise, but perhaps not much regret on the part of most who knew her. Still, with Manning's friend and employee Glee Savage as the obvious and primary suspect, he cannot resist wading in to this most unsound of business dealings.",

As always with Mr. Craft's work, there are memorable characters and intriguing plot twists, some highly unexpected ones at that. Despite being fiction, the main characters are like real people to me. They seem more like friends that I haven't seen in a while but occasionally catch up with. That's the mark of good writing.Without divulging plot twists, I was pleasantly surprised to see Mark struggling with some personal issues. He's always been a \"tight ass\" in the best sense of the term, but here he had to grapple with uncomfortable issues. It made him less perfect and more human. Kudos to Mr. Craft for that touch.Thanks, also, for giving us a glimpse into the future of these friends with the epilogue. Too often a series will end, whether by accident or design, and we'll be left with a sense of \"what next?\" for the characters. Knowing that things continue helps with also knowing that we've paid our last visit to Dumont to spend time with old and very dear friends.If you've never read any of the series, this book does stand alone..... but I HIGHLY recommend that you go back to the beginning of this series with Flight Dreams and read them in sequence.

On the Board of Directors of both is Mark Manning, publisher of The Dumont Daily Register, the local paper, and he gave the merger his blessing. Now he is becoming aware of some possible financial irregularities having been disclosed in the pre-merger \"due dilligence\" audit, which Aston's CEO, Gillian Reese, discounts as irrelevant to the merger. While Reese is a business associate with whom he is on generally good terms, Mark knows that he is generally disliked for her confrontational lack of people skills, so it isn't too much of a shock when Reese turns up dead at the her new home being designed by Mark's lifepartner, Neil, who is one of the few individuals who seems to get along with her. Mark considers that the death may or may not be an accident, as the coroner initially rules it to be. After all, off the top of his head, Mark can think of several people who may have wished Ms. Reese dead, including his own society editor, Glee Savage, and Todd Draper, a curtain designer who actually was slapped by Gillian in an argument over how the curtains should look.Author Craft includes a preface to the novel that warns that this, his seventh and final \"Mark Manning Mystery\" in the series, includes a few twists and turns designed to make it less predictable and more enjoyable. I can't go much into that without divulging important points of the story, but suffice it to say that the changes will make the reader realize he may not have known Mark Manning as well as he thought. It's a life-altering adventure, and not just for Mark and Neil.The epilogue to the novel, which goes on to update you on some of the characters in the years after the action, make it apparent that Craft indeed plans to retire his Mark Manning character, at least as the star of his series of books (He may appear in the \"Claire Gray\" series, which include Manning's nephew as one of her students). I may be reading more into the final paragraphs than he meant, but it sounds like a hint that the decision isn't carved in stone, and, given the right circumstances, we may hear from this interesting character again.

Elena Michaels, the only female werewolf in the world, is back to take on a far bigger challenge than chasing killer mutts. Elena and the pack members don't believe in supernatural creatures and think that werewolves are the only phenomenon on this planet (go figure!) -- that is until she meets witches Ruth and Paige Winterbourne. Elena learns that in addition to werewolves and witches there are also demons, shamans, sorcerers, vampires, and other creatures living among humans. To make matters worse, a top secret scientific lab wants to research every supernatural creature they can encounter. And when Elena is held captive by said lab researchers, she discovers the real motive behind the captivations and witnesses the torturous methods used by lab investor and sadistic millionaire Tyrone Winsloe whenever he gives a prisoner the illusion of escape only to hunt them down and kill them in a bizarre live version of a video game. Elena hopes that her pack will come to her rescue, but will it be possible to get past the tight security of the compound? There are many twists throughout the novel.Stolen, like Bitten, has lots of action, suspense and interesting twists. But the difference between this installment and the previous one is that, as said earlier, this novel does not center solely on werewolves. There is also quite a big subplot surrounding witchcraft and other preternatural powers. And there are far more gruesome scenes in this offering, especially during Elena's captivation. The gory scene with lab scientists Bauer and Carmichael is one of the most graphic parts. The novel is great, but I have a couple of complaints. One is that the reader doesn't get a lot of interaction between the werewolves -- especially between Elena and Clay -- and some of the supernaturals aren't developed enough. My other complaint is that the whole captivity thing becomes tiresome after a while. By page 300 I just wanted Elena to either escape or be rescued or something. Other than that, Stolen is riveting from beginning to end. I love the scenes with Elena and Clay. I love how they bond while in wolf form. Those parts are very well written and believable. I wish there had been more scenes like that. The characters are great. Paige and Adam are great, and Xavier is hilarious! He is quite interesting, albeit vague. And I love Jeremy and his role as alpha-slash-mediator. I wish Ms. Armstrong had written more scenes with him in them. And Clay! There aren't enough words to describe Clay. He sounds so scrumptious! Kelley Armstrong is a great storyteller. I cannot wait to read Dime Store Magic, the third part of the Women of the Otherworld series with Paige Winterbourne as the narrator. Anyway, I cannot recommend this novel enough, but I urge potential readers to start with Bitten, for you will get a better look into Elena's life as a werewolf and how she became one, her relationship with Clay, and how she comes to terms with her past and present.",

                "review/text": "In this second installment of Kelley Armstrong's Women of the Otherworld series, events focus once again on our heroine, Elena Michaels. Elena is a highly perceptive, intelligent and attractive Canadian journalist who also happens to be a werewolf and a member of the exclusive werewolf group known as the Pack.Elena's responsibilities include investigating rumors and information about werewolves that seem to come close to the truth. One of these investigations turns out to be a lure set for her by a couple of witches. They are seeking to enlist the aid of the werewolves in helping them thwart a threat caused by a wealthy technogeek who has been kidnapping supernaturals. After a preternatural summit meeting, Elena herself is kidnapped and held in a seemingly inpenetrable secret prison where she becomes the subject of both scientific study and the twisted desires of the technocrat ubervillain.Armstrong skillfully introduces us to new characters whose varying talents complement the physical skills of Elena and her highly-focused werewolf lover/partner/mate Clayton Danvers. The author wantonly reinvents witches, shamans, vampires, demons, and other supernaturals in her story; all of which work remarkably well. As in the author's debut novel 'Bitten', pack werewolves are neither repulsive or evil but change into completely natural and beautiful animals.Elena's eventual escape and the subsequent assault on the prison by the supernaturals provide a satisfying build-up to the climax. When the werewolves begin to take care of business, they go through bad guys like a chainsaw through wood.Humor and subtle nuance spice the novel like a beautifully prepared gourmet meal. The repartee between young witch Paige Winterbourne and the delightfully energetic half-demon Adam Vasic can't help but make the reader smile. The sprinklings of nuance throughout the novel give the reader the feeling of plausibility to the characters. We feel that Elena really is Canadian, the villain really is a computer mogul, and each of the characters really are who they are supposed to be. Most of all, the intense bond and romance between Elena and Clayton is really something special.Although 'Stolen' is an excellent and skillfully written novel on it's own, readers will enjoy it much more if they read 'Bitten' first. The development of the main characters is so much more satisfying having first been introduced to them in Armstrong's outstanding first novel.It is not possible for me to rate this novel highly enough. Readers will revel not only in the story but also in the artful way in which it is presented. Of course, I'm a complete sucker for a happy ending which the author serves up to us like dessert and coffee. Top ratings are well-deserved.",

If you have not yet read \"Bitten\", do so! It is a novel that will appeal to fans of any genre and has become one of my favourite novels of all time. Because of this, I knew that \"Stolen\" would have a very tough act to follow. Well, I am thrilled to report that Kelley Armstrong has succeeded in creating yet another riveting and unputdownable tale, proving what a talented novelist she truly is and that she is here to stay. \"Stolen\" is an enchanting and hugely suspenseful tale that continues the captivating story of werewolf Elena Michaels. It is guaranteed to grab and hold your attention from start to finish, and leave you applauding the amazing Ms. Armstrong!\"Stolen\" begins where \"Bitten\" left off. Elena Michaels has finally come to terms with what she is and has found a happy and fulfilling life living with her ultra sexy, intense, and often infuriating lover, soul mate, and fellow werewolf Clayton Danvers. Elena and Clayton (who by the way compose perhaps my favourite couple of all time, and trust me, you'll love them too) live in New York State at Stonehaven, the estate of their pack alpha Jeremy.One of Elena's roles in the pack is to police all werewolf information circulating throughout the country, and to deal with anyone who comes too close to discovering the truth of their existence. So when Elena finds an article on the internet with information that is disturbingly close to the truth, and with more for sale, she immediately heads out to investigate. But she is shocked to discover that the two diminutive women who are selling this information posses powers that rival Elena's supergirl strength, powers she doesn't begin to understand. Especially when they explain that they are witches, which Elena knows don't exist. But the fact is that Ruth Winterbourne and her niece Paige really are witches, who save Elena from the nasty hunters on her tail and then introduce Elena and her pack to a clandestine world of half-demons, vampires, sorcerers, and shamans.And Armstrong describes this remarkable supernatural world and its inhabitants with incredible originality and verve. She gleefully thumbs her nose at all the conventions associated with vampires and other paranormals, creating a fresh and intriguing new set of rules where almost everything we thought we knew about the supernatural is no longer true.But then Elena is kidnapped by a sociopathic business magnate and a team of scientists who have amassed an entire collection of supernaturals, determined to harness their powers even if it means killing them. And now Elena is in their hands, helpless and imprisoned deep within the earth. Completely cut off from her pack, Elena must rely on her own wits to see her out of this situation alive. Unsure of who she can trust, it's essential that Elena choose her allies carefully, for one wrong move will mean the difference between life and death.Armstrong has crafted a truly thrilling story that had me tearing through the pages all night long. The suspense builds as the book progresses until your adrenaline is pumping furiously. The plot is taut and wonderfully innovative and the story flows smoothly from beginning to end. And amidst all the danger, intrigue, and nail-biting suspense is the continuing story of Elena and Clayton's romance. The love these two share is truly beautiful, and their scenes together are always passionate, highly arousing, and really manage to touch my heart.Kelley Armstrong has penned a winning tale in \"Stolen\" that I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone and everyone, along with its predecessor, \"Bitten\". Whether you're a man or woman, romance, mystery, or science fiction fan, it does not matter, this book is just plain great. \"Stolen\" is a fabulous novel that is guaranteed to entertain and satisfy. And I believe that the characters of Elena, Clayton, and Jeremy are the real magic of Armstrong's books. They are vivid, complex, flawed, and fascinating, and they have completely captured my heart. I fell in love with these three extraordinary individuals from the first, and they have become unbelievably real to me. So do yourself a huge favor and buy Kelley Armstrong's \"Stolen\" today!",

                "review/text": "Several years ago, Kelley Armstrong appeared on the scene with \"Bitten,\" an excellent werewolf novel. I loved it. My mother loved it and she doesn't care for horror novels. The thing that made Bitten so special was the strong relationships between Elena, the only female werewolf, and her werewolf family. Bitten was clearly meant to be a stand alone novel. At about the same time, female written first-person horror/romance novels were really taking off in their popularity. Especially if they contained many races of supernatural critters. I can only guess that this is the climate under which \"Stolen\" was conceived, as it reads like an unnessecary sequel and a novel that practically screams \"ME TOO!\" A perfect way to kill an author's unique voice and vision just to follow publishing trends.In the world of Bitten, there is only one small pack of werewolves and a handful of rogues that occasionally cause trouble. A series would get really old, really fast if every book some new werewolf came to challenge the pack; at the beginning of Stolen, Elena discovers that there are vampires, witches, demons, and every other kind of supernatural critter one can shove down a kitchen sink and they have just invited the wolf pack to join their supernatural justice league. Normally, this organization polices its own so they all can keep a low profile, but at the moment they are in a tizzy after several powerful supernaturals are kidnapped. Her meeting with the witch in charge of the group leads to Elena getting abducted and held in the kidnapper's high security lab. The supernaturals unfortunate enough to end up here are studied, toyed with, and then hunted for sport. Elena and her cell-mates have to cook up an escape plan fast because at any minute they too could wind up dead.The reoccurring characters from Bitten seem like shallow images of themselves, not that Elena's follow werewolves play any big role in the novel. Elena herself seems to have fallen prey to the trend that all urban fantasy heroines must be smart-mouthed to the point of stupidity. All through the novel, she swaggers and snarls threats to her captors even she has no viable plan to escape or fight them. It's disappointing because Bitten was heavily character driven. It's like Armstrong had no idea what to do with her creation this time around, and rather than adding new layers to Elena, she stripped old ones away.Even worse than the characters is the plot. This is nothing more than a supernatural rehash of the famous short story \"The Most Dangerous Game.\" Armstrong's version is competently written and contains enough suspense to be worth reading, but I think the author could better. Even more irritating to me is that she expanded the mythos to include all these other supernatural races. Her werewolf people in her debut novel were fully realized with their own culture and mindset. All these new interlopers are not even close to being as meticulously detailed. It seems like they were added in because everyone else writing this kind of fiction was doing it.",

She is part of the Pack, and is responsible for sniffing out troublesome mortals who threaten to expose their race - like Tyrone Winsloe. He's a mad billionaire with an obsession of performing scientific experiments on the \"supernatural\" races: witches, vampires, werewolves, demons, etc. He's a threat, and a big one. Big enough that the Pack of werewolves team up with those witches, vampires, and demons to stop him. Yet while trying to stop him he gets his hands on Elena.This was generally a good book. A small disappointment after reading Bitten, Kelley Armstrong's first book in this series, but a good book nonetheless. It's extremely detailed and it seems as if you are actually inside the story. Elena Michaels is strong and has no hesitation in \"biting back.\" She's a heroine for all women in the real world. This is an action packed book and was humourous as well as exciting. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed Bitten and even books by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes.",

The first book was about the only female werewolf, Elena Michaels, and her dealings with The Pack (a mini-society of werewolves living in upstate New York) which was very interesting and well written. Armstrong gave Elena a strength and a viciousness that was pleasing to read.In Stolen, Armstrong tries to make a grander, more exciting story and only succeeds in making a muddled, less believable story. Here, Elena's kidnapped (were-napped?) and locked in a secret underground lair with a witch, half-demon, voodoo priest and shaman who are all there because a Bill Gates type maniac wants to hunt them down and shoot them because he likes virtual shooting games so much that he has to have the real thing and, luckily, has the cash to make it happen...

                "review/text": "\"Stolen\" takes place in a mystic variant of current day. Werewolves, shaman, witches, and half-demons (among other creatures) lead secret lives, hiding their abilities from humans. A secret group of scientists, funded by a rich & rather twisted ecentric, are capturing and studying mystic creatures -- a process that is often fatal. Now they want to study a werewolf ...This is the first book I've read by Kelley Armstrong, and it can easily be read independently from \"Bitten\". Kelley's writing style is nicely done, the plot was interesting, but I just wasn't engrosed by this story. Perhaps it just wasn't my cup of tea.The only flaw I can readily identify is this. Many characters did not behave consistently, and these small inconsistencies bothered me. When free, the main character acts aggressively & protects her independence from her husband to a degree that both doesn't make sense (given her race) and doesn't speak well for her marriage (from a human point of view). But as soon as she is captured, she just ... folds. As another example, there were no rape scenes (good for you Kelley, I abhor rape scenes), but given the personalities of several villians, this just didn't make sense. Too often, the author compromised characters' personalities to obtain the plot outcome she wanted.Overall, I predict that the average reader would give \"Stolen\" 4-stars.",

With all the 5 star reviews that is what I was expecting and I had no idea I would be so disappointed.Elena is still as stupid as ever, doesn't listen to her insticts, and makes me scream \"PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR SURROUNDINGS, YOU'RE A WEREWOLF YOU IDIOT\". She has at least started to accept some of her situations, but not fully.Initally you are lead to believe that this is werewolf story, but then the author goes and throws in all the other paranormal stereotypes that anyone can think of. The only reason I can think to put this hodgepodge of character types together is in hopes of selling the book to a wider customer base. The plot line of catch and study and then hunt/kill has been done over and over by untold amounts of other writers and been written better by these other writers. Supposedly this is a way in which to slip these other races into the fold smoothly. If it wasn't a first person view, from only Elena, it might have worked out that way.I picked up this book, then put it down, because I just don't like Elena, then tried again and again and ended up skimming to the end just to see if she died. If you were to base your criteria of a good book on the fact that you get angry with the stupidity of the characters then this book would qualify as a great read.",

                "review/text": "\"Stolen\" is Kelley Armstrong's second novel in the \"Women of the Otherworld\" series. \"Stolen\" stands on its own and while it is not necessary to read Book 1, \"Bitten,\" to enjoy this one, I highly recommend reading the prequel. It is absolutely terrific! In \"Bitten\" the author describes how Elena Michaels, a human woman, was bitten by her lover and turned into a werewolf - the only female werewolf in existence, as a matter of fact. It is in this first episode that the reader learns about Elena's Pack, and is introduced to the concept of werewolves and how they live among ordinary humans in today's world. Many of the same characters from \"Bitten\" appear in \"Stolen,\" but enough background information is available so that the plot and subplots flow and make perfect sense. Elena is the clever and exotic protagonist in both novels, which revolve around her struggles and adventures. She is also her Pack's primary investigator when sightings of unknown werewolves, non-Pack \"mutts,\" are reported. It is essential for werewolf survival that the existence of all werewolves be kept a secret, remain a myth, else humans try to destroy them.Elena comes across a Website that sells and auctions information on the paranormal; a supernatural eBay, so to speak. Pieces of spaceship wrecks, and material relating to \"Zombies, Werewolves and Other Miscellaneous Demonic Phenomena\" are sold for profit and apparently the site is doing a markup business. Elena, after her initial horror at being classified as \"demonic,\" reads on to find that particularly accurate information about werewolves was being offered for a price. Concerned, Elena contacts the source to investigate the claims and discovers that the \"source\" is a real-life witch - or to be more precise, witches. They know about werewolves, Elena's Pack in particular, and want to invite them to a meeting of supernatural races. The ad was a lure to hopefully elicit the response it did.Jeremy, the Pack Alpha, accompanies Elena to the meeting, a conference attended by vampires, witches, werewolves, demons, etc., in which, ironically, the primary topic of discussion is the recent kidnappings and purported murders, of their fellow supernaturals by humans. Computer billionaire Tyrone Winsloe is the alleged culprit, along with his scientist toadies, and a cast of characters so abominable that the \"supernaturals\" look like kitty-cats in comparison. Now Winsloe, who is funding a sadistic paranormal study, has learned of Elena's existence and is hunting her down. She is about to run straight into a trap.As I wrote before, in spite of a new and fascinating cast of characters, and the return of old familiar ones, Elena remains the strongest and most compelling of them all. She is Ms. Armstrong's prize invention. There are multiple subplots, one more interesting than the next and an abundance of conflicts. However, best of all, the author has introduced here a variety of supernatural species which will surely expand her possibilities for future novels. Armstrong's ability to juggle storylines, and change voices and points of view with her characters, strengthens her writing significantly.While \"Stolen\" is every bit as well written and developed as \"Bitten,\" I did prefer the latter novel. I really like the werewolf characters and especially the dynamic between Elena, her lover, Clayton, and Pack leader, Jeremy. Jeremy and Clay do not appear as much in this book. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series, \"Dime Store Magic.\"JANA",

                "review/text": "Stolen continues where Armstrong's previous novel Bitten, left off. Elena Michaels, following a lead about a potential werewolf killing is contacted by a secret group of paranormal creatures intent on enlisting the pack's assistance in tracking down a scientific group who is capturing people for an occult menagerie. Initially skeptical, Elena becomes a true believer when she herself is stalked and ultimately captured. Can Elena escape or will she become just another trophy for one man's twisted obsession?Okay, what can I say, I am a big fan of Armstrong's writing. She writes great characters, and I particularly love how she writes Elena and Jer. I loved the scene where Jer and Elena are alone at the cabin at the lake, and I love how supportive the pack is of each other. I found Paige to be a rather irritating character. I disliked how she tried to boss Jer, and I was disappointed at how much Paige dominated most of the scenes when the pack was together. A little Paige goes a LONG way. I also liked how the characters interacted in the 'compound' and I enjoyed the scenes where the characters were enjoying some down time.One of the things I like about Armstrong's books is how she includes little vignettes of day to day life for her characters. Scenes that reflect the mundane things, such as Elena and Clay challenging eachother to the race, Clay's hatred about Jer's SUV, the things the characters like to eat etc. This brings the characters to life in ways 'big fight' scenes do not.Ultimately, Stolen was the best book I've read all year. 5+ stars. Excellent. I only wish they'd produce an AUDIO edition.",

Both similar and distinctive from the journey of man into a dark region of the world and, by metaphor, into himself (akin but not equal, of course, to Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\"). The main character is deeply troubled and flawed but not beyond all hope. And the finding of salvation, ultimately, through his own power to call out for help and succor--and not by the initiative of supreme powers or faceless forces--recalls and reinforces the power of the individual over his or her environment. Classic storytelling and classic Greyhawk.",

I am glad to say I was not disappointed in my purchase. I found it to have a compelling plot, to be faithful to the Greyhawk theme, and to have one hell of a final chapter. The last chapter was just fantastic, in my humble opinion. The author took the time to think out why the characters are doing what they are doing, despite the obvious danger, and managed to add some depth to all the characters. My only regret is that Wizards of the Coast does not take the time to expand on the Greyhawk line to make other such novels. I am now looking forward to reading other books from this publisher including the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; line and other Greyhawk novels. It truly was a great read, and a much needed diversion.

It would have been a much more engaging read if the actual Tomb of Horrors played a larger role here. Instead, we have several hundred pages following the journey of about as generic a collection of adventurers as could be wished for. The protagonist's NON-STOP whining and pining for lost innocence is the central plot device for nearly the entire 300 pages, only to resolved abruptly right before the end.Nothing overtly terrible or offensive here, just a cookie-cutter innocence-lost-and-regained yarn with two-dimensional characters and a villain that should be twirling his fingers around a black handle-bar mustache.Not to belabor the point here, but avoid this one: the writing's amateurish, the plot is generic and predictable, and the Tomb of Horrors itself might as well be any other random backdrop for the melodramas of these unsympathetic and forgettable characters",

                "review/text": "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. If nothing else, the author impressed me with his very acute portrayal of the emotional spirits of all his characters. Few are the books nowadays where all their characters are believable, distinct and sympathizable. The wonder it is that in TOMB OF HORRORS, Strohm makes every character real and with feeling. Even minor characters are given names and significance, giving them space to be real in the story.Strohm's protagonists are first-class representations of their stereotype - the agonized fallen paladin; the Legolas-like elf, the witty, pretty bard; the old, frisson-laden mage; the stately, stern cleric - let's just say that their personalities are not original, and yet Strohm breathes life into them. Each has different dimensions in their personalities, capable of opposite ends of emotions, just like real people. They speak like real people, and Strohm takes care to enter into the minds of each character when they are in focus. This authorial trait is oddly rare, even in some of the most popular fantasy writers of today.TOMB OF HORRORS, in other words, is not so much about the tomb, but really a novel of characters and characterization. Don't read this book thinking you are about to embark on a physical, action adventure. You should be reading this to follow the story of its lead character - whose fate, though predictable, is resolved with enough originality such that I kept wanting to turn the page to see how he gets through his spiritual predicament, and how he ultimately redeems himself, and of course saves the day...Yes, certainly there are a few loose ends by the end of the book, and one can see how the story can be lengthened. But this is all forgotten considering Strohm's spectacular conclusion which somehow avoids the worst clich&eacute;s. I am impressed with the way he resolves the characters' plots. It would be fascinating to learn more about each of them, perhaps in a prequel, perhaps in a sequel.",

                "review/text": "Realistically, this book rates about 3.5 stars, better by far than Emerson's two Grayhawk books, not as good as Paul Kidd's trilogy. The two main characters, the elvish ranger and the fallen paladin, are among the most compelling in the Grayhawk books. Similar to Kidd's Justicar, they deserve to have their own stories written about them outside of the Grayhawk series. Well fleshed out. The rest of the supporting cast is also well-written, and the author allows them plenty of time to get aquainted and to interact, which is vital to make the characters interesting. Unfortunately, as other reviewer have already pointed out, this long lead time allows little time for the actual dungeon adventure, and even though I had never played that particular module, I could tell that lots of things were being left out. But I think that is a common problem in all these Grayhawk books: obviously a page limit (word count) was given and some authors handled it better than others. Keith Strohm rises to the challenge relatively well here, delivering a story with compelling characters in interesting circumstances. The ending feels a bit rushed, but was overall satisfying. I think there is big potential here for a sequel or two here, similar to the works of Paul Kidd. The fate of several foes and at least one companion remains unresolved at the end of the book, lending to its &quot;rushed&quot; feeling.But this is a good read, and former (and current) D&amp;Ders and fantasy fans alike should enjoy its twists and turns.

However, before he can solve who is the killer and how the remaining trio fit in the puzzle, more murders occur.THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB is a thrilling police procedural that concentrates on the affairs of the heart more than on detective work. The fast-paced story line bounces back and forth between the prime characters even more than a bouncing Tigger could accomplish. Though confusing at first, Ethan Black brilliantly ties the plot together and readers will see the logic behind the constant shuffle.

The jacket doesn't indicate whether the author approved the abridgement, so perhaps criticism is unfair. However, it's difficult to imagine how the full version could shore up the novel's flaws. The idea is interesting, but not well executed. The villain, and the reason for his villainy, is revealed less than half way through, and the remainder consists of the supposedly intelligent hero doing one absurdly stupid thing after another. Character development rarely rises above describing what someone's wearing (with brand names attached, of course). Hoping that this will not encourage teenage boys to buy this book, I do want to note that the sex scenes/dialogue are more explicit than in most mystery/thrillers. That, in itself, would not be a fault, but for the sense that the author is either trying too hard to titilate or suffers his own infantile fantasies. In either event, it is annoying.

I won't reiterate the plot, as this Amazon.com page will detail all one needs to know very well without my help. However, I will say that - once again - I'm having difficult tearing myself away from the book. I want to take this work slowly yet, as is always the case with Ms. Howatch, I find I can't stop once I start a chapter or a section. I'm happy to report the re-appearance (still in vital and believable form) of Nicholas Darrow, Lewis Hall and Alice Fletcher from the latter volumes of the Starbridge series. Seeing them again felt like a reunion with old friends. They may be familiar characters but they are as fresh as newcomers Carter Graham, her mysterious husband, Kim, and the intriguing and ever-so-sexy Eric Tucker. Being a writer myself, I know how difficult it is to create characters - then recycle them - as believable entities. With &quot;The High Flyer&quot; - as with all of Ms. Howatch's novels - I just stand back and admire and pray that someday my talents will equal one-tenth the writing skills she displays, once again, so well in this novel. Additionally, her Starbridge series and &quot;The High Flyer&quot; continue to bring me a spiritual depth of story on a realistic, rational and intellectual plane that I get nowhere else, either in novels or organised religion or philosophical debate. Her characters' lives are blown apart, only to come together again through ministry, faith and a continuing belief in the elasticity of the human spirit. As with all her other works, this one is one you shouldn't miss. (My only regret is having to wait 3-4 years between fixes!)",

Caught in the middle are the narrator, a ferocious thirtysomething career woman called Carter Graham, and her husband Kim.The first half of the book is a fast-moving adventure story, with the plot being driven by revelations about Kim's past (involving Mrs. Mayfield, and his first wife, Sophie). For much of the second half the pace slows and more serious themes emerge. Carter moves from her earlier indifference to Christianity towards a tentative engagement. There is much discussion of the nature of evil.The underlying theology is Anglican (roughly equates to Episcopalian), liberal but clearly supernaturalist, and greatly informed by Jung.I enjoyed this book. I haven't read any of Susan Howatch's novels before, and I am sure I shall read others. It's hard to find a writer to compare her with (some have apparently suggested Trollope, which I think is just batty). To me she reads like a modern and much more populist version of Charles Williams (novelist from the 1930s and 1940s and friend of C.S. Lewis).I had some reservations. I felt that a reader who just wanted a good adventure story and didn't have any interest in theology or psychology would find parts of the book tedious and would want to skip them. I also found the writing uneven. Some of the dialogue clunks. Carter's idiosyncratic vocabulary (e.g. \"tiger-thumpers\" for sexist men who try to sabotage high-flying women) became tiresome after a while. And the social context of the characters is not always happily observed. E.g. I don't believe that a partner in a London commercial law firm would shop for an important dinner party at the local branch of Safeways supermarket!Despite these reservations I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who shares the author's interests.

I couldn't help thinking the insights into the nature of evil would have seemed more relevant had he not been portrayed in almost cartoonish proportions. Pick a sin, any sin, and he's committed it. Most ethical battles are fought in a gray area without the benefit of such a clearly delineated enemy.Or maybe it was the grating repetition of cloying phrases like nutterguff, fruity-loops, tiger-thumper, fluffette, etc.Most likely, it was the reduction of the strong female character to a quivering mass of uncertainty, an empty vessel needing to be filled with the beliefs of others - primarily men of varying degrees of sexual attractiveness - in order to find peace.

His involvement with apsychic healer adds another twist to the story.This is a love story wrapped up in mystery and lies.

                "review/text": "Why do I keep reading Susan Howatch novels? Because I can't resist the positive way she depicts Christianity in general and Anglicanism in particular. Because I am enthralled with her images of a loving God and supportive, healing communities of people.What I am finally realizing, though, is that Howatch's novels are actually romance novels. In High Flyer, the cunning corporate female protagonist so sharply and tellingly depicted in the early chapters of the book abruptly degenerates into yet another sniveling, quivering Howach heroine desperately in need of male protection by chapter 10. Such a sudden and drastic transformation is just not believable. And, oh my, there are a plethora of knights in shining armor poised to rescue her. Her next love interest is already slavering at her feet even before the plotline conveniently disposes of her husband. Books like this one are at once entertaining and infuriating.And, amid all the psychobabble, how often do real adults employ (constantly!) terms like \"fruity-loops\"?",

                "review/text": "Thank God for novelists like Susan Howatch. At a time when Christian novels are so full of the apocalypse and end of days Ms. Howatch's The High Flyer comes through! An intelligent story of the struggle of good against evil and the ultimate gift of redemption that sings praise to the Living God with faith and reason. It is obvious that Ms. Howatch has been well blessed with a healthy vibrant faith that is fully integrated with an equally healthy and strong intellect.Perhaps Carter's dialogue is a little tough to take, but then so is Carter. (Who isn't when they think they have all the answers?) In a world where success is the misguided measure of our worth as human beings, I found Carter to be very familiar in her failings, in her strengths, her struggle, and in her vulnerability. And so very redeemable. Thank God for the journey and the gentle companion who is never what we expect.P.S. David Ford's &quot;The Shape of Living&quot; is a very special added bonus!",

There is a wearisome repetition of coined words; the dialogue is tedious as the main character examines her soul/values/morals at length with everyone who crosses her path. Enough!",
