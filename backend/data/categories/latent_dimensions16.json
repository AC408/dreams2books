                "review/text": "Well, I am a native speaker of Hungarian myself, so I was quite curious to see this book.For the most part, I found it very good.The main part of the book, the phrases are quite good and natural - it really shows that they had native speakers check it.The phrases cover all sorts of issues from shopping to visiting a doctor or even dating and having sex!The boxed texts on culture are also quite good and often amusing.It has only 12 pages on grammar, but that's quite spot on.It does include a box on present tense verb conjugation (taking vowel harmony into account!), and has even devoted a whole page to conjugating four common, but irregular verbs (come, go, eat, drink). Another box conjugates \"to be\" and yet another shows the suffixes for possessions. I guess it's quite OK for the space.The 2000 word dictionary at the back is quite comprehensive.A weaker point is the \"phonetical transliteration\" system used - Hungarian is written fully phonetically in its original form (thankfully also presented here), but the phonetical transliteration provided here for English-speakers may result in blank looks in many cases - you could always choose to ignore it.The intro contains useful facts about the history and roots of the language, though the map showing where Hungarian is supposedly spoken might raise some eyebrows in neighbouring countries! ;-)The layout is attractive, with color illustrations.I even like the cover (different from what is shown on Amazon)- certainly better than a kitshy horseman or traditionally clad dancer could have been! ;-)Overall: RECOMMENDED.If you are planning to spend any time away from the major cities and tourist areas, you will find it VERY useful!",

My last phrasebook left people in Poland laughing at me as the phonetic guides led me astray. The problem with this guide is that it was not correct with some of the basic words a traveller would want. Our hotel staff told us that we were using antiquated, formal versions for certain greetings and interactive words, and gave a lesson on what to say (and when) instead. We also found that we got blank stares when we asked about dinner at a resturant. We pointed out the word in the book and the server looked very confused. I guess this book fails to even provide a correct translation for \"dinner\"...and who knows what else? I was glad to have this book along -- it is basically useful -- but I've got to assume other guides do a better job with getting some of the basics right. If you book at a big hotel you can save a few dollars by getting a free, accurate lesson from the staffers, and forgetting this guide.",

So I tried getting this book to relearn some of the language before going back to Hungary this year. It helped me do just that, and I was able to converse with plenty of non-English speaking Hungarians. This is a well-written book.But how much will this book help you if you don't know Hungarian at all? I'm not so sure. To communicate in a language, I think you really need to hear it spoken and painstakingly learn a bunch of vocabulary words (I like using flashcards to do this). I think it will be more of a help to those who already know something about the language, or at least have access to someone who can help them practice it.I'm glad I got this book. I recommend it.",

The phrases I tried got a few smiles, but the only truly useful part of the book was the dictionary. It was quite helpful in reading signs, ads, posters, menus etc.In spite of the little use I got out of it, I would still recommend taking this phrasebook to Hungary. It provides a bit of security for the short-term traveler and would become more useful the longer you stayed (especially for those who can speak a bit of Hungarian already or those who are studying the language).",

This ancient, beautifully soft, & richly vocalic language is certainly complicated for an English speaker.

                "review/text": "I purchased this book to assist a Vietnamese immigrant that I work with. She knows very little English, but attempts to communicate ideas and concepts with her co-workers. This can be very frustrating for her because we speak English, and have little motivation to learn Vietnamese. So, she's stuck having to learn the language from people that are not teachers, speak too fast, frequently use common slang terms, and have an attitude that \"She'll eventually pick it up\". I feel sympathy for her, so I bought it for her.This book contains a few thousand words and pictures, all in the context that they're seen and used. For example, there is a two page spread of an intersection of roads. In that picture, there are pictures of various businesses such as laundromats, bakeries, beauty salon, and such. Car, motorcycle, truck, bus, etc. Parking meters, traffic lights, crosswalks, road, curb, corner, mailbox, fire hydrant, parking space, and many other things you'd find at an intersection of streets in a city. Many of these picture spreads also have verbs identified with a picture. For example, there is a picture of a car backing into a parking spot and noted \"park the car\", a bicyclist is noted with \"ride a bicycle\", \"wait for the light\", \"walk across the street\", etc.What makes it perfect is that beneath the English word is the Vietnamese word so the student can identify the nouns and verbs more clearly and what action the picture is conveying, such as \"learn to drive\", \"plant a tree\", \"hang up your clothes\", \"wash your hair\", etc. In certain instances, the verbs are presented in the order they'd be performed, such as: Wake up, take a shower, eat breakfast, go to work, leave work, go shopping, go home, eat dinner, go to bed. This helps with associating the nouns and verbs with the situations. Pick up the receiver, listen for the dial tone, put coins in the telephone, dial the telephone number, have a conversation, hang up the receiver. That sort of thing. All with clearly identified pictures.The amount of material is pretty extensive, covering 3,700 words. These words are grouped into 12 broad categories: Everyday Language, People, Housing, Food, Clothing, Health, Community, Transportation, Areas of Study, Plants and Animals, Work, and Recreation.Each category is then broken down into several picture spreads with all the pictures and activities defined. For example, the section on community is broken down into these picture spreads: City streets, an intersection, a mall, a childcare center, U.S. Mail, a bank, a library, the legal system, crime, public safety, emergencies and natural disasters. All things and related concepts are identified in English and Vietnamese. Very nice.Some spreads resemble comic book panes. Job Search is an example showing a young man looking for a job, looking for a Help Wanted sign, Looking in the newspaper, Calling for information, asking about the hours, filling out an application, going for an interview, and eventually getting hired. All with relevant and understandable pictures.For a beginner who knows little English, this gets them started so they can identify time, days, past, present, future, emotions, and other concepts they'll encounter every day. They will still need a native speaker, or someone who is fluent in English, who can assist with correct pronunciations.After several months to a year (depending on the students circumstances) of studying this book, they will need to move onto an English *grammar* book so they can construct their sentences correctly, instead of the typical, \"Me go home\", \"You no work tomorrow?\", or \"I are use blue cleaner, yes?\" and that sort of thing. There is some coverage of verb forms, but it's virtually useless without more extensive coverage (and definitely needs a teacher).The back of the book contains an index, in Vietnamese, so the student can look up Vietnamese words and flip to the page were the English word, picture, and spelling is. There is also a simple English dictionary with pronunciation key, but will be of little help to a Vietnamese speaker since the English pronunciation key will be as clear as Arabic or Hebrew. How can they possibly understand the difference between \"a\" as in \"Bake\" or \"a\" as in \"Father\" unless they actually speak the language? Therefore, this pronunciation key isn't going to be very useful until they are very familiar with a few hundred words or more, along with their correct pronunciation. Then they may associate how to pronounce \"a\" (with the little straight line above it) with \"cake\".Overall, this book, along with a native speaker, is an outstanding start for a new Vietnamese student of English. I highly recommend this book.- Alleyrat",

This is a great concept- but instead of spelling things foe-net-ik-lee, they use all of those annoying symbols that one generally finds in a pronunciation key at the begining of an american dictionary (the upside down and backwards e, the little lines over an a or an e, etc. for example). So unless you are an English major and understand the meaning of these american language symbols- you will never understand this book. Also, even when you try to figure out what all the symbols mean- the pronunciation that you end up with sounds nothing like the danish word. My husband is from Denmark and I have been struggling with the language for years. I suggest that you get Colloqial Danish with the audio tapes if you don't know anyone who can demonstrate the pronunciation for you.",

I picked this book up used for [cheap] at a cozy bookstore in historic Julian, CA. Frustrated to death with tapesets that have no booklets, booklets that are impossible to read, rote memorization of \"vocab\" lists that aren't used in conversation-- this book was a refreshing alternative. As someone who speaks English and German, Danish was an easy-to-comprehend mixture of the two. The book starts out with hundreds of common phrases \"I'm from America\" \"I'm here on business,\" \"Where can I find good theaters...\" and then introduces more vocabulary words. They've brought out all the essentials of the language, in a clear, pocket-size manual you can carry around in your shirt pocket while bicycling Europe. If you get one Danish book, get this one-- and buy some others from the set. Say it in Japanese, Say it In Norwegian, Say It in German, Turkish, Arabic, French... the list is comprehensive. All the books follow the same excellent model. I totally disagree with the reviewer who hated the phonetic symbols. What's so hard about the shwah (backwards e), long a, short a, etc.? Any high-school grad should understand these symbols. It's the ONLY way to communicate pronunciation clearly. That's why dictionaries use it. Can you understand the dictionary? However, her recommendation of the other tapes was helpful... maybe I should check those out!",

If you do not have access to language cassettes to help you with pronunciation, this Cortina series is the next best thing.Unfortunately, the grammar and vocabulary are EXTREMELY outdated--particulary for the Italian course. Not only are the vocabulary and some of the spellings antiquated, but the verb forms are all presented in old literary Italian. NOBODY SPEAKS THIS WAY. Not only will your speech be outdated and clumsy, but you will not understand what Italians are saying to you, because so many of the words are no longer used at all.I have checked my opinions with native Italians--as well as professional translators--and all have told me that the Cortina books' vocabulary is old-fashioned even for the 1950's and 60's (which is when all of these editions were originally published. Check the copyright date.) Unfortunately, the other Cortina courses seem to be equally outdated (see Spanish in 20 Lessons customer review by P. Santiago, September 27, 2001).They are useful as review, because a veteran student will be able to recognise the outdated material, but I do not recommend these for the absolute beginner. For the novice, supplementary books are essential.I fear that the people writing rave reviews about these books have not yet actually field tested what they have learned.

Dining out, drinking, tourist areas, camping, even complaints are briefly covered.This book has details beyond what I hope I'll need in Turkey. Aside from the foods, it offers all the parts of an automobile (including a diagram of the inside of a car) and body parts (no diagram!).Interesting reading -- it has little bits of information that could be useful.

A minus for an unnecessary section on vulgarisms.

It's an excellent phrase book, but many of the Dari terms used would raise eyebrows from Mazar to Kabul. If you don't mind occasionally being in the position of a guy walking into a biker bar and saying, \"Ho, good innkeeper, willst thou draw me a draught of your finest ale?\", this book provides an interesting, and indeed useful, introduction to Dari. Provided the barman gets beyond your initial, \"Ho . . .\" The pronounciations sometimes follow the Iranian more than the Afghan model, many of the words use the Iranian rather than the Afghan varient (q.y., beer, strawberry), many of the phrases are far more flowery than commonly used, and the pronunciation guide and the verb forms used -- well, an additional expression that could well have been used in the book is \"be-resh\" which literally means \"beardless\" but the metaphorical meaning transcends \"campy.\" Go ahead and buy this book if you are heading toward Afghanistan; your ear will quickly atune you to the pronunciation and verb forms commonly used. Think of Dari as probably the easiest language for a native English speaker to learn, perhaps the second easiest after Malay, study the book, and be confident in your conversation with Afghans. Most of them are pretty forgiving in matters of language.",

I used all three of them together, so I'll review them together as well.Creole Made Easy is an excellent introduction to the Haitian Creole language. It provides the basic building blocks in terms of grammar and sentence structure from which to go further. This book is not an \"emergency Creole\" book, and didn't have anything by way of greetings, phrases to use while traveling, etc. Being in Haiti, those things were very easy to pick up, especially with some of the basic grammar under my belt. The Workbook is split into two sections, the first with exercises that correspond to each of the 16 lessons in Creole Made Easy. The second half of the workbook has more practical lessons like: numbers/time, months/days/seasons/weather, colors, family/friends, marketplace/food, around the house, and health and medicine. Indispensable to learning any foreign language is listening to it, and the Pronunciation Guide cd was excellent in that regard. I found that it was great practice for listening to the native speakers (though even then, I was listening too slowly most of the time) and great for understanding how to pronounce all of those nasal sounds. There were a couple of moments of frustration in using Creole Made Easy: there were a couple of misspellings; sometimes a word or phrase was used seemingly out of nowhere and wasn't listed in the mini-dictionary in the back of the book; a couple times a grammatical structure or phrasing was used and I had no idea why it was used that way, and it wasn't explained. This happened very few times, and can sometimes be a good problem-solving exercise that you need good practice for when trying to have actual conversations with Haitian people.Of the eight people who went with me on my trip to Haiti, I was one of two who used Creole Made Easy, and the only one who completed all 16 lessons. I think some of the others used the Pimsleur cds (not any books). I was by far the best Creole speaker/listener and felt like I was in a perfect position to learn exponentially more while I was there. I was told over and over again \"ou pale Creole byen!\" (\"you speak Creole well!\") which I shrugged off for awhile until it began to sink in that this was true. Also, I wish I would have brought Creole Made Easy along with me instead of the Hippocrene Haitian Creole/English dictionary, because I think the dictionary in the back had a better selection of words and phrases I wanted to say. The Hippocrene has no phrases at all, and often didn't have the words I was looking for. All this said, I would strongly recommend the Creole Made Easy materials to anyone interested in learning Haitian Creole.",

But this Danish course is extremelyl frustrating. First, a huge amount of time is wasted with the annoying \"Ask; try to say; now try to say; try to say the answer\" etc. etc. praompts. Also, all of these English prompts distract from the Danish. In teh Spanish Pimsleur tapes the prompt \"listen and repeat\" is in Spanish. In Danish, nohting useful is in Danish, it is all in Engliah. To the extent that prompts are necessary (and generally they are totally unnec) they interject English into your head when you are trying to learn Danish. Worse, however, is the pedagogical approach. I don't actually see any approach in terms of content. The lessons jump around from one topic to the next and make absolutely no use of the idea of learning patterns. Anew word is introduced, and instead of practicing it you are prompted \" NOw, aske where Michael Brygge Street is.\" Really ? Why? Aren't we learning the use of \"also\"? The scriptwriters seem to have no ability to focus on one learning task and present it in such a way that you learn it. Another problem is that the pronunciation issues are not clearly dealt with---yet pronunication is probably the biggest challenge for anyone learning Danish. Pronunciations differ for the same word, sometimes from one example to the very next (e.g., \"gade\" in \"reading\" exercise for unit 5). And what's with the way these are \"reading\" exercises are designed? We don't need a prompt: \"now try to read the next word.\" We need to hear the next word, and other words with similar pronunciation patterns. And why must we hear the names of two streets in C'hagen repeatedly? Two streets with complicated names? Why not teach the pattern for \"Where is ...?\" with a number of useful completions, such as \"the post office?\" \"the bank?\" the bus?\" etc. Very irritating, pedagogically weak, and a big waste of time, aside from the few phrases that you might be able to take away from this.

I have been going through the lessons every day and it's amazing how quickly you can pick up the language. As reported here on other reviews there are some limits, it would be nice for the book to have the lessons written out as well so you can read what you are saying. This would help with the the differences in little things like Jeg Ved and Jeg Vil.Also the course is only 10 units long and as such is enough to give you excellent practice in the first steps of learning but only a limited vocabulary and not many useful first phrases. It would be great if Pimsleur would extend this course into the full Phase 1 plus Phase 2-3&4 like other languages.I highly recommend getting this course as an introduction to the Danish language. You will get a lot more benefit out of it if used in conjunction with a Danish dictionary. I contacted them about extending the course and they said it will happen but in time. If it was more popular then it would happen sooner. So if you want a longer course then go the the Pimsleur home page and send them a request. They will listen if enough people want it.All up I give it 4 stars because it is limited in its scope and could use a better learning booklet.",

Elster's methodology is simple enough: for any given word he defers to dictionaries and pronunciation guides from the first half of the 20th century. Works from the 19th century are cited if they support his conclusion and ignored if they do not. Works from the second half of the 20th century are cited, either to support his conclusion or to decry the corruption of the language.So far this is fairly uninteresting. The reader could simply buy an old dictionary from a used book store and get the same information. The humor comes from the justifications Elster presents. Is his favored pronunciation used by most educated people? That proves his point! Is it used by virtually no one? That proves the need for this book! If he favors an anglicized pronunciation of a borrowed word, well, we are speaking English and the foreign pronunciation is pretentious. If he favors the foreign pronunciation then only ignorant buffoons anglicize it! If a word is used in print more than in speech, and many readers phonetically (mis)pronounce it, he will chastise them for not checking in a dictionary. This is often followed by the information that the unapproved pronunciation in fact occurs in modern dictionaries. Apparently we are being chastised for not checking an *old* dictionary.Best of all are those instances where it is his ox being gored. These are rare. Ordinarily his devotion to authority is slavish. But the few occasions are worth the search. He will go on for pages explaining how on this occasion the authorities are wrong and that in this rare case the pronunciation used by everyone (read: Elster himself) is correct. Check out his discussion of \"modem\" for a good example.If you want a guide for pronunciation, buy a good dictionary. If you want a treasure trove of humorous bathroom reading, this is for you!",

Elster's extremely prescriptivist point of view is very straightforward: there are correct pronunciations, and there are &quot;beastly&quot; pronunciations. Anyone who uses one of the latter is a clod. If you pronounce certain words of foreign origin with too much of their original flavor, you are pseudo-sophisticated; if you pronounce others with too much Anglicization, you are illiterate. If you drop certain syllables through syncope, you are a lazy speaker; if you include others, you are over-nice. In short, the only way to be a careful speaker is to pronounce one's words exactly as Elster does.It's perfectly appropriate for a pronunciation guide to be firm in its opinions. What's not appropriate is for those opinions to be capricious, and defended with extreme violence. To read this book is to wade through a torrent of bile and abuse. Lest you think I exaggerate, here are a couple of samples: &quot;... the next time you pay a visit to the monkey house at your local zoo you are sure to hear Joe and Jane Average and their unexceptional kids say ur-RANG-uh-TANG.&quot; &quot;The imbroglio ... over *bulimia* and *bulimic* proves yet again that human stupidity is rampant at *all* levels of speech, from the most ignorant, beastly mispronouncer to the most erudite, self-important egghead. What is wrong with everybody, anyway? Is the word really so hard to pronounce properly?&quot;On the plus side, most of his pronunciations are perfectly reasonable (i.e., the same ones I use, or, from time to time, genuinely better). If, though, like me, you spent a few formative years in the UK, you'll get a bit tired of hearing your perfectly natural pronunciations derided as &quot;affected&quot; (a particularly amusing insult coming from one who says DES-pic-a-ble, gri-MACE, and pro-MUL-gate). Elster has no use for the language except as a weapon, and he assumes everyone chooses their pronunciations either out of a desire to impress or a lazy denial thereof; regional variations, and those due to personal history, get no slack from him.In short, there's no reason to put up with Elster's attitude when a dictionary will suffice.",

The role of language is to communicate, and communication is impossible if we cannot understand one another. Thus, common pronunciation of words is significant.On the whole, Elster prefers pronunciations that have history and permanence. Many arguments for words I thought I'd been saying all along were clearly presented with his preferred pronunciation in my dictionary. He does concede in some cases that a common mispronunciation of a word has become correct, by sheer weight of usage. He also is careful to note pronunciations that differ between British and American English. He also provides the correct pronunciation of some names and places.As someone who shares Elster's love of the language, I recommend this book highly.

It has not only phrases, but also lots of popular single words (such as east, west, good, bad, etc.). One thing that I really liked about it is that it uses the Yiddish alphabet, instead of that stupid romanization that you see in every other modern Yiddish book. For people who can't read the Yiddish alphabet, it has a very nice guide to all of the sounds and names of the Yiddish letters. It unfortunately doesn't contain a thing about grammar or gender of nouns or using verbs, but just the same, this book is extremely useful for the Yiddish learner. I personally think that it is the best book that you will ever find for it's low cost. I would recommend it to anyone of any age that wants to learn Yiddish.",

                "review/text": "There aren't many places left in the world where Yiddish is the primary language; exactly why there would be a travel-phrase book like this one is a little bit perplexing to me. Of course, it was published decades ago, and apparently hasn't been reprinted since, so used copies are the way to acquire this little gem. It is organised in the typical fashion on any travel phrase book - basic expressions; greetings and general social conversation; travel expressions concerning hotels, boats, airlines, etc.; useful words about the house; sports, school, professions; and, of course, caf&eacute; and restaurant information. There are also sections for numbers, dates, seasons, and the like.As the introduction states, whenever Yiddish is spoken, it is usually through the lens of dialects - Yiddish not having a solid geographic home in terms of major national or primary language support, the language is (for all its 'traditional' aspects) a rather fluid thing. Yiddish is, unlike English and more like German, fairly consistent in spelling and pronunciation, so once the basic pattern of pronunciation of letters is mastered, the speech is relatively simple to engage. Yiddish has strong Germanic tones despite being written in the Hebrew (Aramaic) script - this phrase book incorporates the original script as well as transliterated pronunciation. Yiddish, like Hebrew, is written and read right to left, but the transliterations are put in left-to-right for ease of English speakers.Yiddish has had a good deal of influence in English through popular use, entertainment and literature, as well as some business and marketplace uses. Yiddish is becoming more popular in recent years, including being used in schools in some parts of North America as an important secondary language.This is a phrase book, not a grammar. It shows the rudiments of pronunciation and provides handy access to ready-made phrases, but does not develop ideas of grammar and syntax, nor does it have any background of history or sociology - like a travel phrase book, it consists of pages of phrases grouped topically, with an index in the back, and sized to fit easily into a pocket. For a more extensive introduction to the Yiddish language, one might combine this with the book Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Yiddish by Rabbi Benjamin Blech.For a travel phrase book, it is a real gem.",

                "review/text": "This book covers the basics in a way that is simple and useful. Three topics are covered in the book: the basic grammar, useful phrases and a 2000 word dictionary. The book is small enough to fit in your pocket and covers each of these topics with an efficient layout.For the grammar, first of all its usually missing from most phrasebooks and dictionaries. But, when you find a grammar section, its usually not useful for travel because its too much detail. For example, in \"Barron's TravelWise Croatian\" book, four standard verb endings (-am,-jem,-em,-im) are described for present tense conjugation. What that book lacks is information to figure out which ending goes with which verb. In this book, a \"rule of thumb\" way to add a single ending to all verbs is described. Its simplier to learn and works well with the format of the book. Its not prefect so maybe language experts cringe but its practical.For the phrases, it is a majority of the book. A couple things I liked were that for phrases that begin with the same words, the words are not repeated. The other is it includes an English pronunciation hint for the Croatian phrase. Both might seem like common sense but several books don't do this.My main criticism with this book is the English pronunciation hint seems strange. The stressed syllable uses italics instead a bold font. And the transliteration use combinations of english letters for one sound. Compare these \"ya ne go-vorim\" and \"ya ne gaw-vaw-reem\". Which is easier to use?For the dictionary, it is not huge but its a two way dictionary with gender and pronunciation. Its more words than you can memorize for a trip anyway. There is also a separate culinary reader for looking up food dishes. If there were a second edition to this book, the author should fine tune the vocabulary in this book. Its kind of funny seeing \"Tequila\" as a drink but not finding \"Lobster\" or \"Squid\" for food. Why go to Croatia to drink tequila? And of course its translates to \"Te-kee-le\".This book is not prefect so it gets 4 stars not 5. For a Croatian language reference book that fits in your pocket this is the best book out there. If you have more time to study, review the \"Teach yourself\", \"Colloquial\" and \"Barron's\" Croatian books.",

From these key words, the student is presented with options to help guide her in homing in on the most semantically relevant word for a particular context or situation. All the options are common, and are shown in order of frequency. The great strength of this dictionary is that it gives clear guidance on how words are normally used, and in which context they are appropriate, whether it be spoken or written, formal or informal, child or adult, or American or British. I particularly liked the dozen or so illustrations that demonstrate how proper use of the dictionary can train the learner to select words and phrases that a native-speaker would use, and perhaps I would have liked to see more of them.

It is very hard to accomplish this, especially living in a foreign country (I am Brazilian) and to make things worse I don't live in a big city which would present far more opportunities to enhance my knowledge and practice. So, in order to improve my knowledge I try, as far as I can, to embed English language in my every day activities. I work in a bank and have to be constantly reading manuals to learn procedures, etc. So, all notes I make, since they will be for my own purpose, I write in English. The problem is translating them into authentic English. As an example, I needed to write some important details about giving the customer an overdraft limit. Overdraft limit in Brazilian Portuguese is written \"limite de cheque especial\", which literally translated would be something like \"special check limit\". I am sure neither British nor American say it that way. I searched through Longman Language Activator and I didn't manage to find a definitive answer. I found the word \"overdraft\" in the OWE keyword. There isn't a keyword such as \"BANK\". If you look up the index for the entry \"BANK\" you will find the following reference (LINE 6; SIDE 2 it won't break the bank; CHEAP 1). But I also have a copy of Longman Essential Activator and this book does have an entry named \"BANK\" where I finally found what I was looking for: the term \"overdraft limit\".Longman Language Activator is not the suitable book if you need words related to a particular situation such as being in a HOTEL, AIRPORT, RESTAURANT, etc. There aren't even such entries in the book. But if you'd like to say how BAD something is, what terms could be used in the sense of \"PREJUDICE\", for example, this is the book for you. It could be compared to a thesaurus apart from the fact that this book has tons of natural examples with sections that describes another related senses of the term. If you find the entry \"IGNORE\" you'll know how to express these ideas in a variety of ways: 1) to not pay attention to what someone says or does; 2) to rudely pretend not to notice someone; 3) to ignore something bad, even though you know it is wrong.This book really deserves a 5 star review because it is very good if you know how to use it.

Part II: Seven (7) categories of survival expressions &amp; vocabulary in English with their Persian equivalents in phonetic transcription followed by the Persian script versions. These categories are: informal talking, general data, arrival-departure, in town, general needs, health, and amusements. Part III: Information about Iran divided into 3 sections: geography, travel and sights. The most important part of the book for me was discovering the sounds of the language through the phonetic symbols. To make the best use of the book, the student has to work hard on this section to be able to read and pronounce the transcriptions in the categorized parts of the book Without mastering the phonetic transcriptions, pronunciation of the words would be a daunting exercise. In my opinion, BEGINNER'S PERSIAN, with its rich vocabulary categories, was meant for people who already have some knowledge of the language. Complete beginners, like me, would need a tape to assist them in pronouncing the Persian properly.",

If you are not planning on actually taking a class, I would say that this book is excellent. It provides tips on pronunciation based on American English. (Most other books don't have the pronunciation tips, but you have to spend extra money on a cassette or CD.) The person who complained about the book missed one important factor. This book provides language than gradually integrates it into the &quot;directions.&quot; Most book give directions in English only, this one substitutes those words that you've learned already in Norwegian! It also does what is called &quot;Scaffolding&quot; - they introduce an idea or word in one place, then re-introduce it later. This book is also very colorful and offers flash cards, sticky-labels and more! Personally, I recommend the English as a Second Language version of this book to my beginning level students- because if you really are interested in learning the language, this is a very inexpensive and effective tool. The down side to this book is that some of the sticky-labels don't make any sense. For instance, where are you supposed to stick &quot;Good morning???&quot; Others, like &quot;Kitchen&quot; or &quot;glass&quot; are better. I would recommend doing this book first and then moving on to &quot;Teach Yourself Norwegian&quot; - or use both at the same time, because they reinforce each other.",

I particularly like the stickers for rooms and items around your house. Every time you look at the item or room you see the sticker and this helps to reinforce the Norwegian words. Before long you're counting to yourself or looking at things and mentally saying the Norwegian word. Finally, there are cut-out flash cards and a laminated pocket guide to take with you so that you can work at learning Norwegian wherever you are.

There are sentences with fill-in-the-blank missing words. There are little stickers to help you memorize the names of common household items. There are also exercises that help with gender, numbers, and common expressions.This book is definately not going to teach you Norwegian except when used with other resources, but this is a great addition to the other tools that one uses to learn Norwegian.",

I found that enjoyable.The disadvantage is, the book is without audio. It's no problem for me, as I already know the pronunciation of words well, but for the people who have had no previous knowledge of the language may find it difficult.

It combines a complete review of grammer with extensive vocabulary and idiomatic expressions presented as an introduction to numerous cultural notes. The cassettes are indispensable to the course since Portuguese pronunciation is certainly somewhat trickier than that of other Romance languages for native speakers of English. The accents on the tapes focus on the Brazilian variety and are very easy to understand with sufficient time to repeat for the non-beginner. The set also devotes sufficient time to the culture and accent of Portugal. It even discusses the use of Portuguese in Africa. The book starts with the basics and proceeds to an advanced lever; however, the recorded material may be spoken far too fast without sufficient pause to respond for the absolute beginner. Nevertheless, the course as a whole is fantastic. I especially was impressed with the way that it builds upon materials presented and laps back to repeat certain lessons without becoming boring.

After taking Pimsleur Portuguese I and Barron's Portuguese, I found the approach in this course to be fun and interesting with lively, relevant dialogs.If you already know Spanish, you can pick up Portuguese very quickly after learning the rules of pronunciation, because so many of the words are exactly the same or nearly the same as Spanish. However, be forewarned, Portuguese has several sounds that don't exist in English or Spanish. Also, the same word can have different pronunciations, so herein lies challenges of learning Portuguese. However, the tape series provides you with a realistic experience of the various pronunciations that you will encounter with different Portuguese speaking people.If you are a raw beginner with foreign languages, then the pace of the spoken dialogs and the rapid introduction of new words and tenses in this series may be challenging, but don't become discouraged. Repetition is the mother of all language learning, so review each chapter and tape several times before proceeding. You will find that it gets easier each time that you review.My only criticism is the number of typos. I saw 5 in the first 185 pages, e.g. pg. 185, &quot;agora = know&quot;, but it should = &quot;now&quot;. The book was just published in 2000, so hopefully the editors will correct the errors in future editions. But don't let a few typos stop you from buying and enjoying this course. I have purchased several of the Living Language Spanish tape series in the past, and I found this Portuguese course to be the best and most enjoyable one to date.Since there aren't as many courses available in Portuguese as some other languages, I just hope that Living Language will soon publish an &quot;advanced&quot; series by the same authors as a sequel.",

We plan on spending the first few months of our trip focusing on language learning, but we wanted a head start before we left. So we spent hours in bookstores this week looking for the right program. We settled on this Living Language set and we're happy with it.We put the first tape in on the way home from the bookstore. The tapes are ONLY Portuguese, which allows you to be saturated with the sounds of the language. The book lets you follow along with the tape and read the English translations. Once you've gone through a lesson on the tape and have read the lesson in the book, you can play the tape over and over again without the book to practice pronunciation and memorize the words and phrases.Perhaps what I liked best about this program is that you can use the book without the tape. The book is a real language textbook which can be read and used without listening to the tape. So, when you can't listen to a tape, you can still be reading dialogues, memorizing vocabulary, and learning grammar.The lessons are paced well, accomodating any level of learner. If you want to focus on one lesson you can do that easily. The lessons are broken up into 10 minute or so chunks. If you want to keep going and soak up several lessons at once you can do that, too.The vocabulary and grammar is immediately practical. From the very first dialogue you are learning everyday conversation. It's not just a &quot;phrase book&quot; however since the book also covers the grammar that is introduced in each dialogue.We're happy with Ultimate Portuguese, and I'm sure that it will be a worthwhile investment.",

Author Galina Kimber provides general and specific information on the meanings of prepositions as well as ideas on usage as they are applied today. Living languages constantly evolve over time, and reference books like Perfect Prepositions reflect these changes. Perfect Prepositions details different ways of defining the meanings of almost one hundred prepositions written in semantic categories and subcategories that are easy to understand and use in daily life. It's a useful resource for those desiring to improve their communication skills.",

In or on,as in the sentences `My Grandma was sitting in herchair' and `My Grannma was sitting on her chair.' Soselecting the correct word can be challenging, and`Perfect Prepositions' helps learners to get theanswers. This book can be looked at as a littledictionary as it provides a comprehensive list of 103commonly used prepositions. It also provides manyexamples for each meaning. I only wish the book wouldcontain a section on exercises as well, though theexamples can be used as excercises. What I findinteresting is that the examples help the learner tomake `his or her own rule' on a meaning. In this senseit is good for a self-directed use. It's certainly avery helpful learning device as it offers practicalguidelines for correct usage.Eva S. K., PhD",

You see I just buy lots of books and sometimes do not even have time to read them.Then, one weekend, when the weather was bad, I started browsing through it. The more I read the more I liked it. Next Monday I recommended it for purchase at the college library where I teach.There are so many things in this book which I either did not know, or at least did not think about. This is a plethora of useful information both for students and teachers.The book is arranged in a simple and logical way, and very easy to use as a reference book.I highly recommend it as a tool for teaching and learning English (also as a second language). It should be available in the reference section of every better high school and college library.",

Second, it shows the previous reviewer was simply pitching another book and didn't take the time to read this book and understand how it helps the confidence of those learning the language. Anyone trying a new language knows how frustrating it is to not only find the right words to say, but to find the right way to say them.
