                "review/text": "I found this book rather disappointing. Borysenko is at her strongest when she discusses the body-mind connection and the changes a woman goes through in the course of the life cycle; these parts of the book contain useful, up-to-date information for women of any age, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to readers. On the other hand, the &quot;typical woman&quot; whose story she chooses to present throughout the book is a white, upper-middle-class, well-educated woman who takes an exotic job, marries a professional man, and has perfect children ... sorry, but this doesn't sound like most women I know. Her heroine's big teenage crisis is whether or not to diet; her major marital upheaval turns out to be a misunderstanding; and when her husband dies she immediately finds another boyfriend. Where's the child who cuts school or gets involved in drugs; the husband who ditches her to marry a younger woman, leaving her to support herself and the kids on a secretary's salary; the chronic illness that blights her old age? Or do only women who lead relatively sheltered lives have the time and leisure to consider the meaning of the cycles in their lives? Unfortunately, that's the impression the book left me with. Borysenko is apparently a kind, compassionate person who wants to help people make sense of their lives, but the range of readers addressed by this book is awfully narrow.",

However, if you are anti-male, this is not for you. Borysenko is not out to write the great male-bashing literary materpiece. She simply presents the facts with no obvious biases, and educates while encouraging some self-examination along the way. I will be sending a copy to every female in my family!",

                "review/text": "If you are a woman, or have a woman in your life (mother, wife, daughter, etc.), you should read this book. In other words, whoever you are, you should read this book. It's accessable and easy to read, but packed so full of information and new ideas that even if you disagree with half the book, the other half will open your eyes.Dr. Borysenko is a scientist, with strong interests in health, spirituality, mind-body interaction, and the role of women in our society. This book synthesizes those ideas into a fascinating whole. It's definitely pitched to the layman (layperson?) rather than to scientists, and presents a broad range of ideas in an accessible and entertaining manner.Borysenko's goal is to describe the physical and mental changes women undergo in their lives, and to outline a positive way to view each of the phases in a woman's life - childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and maturity. She synthesizes a tremendous amount of science and wisdom to do it, discussing everything from genetics and cell division to Lakota Sioux attitudes towards menstruation. Few readers are likely to agree with everything Borysenko writes, but her ability to take disparate information and combine it is sure to give every reader some new insights into women's physical and mental development, and ways in which women can craft their role in life.Borysenko introduces most chapters with the ongoing story of a hypothetical character, \"Julia\", as she matures through each of Borysenko's stages of life. As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, Julia seems to be an idealized verion of Dr. Borysenko herself, an upper-middle class white American with strong interests in womens' development. While this may alienate some readers, I think it's worth sticking with the book. Again, the book is so full of information, presented so well, that a reader may find herself uninterested in Julia but interested in Borysenko's advice on mediation, or on hormonal vs. lifestyle therapy for menapause, or by her information on cultural body image standards in the U.S., or by any of a hundred other things.",

Along the journey, she also makes a great case for debunking old myths about women and aging.?That's a Big 10-4, Ms. Borysenko! I find myself constantly at odds with the \"beauty\" images that the media gives us. I mean, come on, why 'o why are we more often rewarding people for how they look and less for what they contribute to society?Perhaps it's escapism - I tell myself (in effort to sleep at night). Yet, after reading Borsyenko's, book I'm reminded that, yes, it's good to follow intellectual pursuits. And, yes, there's differences between women and men. According to Borysenko, women are most often motivated by what they can contribute to society, family, and how to make a difference in the world. Men tend to define themselves by their work. Most telling! Anyhow, I won't give away the store here - but in my opinion, if you are of the female persuasion, you will not want to miss this read.",

Men from all walks of life have turned to author Daylle Deanna Schwartz's relationship workshops because she tells it like it is--revealing what really works with women and what doesn't--without complicated theories or endless analysis. This book is packed with the real-life examples and practical, easy-to-apply advice that will help you understand women better--and get everything you want from your relationships.",

Back then I was so busy trying to avoid dealing with problems that I ignored the simple things that could have kept my marriage solid. I see all the things my wife complained about in a new light. Now I understand what she needed. She talked and talked and I heard it in another language. Now I get it. I thought my wife was asking for too much. Had I read this book sooner, I could have pleased her without so much work. I wish I'd had the connection ideas cause that was what she was asking for when I made fun of her for wanting too much attention. If I'd understood her body then, I could have kept her much happier in bed. Instead I was one of those guys Daylle refers to who just mush around and hope for the best. I thought satisfying her was impossible so I didn't bother to try other ways. I've tried some of the in bed techniques on the woman I'm seeing and I felt like a more confident lover. She really responded. This book explains how many women think and how we often interpret women incorrectly. I hope that someday I'll meet a woman like my wife that I'll want to use everything I've learned on. This book can definitely make a difference in how you see and handle women. Should be required reading before you get too involved.",

I didn't like what I read but know it's true. Daylle's goal is to help men understand why women need things from us that we hate giving. I've always resented when a woman pushed for compliments or expressions of feelings. First the first time I really understand how much upbringing is responsible. She's right. Neither sex asked to be how they are. I've begun to see my current woman differently and am slowly doing some of what I learned. The emphasis on creating connections was a great lesson. I am seeing that what Daylle calls &quot;the little things&quot; can go far. They take little effort and make her happier and more agreeable. I've already tried some of the suggestions for better sex and they work. I have a much more responsive partner already, and she seems to be wanting it more. Daylle doesn't emphasize crazy positions or anything unusual. She did help me understand better how a woman's body operates and how much I can do to make my partner want me more. This book is definitely worth the read! Whatever tips you can use will make your life with women better.",

The heart of what Ms. Schwartz shares in this book is two-fold and true to the title she gave it. She does a masterful job of showing men how women wish to be treated non-sexually and then goes where few have gone in spelling out the nuts and bolts of how to help your women enjoy her sexuality in the same way you do. What's the difference? You've been orgasmic since puberty and your wife want's to start soon. Wise is the man who not only learns what Daylle is teaching in this book, but learns it in the order that she teaches it.",

So not only was i introverted and socially not developed, but i had zero experience with only the insight of my sister to help me along some. Now i've met someone who i truly adore but i didn't know what to do and was scared. I was scared to touch her, i didnt know how to compliment her at all, and i had trouble conversing with her. A lot of that has passed with time and patience on her part through our friendship and a lot of self examination on mine. She knows i like her and i think that part of the reason she's not quite there yet is the way i suck at communicating what i need to. I almost put this book back on the shelf after thinking it was going to be all about trying to score, but it isn't. It's about breaking down walls of confusion, frustration, miscommunication, and fear. I am about half-way through this book and so far it's been very helpful with basic communications rules of thumb, as well as helping me understand her a bit better. It's also helping me to begin to touch her more in pretty casual ways. She is different in some aspects emotionally from other girls and actually has some generally male emotional tendencies, and i realised that i had some generally female emotional tendencies. She will express anger which i admire, but i will get sad for getting angry and i have trouble releasing it. You wouldnt think someone (me) who consistently played sports for more than a decade would be that way! I also realised that i did not hug and embrace like close girlfriends do to each other because guys don't really do that, and that i'm not messed up or abnormal for feeling a little neglected when girls don't hug me (no i'm not an obese troll, i've been told by multiple girls that i am attractive). I've also always been piss poor at complimenting women because i was always afraid of them thinking i was trying to get some when i just wanted to compliment them and admire their beauty. This is helping me move past that, and helping me convey how i appreciate her. With any luck this book will have helped me finally get a truly wonderful young woman.",

Ladies, as a guy, I can honestly tell you that this book may alienate your husband. I do not recommend this book as one that you could expect your husband to finish. You may enjoy it, and may be able to point out some of the great points that this book makes to your mate, but don't expect them to eat this book up the way you might.The great points about this book focus mainly on communicating with one's wife, but at the same time, many of the points are obvious and could be summarized simply as:Pay more attention to your wife, listen closely, open up and tell her what you're thinking and, when she annoys you, just remember that she is doing it because she loves you.Much of this book is cliched (i.e: men are easy to please, women require mental stimulation first, etc.) and stereotyped. I would recommend several other marriage books that a husband could actually read before this one.Oh and, by the way, the first 25% of the book keeps talking about how great this book is and how great it will be for you when you get to the meat of the text. I found myself constantly annoyed with, &quot;When I tell you this secret later, you'll be amazed,&quot; etc. Why waste all this time?

                "review/text": "Dr. De Angelis has written a passionate appeal to men that is designed to help them improve their relationships with women. This book will probably be given as a gift by wives to husbands and girl friends to their boy friends. If someone gives you this book, see it as an act of love that will help you.While some books about what men need to know totally take the woman's perspective, this book is well balanced. Dr. De Angelis seems to understand male psychology almost as well as she understands her own. Years ago she wrote a parallel book on what men want women to know that demonstrates that understanding. In this book she is careful to keep that balance. For example, the beginning sections include separate messages to women and men for how to give and receive this book, and work with it in loving ways. She also states at several points in bold type, &quot;I love men.&quot; She also doesn't seem to be trying to turn men into women.The book's premise is based on thousands of contacts Dr. De Angelis has had with women and a questionnaire that she distributed. She points out that what she has to say doesn't describe every woman. Each is unique. Men are encouraged to discuss the points in the book to find out which of them do fit the women they care about. This kind of conversation will be an important and valuable use of the book.The fundamental divide between men and women in relationships is that women put love first and it fills and colors every part of what they do and think about. Men put achievement first, and compartmentalize love into a small portion of their lives. A real eye-opener for me was one woman's love diary about her loving thoughts concerning her man. He was seldom out of her mind for more than ten minutes at a time. Few men would think about a woman as often, except during the most extreme times of early infatuation.I found it mentally exhausting to think about all of the things suggested here to be more loving. The good news is that no one needs to do all of these things unless they want to and it feels terrific to do so.The most useful advice in the book comes in terms of &quot;reframing&quot; or seeing what a woman does in a new light. Being asked where you were isn't &quot;checking up on you&quot; or &quot;over control.&quot; You are encouraged to see this as a sign of deep commitment and caring. You also learn to make an occasional telephone call to remove these anxious cross-examinations that most men despise.Realizing that most women do put love first, want to improve things creatively (not because they are bad, but just for fun), and are focused on time allows men the opportunity to connect to that reality with less effort and with less disruption to their own lives. On the time point, time expands for men (which is why we sometimes lose track of time) while it contracts for women (filling their minds with all kinds of awful thoughts about what could be going wrong).The book's many suggestions for how to be viewed as a better husband will undoubtedly improve many relationships. I especially liked the section on things not to say. I was impressed to realize that my wife had asked me to say one of these things to her when I thought it was true (in a loving way) because she so much did not want to have that particular problem. This was a valuable insight to me.For younger men, the section on what is pleasing to women about sex will probably be very helpful in making that part of the relationship better for both. My favorite example here was a woman who described sex as a &quot;three&quot; on a scale of one to ten with ten being the highest. The man said it as a &quot;nine.&quot; Dr. De Angelis asked the man to describe why it was a &quot;nine.&quot; As he told what he had been thinking, his wife was thrilled and she described hearing his thoughts about her as a &quot;ten.&quot; Sexual pleasure begins and ends in the mind, and it is easy for men to lose sight of that.As you can see, the examples and quotes in the book are very revealing and take the masses of lists and verbiage and make them practical and easy-to-understand.After you have finished considering this helpful book, do take the time to discuss it with your wife or girl friend. Just reading about these ideas is not enough. You have to talk about them, and then follow up on the ones that feel right for you both. By the way, it's okay to suggest a duration for the first part of this conversation in advance.Enjoy the happiness and serenity of a better relationship!",

                "review/text": "I like this author's writing style and the easy, comfortable manner in which she graps the reader's attention. Barbara has, once again, separated the men from the women in her new book which looks at the communication gap between the sexes.As a counsellor, I cannot tell you the number of times a man has sat across from me and said, &quot;My wife does not understand me&quot; or the number of times a woman has said, &quot;My husband doesn't understand what I need from our relationship.&quot; This book will definitely help bridge the communication gap and open the doors to a fuller, enriched and more loving relationship. First of all, husbands and wives are not mind-readers, and the best solution to improving relationships is always a heart-to-heart talk to discover just what does please your partner, and what really ticks him or her off. Secondly, according to the author, &quot;women put love first.&quot; I know of several men who also put &quot;love first&quot; but may show their love in an entirely different manner. Sometimes actions speak louder than words; words mean nothing, no matter how endearing or how many &quot;I love you's are spoken,&quot; if actions contradict the words.The only negative aspects encountered in the book were (1) the author's tendancy to stereotype men and woman, and categorize their needs into nice, neat little compartments, and (2) the author's somewhat flowery, mundane cliches. For those reasons, the book lost a star in the rating. In reality, based on years of experience in the field, it is a known fact not everyone fits into a common mold. Not all women have the same behavioural traits, nor do men. In regard to the list presented in the book which prioritizes the &quot;top ten male habits which drive woman crazy&quot;, many of the habits would also drive men crazy. What man would appreciate being &quot;bossed around&quot;, enjoy &quot;emotional withdrawal&quot; or would willingly accept &quot;lying to avoid unpleasantness&quot;? These are not habits that either gender would welcome.Overall, the book does contain some very helpful advice in improving gender communication and is certainly a book worth reading... and contemplating. If one sees himself or herself among the pages it might serve as a red-alert, wake up call to smell the coffee before your partner finds someone else who IS ready and willing to provide what is lacking in the relationship. Hopefully, men will not view the book as &quot;male bashing&quot; and will share the same appreciation for the book as the throngs of women who anxiously await each and every one of the author's upcoming books.",

She continually describes all women as being essentially emotional creatures who need constant support and affirmation from men. Similarily, she depicts all men as being analytical and goal orientated people who place less value on romance and relationships. Obviously, men and women are different in certain ways and De Angelis does occasionally make some valid points about communication styles and how to better understand your significant other. But her comments are so exaggerated and generalized that she really destroys her own credibility.Most people that are more open-minded about gender roles and don't fit into her extreme stereotypes will feel this book doesn't apply to them. She is also very insulting towards those who don't fit her gender stereotypes. For example, she describes a certain more analytical and less emotional woman she once knew, Abby, as being disconnected to her true \"womanhood\" because of bad past experiences. Maybe the reality is that people are just more complex and intricate than the simple stereotypes De Angelis would like to portray.",

Projection is a very difficult problem to overcome--but this book basically says to men, your partner's projections reflect her creativity, emotional nature, sensitivity to time, need to be wanted, etc., etc., but your projections are flat out wrong.Peter Kramer's &quot;Should you leave?&quot; gives A far more nuanced and helpful discussion of the dynamics of relationships--I highly recommend that book.",

Some of the prose is in fact excellent for this type of book. And there is much less fluff and filler material than you find in most relationship books. I think it is superior to anything in the Mars/Venus series.Interestingly, the book could be titled &quot;How to date a high-maintenance, overly emotional witch/princess.&quot; Of course many of the best looking women are high maintenance princess types (apparently the author is as well), so if you are dating one of those (or want to), this book is for you. But reading through it, I can't help feeling that if you need more than 25% of the information in this book, maybe you need a new girlfriend instead. The tone of the book is that all problems in the relationship occur because the man doesn't understand something about women. But then that is what the book is about. The author has already written books for the women to understand men.That mild criticism being said, almost all the information is useful and if you apply it, it will make your life easier and your relationship better. Even the best relationships have rough times and this will help you guys get through them, and maybe even save the relationship. And don't just jump to the end to the chapters on sex.

This book does that, but you do have to read a little too. It is an easy read though. It also explains why women are the way they are. Strange but true. Guys-why do girls need to know where I went, who I talked to, how was my day, why I didn't check in. They have to be spying on me, right? It is a hard concept to accept and I still am having a hard time with it but this book helps explain why. How many times have we heard \"let's have more quality time\"? Well I have given out more details about my day like the people who came in, some problems I had, solutions I found,... at dinner instead of \"fine\" or \"ok\" and this was accepted as quality time. Granted she wants more, but I can do the quality time and eat at the same time. The book explains the telephone phenomenon which why my conversations last under a minute and hers are why they have \"unlimited nights and weekends\". Last example, I went to my wife and told her that \"I appreciated all her hard work in her planning of making sure the kids and myself were happy.\" this was in the morning and when I got back home at the end of the day she was beaming and had a great day and the nice comment I said had made her day. Wow, that was kind of easy to do, even though I felt like a dork saying it that morning. Only draw back of the book was that I felt like my side of the story was not told and felt overwhelmed that this is a 2way street and what about how to make me happy? Granted, its usually quite simple and obvious but none the less needed. Well I have ordered her other book about what secrets guys want girls to know and that will probably do a good job doing just that. It should be here today. Good luck.",

                "review/text": "I've become an avid reader of medical history. When in medical school for my degree in neuroscience, my favorite class was one that dealt with the neurological basis of psychiatric disorders. The professor had MDs come in with a patient with a particular problem (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, anorexia) and we would have the opportunity to listen to them tell their own story and their frustrations with their illness.When they brought in a girl who was probably 5'8\" and weight 78 pounds, it was fascinating to see the guys in the class who were normally very vocal and aggressive, totally shut up! From behind she looked like someone from a Nazi concentration camp, yet she continued to consider herself 'fat'. When she left, the MD had the nerve to turn around and tell the boys, that basically...anorexia was the fault of men. All of us were stunned. He put up an obviously much used power point slide showing the weights of women in both Playboy magazines and in the Miss USA pageant from the beginning to that year (1997). The line was steep and steady from the upper left-hand corner of the slide to the bottom right corner of the slide. This was the change in weight of the women who were participating in these 'endeavors' that the MD said were run by men (it was a male MD). Then he went further and said...most women's magazines are still mainly male bastions, as is the fashion industry both here and in Europe. The men in the class were absolutely horrified (and the women were thrilled that someone had the nerve to say this to them!)This outstanding book is a must read for anyone going into psychology, neuroscience, working with adolescents, education, public health, etc. I've read few books with such deep understanding as to the history and ramifications of social mores on young women and girls. Since I am a mother and a grandmother of girls, I have been truly horrified at picking up Bazaar magazine in the doctor's office and seeing what they are promoting as being beautiful. I told them to remove that magazine, because the models in it were way beyond Twiggy-skinny. When society promotes models whose bones are showing through their pelvic in whatever they wear, then something has gone desparately wrong in our society.I am not a feminist per se, but I do believe in equal rights for all. Yet, viewing this particular disorder is a feminist need, and Brumberg does that magnificently, without overdoing it or carping on feminist thinking. I wish more 'feminists' would express deep concern and become activists to change our society from it's obviously deep-seated biases towards what constitutes beauty, for the sake of our girls. This is definitely more important in controlling and curtailing than almost any other societal gender-related bias...because it is literally killing our young women.Brumberg's ability to write medical history is phenomenal. This is definitely one of the finest books I've read in this genre. Her research is meticulous; I was surprised and impressed with the sheer amount of information she provides concerning this problem during the 19th century. Many in the medical profession still believe that this disorder is something brought on by our society in the 20th century, but she shows that anorexia has been with us for a long time. I highly recommend this book!Karen SAdler,Science Education,University of Pittsburgh",

Who would have thought that such a terrible disease would have its origin in the Medievel church, as women starved themselves for their beliefs and to become (as they believed) holy. But, like most things under the sun, it's all been done before, so there really shouldn't be any surprise that self-starvation has a very long history.I really enjoyed the histories of the individual &quot;fasting girls.&quot; And Ms. Brumberg's description of the Victorian middle class was priceless and eye opening, considering how that era is so romantizied by a lot of us today.The book revealed so much about how culture (present and past) shapes our opinions of ourselves, especially us women. Reading the book brought out my anger that society and culture expect women to have &quot;perfect&quot; bodies...&quot;perfect&quot; everything, and the pressure that is on us, both as teenagers and adults.I recommend this book to anyone who would like to know more about anorexia nervosa and its history. There is a great deal of fascinating information. Just keep your dictionary handy to look up all the medical terms Brumberg quotes (and for some of her own words as well). My only disappointment in the book was that it ended too abruptly. Her book had me hooked, and then, finally, it had to end. I think there is a great deal more to be said about this disease, and I hope that she keeps up with the history and maybe writes another volume. Kudos to you, Ms. Brumberg. Very well done.",

For example, she is hurt beyond belief that the woman she was married to when she was a man can't accept that she is now a woman. But prior to this revelation, he had been lying to his wife, and he had a secret life. He seems to have no sense of what a major revelation this was, no ability to understand what it might be like to discover that your husband has been deceiving you and now intends to change his (and your) life profoundly and That This Is Not Open For Discussion. (Never mind that if you resist the changes he is proposing for your life, you will instantly become the enemy.)Also, she has a strange view of what it means to be a woman. Near as I can tell, any woman whose experience of being female is different than hers is a &quot;radical feminist&quot; and the enemy.She not only accepts second-class treatment, she seems to crave it. She brags about doing the cooking and cleaning with the other women while the men in the group are chatting in the living room. She seems to have chosen friends who will reinforce her ideas about what it means to be a woman. In the end, she is living out a man's fantasy of what it is like to be female. More power to her, but I think she would find more acceptance (which she clearly longs for) if she would start with a little empathy. It's all about her, all about what she wants, and not at all about what it might mean for those who started out loving him.Her sister tried several times to get her committed to mental institutions, in order to prevent her from having the surgery. This was vile and evil, and intrusive. Lots of bad things happened to her because of the choices she made (and people's reactions to them). I really wanted to be sympathetic, but it was hard when she was herself such a monster of self-absorption and selfishness.I was hoping for a book which would explore the boundary between maleness and femaleness, which would be about what it means to be a woman (or a man) in America these days. Instead I got yet another man's view of womanhood, with a strong dose of &quot;only I know what it means to be female&quot; thrown in. The world is not that simple, and this author is, in the end, too self-indulgent to take seriously as a reporter from that boundary country.(A better book on this topic is Kate Bornstein's _Gender_Outlaw_.)",

Characters are described only in terms of whether they approve of him/her or do not, or whether they do things for him/her or not. He/she seems fatally incapable of empathy for anyone but himself and completely unable to see anyone else's viewpoint but his/her own.The author demonizes those who don't agree with him, like his family, psychiatrists, and what he calls &quot;radical feminists&quot; which is the term he applies to any politically active woman who doesn't want him to be her personal spokesperson.He is very angry at his ex-wife and children for the way they cut themselves off from him, but the cold, intolerant, insensitive way he describes them in the book and the lack of any sign that he ever made any attempt to understand what they were going through made it pretty clear to me that they were probably not acting entirely irrationally in protecting their lacerated emotions by cutting off contact.I feel very strongly that people do have a right to do whatever they want with their bodies and their lives. However, it is one thing to dress up as something and another to claim that you ARE the thing you are dressing up as and then appoint yourself spokesman for that group.If McCloskey had gotten his eyelids done three years ago instead of his sex organs, would he be treated this seriously telling us what life is like as an Asian American? Especially if most of what he told us was how inscrutable he'd become?I doubt it. It is an ironic commentary on women's situation in this country that the media will always be more interested in a man telling us what it is to be a &quot;woman&quot; than they are in the real thing.",

Instead of using it to deride the mistreatment she received at the hands of the ignorant, Deidre's multi-dimensional story leaves the reader with an empathy for the plight of the so-called 'transsexual' and the need for us to rethink our view of the subject. Through her story we begin to understand in a very personal way the limiting nature of the male and female definitions of gender.This is not a historical or medical book. As the subtitle says, it's a memoir. I've struggled through books on this subject by other transgendered writers like Rikki Wilchins and Kate Bornstein, but this is the first I've found that is written in a way that makes the subject accessible to those who haven't had to deal with this situation.Ms. McCloskey has adopted a use of the third person which is wholly appropriate to her subject. Given the pronoun limitations for referencing gender, she has done a remarkable job of presenting the different aspects of herself while retaining the sense of a completely unified individual.As an educator and writer, I believe that &quot;Crossing&quot; should be recommended reading for people of all ages. As we grapple more and more with gender issues, Deidre McCloskey's book provides the kind of understanding and appreciation of the experiences of all gender variant persons we need to hear. Like Ms. McCloskey, one of my oldest and dearest friends is an economist. I plan to give him a copy of the book for Christmas.",

I was hoping that it would enlighten me as to why he decided to ruin our lives and the life of our children by making the decision to move ahead with his change from man to &quot;woman&quot;.I have to say that I identified strongly with Deirdre's wife as I have reacted in the same ways - I've tried to understand his feelings, I've gone so far as to purchase clothing for him and put up with his dressing up in front of the children, but I draw the line at appearing in public with him in his attempted &quot;woman&quot; guise. The first thing I noticed from this book was Deirdre's complete lack of understanding of the devastation his/her decision has caused his family and his/her selfishness in declaring that they &quot;should love me even though I'm becoming who I am.&quot; I have experienced the same selfishness from my own husband. In other books I have read on transgendering, I've notices the same &quot;blindered&quot; view of these people - their decision is the one that matters, and if their families don't like it, tough for them - never mind the agonies they create in the lives they are destroying.Also, I found the stereotyping of women particulary humorous in a sarcastic sort of way - having met some of my husband's friends and seen how they dress and act, and experiencing my husband's own stereotypical view of what a woman &quot;is&quot;, just reinforces what I felt by reading this book. I was hoping for an explanation as to why transgendered men-to-women feel they have to appear with makeup that looks as though it was applied by a trowel, extreme hair colors, &quot;big&quot; hair, platform shoes even when they are over 6 ft. tall, taste in clothing that defies description, and other exaggerations of what they assume a woman to be. The majority of these transgendered people don't or won't even admit that they do not remotely look like women, just dressed-up men. It's pretty much impossible to hide an 18-inch neck, football linebacker shoulders or a beer belly in fluorescent pink tube tops and low-slung jeans, but I've seen them try.I do admit that there were some places in this book where I empathized with Deirdre, particluarly in the recounting of her commitments by her sister, but there were many more places where I got angry with her rationalizations, especially those which concerned the feelings of her family. The fact that even by the end of the book Deirdre still couldn't understand their rejection was typical of the transgendered people I've met and read about in other books. They just don't get it. I don't want or need another &quot;girlfriend&quot;, I want my husband and the father of my children, and Deirdre's wife and children felt the same way. The inability of Deirdre to address what she had done to them was appalling.I was really searching for a book that would help me understanad the need of some people to resort to destroying lives and families after living, apparently extremely well-adapted for decades as one gender, to create such anguish in their friends and families in order to pretend to themselves that they are really now &quot;what they should have been,&quot; but weren't born.

                "review/text": "&quot;Crossing&quot; is an honest account of a high-profile intellectual's sometimes terrifying journey to herself through a maze of psychological, social and physical barriers. A noted economist and economics historian, Deirdre McCloskey is currently UIC Distinguished Professor, University of Illinois at Chicago. and a visiting professor at Erasmusuniversiteit Rotterdam. She began this career as Donald McCloskey, and her gender change was heralded by accounts in The Chronicle of Higher Ed and elsewhere.Arranged in three sections named for a progression of personae -- &quot;Donald,&quot; &quot;Dee,&quot; and &quot;Deirdre,&quot; the book follows decades of furtive cross-dressing to a moment of epiphany in 1994 at the age of 52, followed by learning to &quot;pass&quot;as a woman, by loss of family and some friends, by painful surgery, and on to discovering new friend, and rediscovering the world (and the academic discipline of economics) through the eyes of a woman. Joys -- a child born, named for her -- sorrows -- her own children, long since grown, refusing to acknowledge her. Well paced yet thoughtful, &quot;Crossing&quot; reads like a novel despite its long passages of musing on the economic, social and political aspects of her situation and of that of other crossers, of women, and of men in a &quot;free&quot; society that is severely opressive to those whose free choice is to redefine their gender expression. Want to know more about these issues? Or just want to know a brave new woman better? Buy the book.The medical profession has labeled crossing as a medical condition, &quot;transsexualism,&quot; for which there is a specific cure, an agonizingly slow course of treatment consisting of counseling, mandatory two years living as the other gender, hormone therapy, and gender assignment surgery, most of which is regarded by the insurance industry as strictly elective and uninsurable. McCloskey makes the excellent point, not always made clear, that the two year's waiting game thus mandated is not only quite dangerous to many crossers, due to the activities of &quot;gay&quot; bashers but is in most places illegal. Police, firemen, EMTs, doctors, and nurses have all been known to slow down or even stop rendering assistance when faced with &quot;pre-op&quot; gender crossers. In the case publicised by the 1999 film &quot;Boy's Don't Cry,&quot; the attitude of the police actually contributed to the death of a young woman, living as a man, at the hands of intolerant youths. Given the often painful struggle Donald went through to become Deirdre, it is interesting to note that criticism of her memoir is often directed, sometimes by women, to what is thought to be the flaw in her theory of womanhood; the word &quot;stereotyping&quot; is bandied about, in a tone suggesting that it is improper to notice how women move, how men move, and that we know and can tell the difference almost immediately. Such knowledge is vital to the crosser, who needs it in order to survive, yet describing these cultural realities invites ridicule. I think the flaw is in the thinking of the critics here, not that of our author. Stereotyping is simple habituation -- the habitual awareness of characteristics statistically common to a population -- raised to a pernicious art form by its being applied to individuals in order to objectify them. It's a power move, used either by oppressed or oppressors, to dehumanize the opposition. When Deirdre McCloskey observes male behavior and its consequences, or female behavior she wishes to learn, in individuals, this is not sterootyping, it's recognition -- since she has no agenda to objectify anyone. The chapter on the women's culture of gifts -- required reading for anyone hoping to make this a better world -- should be convincing on this point. One of the deepest attractions of womanhood to a gender-crossing male is the opportunity to inhabit a space of caring, of not needing to play the game of winning. McCloskey says it best: &quot;One of the policemen asked Dee, 'Is this about money?' He meant: You obviously are not crazy; is your sister trying to get you declared crazy in order to take over some inheritance? 'No,' said Dee, &quot;It's about love.&quot;",

She is a woman who spent most of her fifty-something years trying to be a man, and a gender rebel who is one of its most ardent defenders. It has long been a source of embarrassment and irritation to me, but many of us transsexuals are profoundly conservative when it comes to gender roles, and McCloskey is no exception. When she rhapsodizes on her newly-acquired compulsion to clean, I'm tempted to send her a list of the women I know who could give Oscar Madison slob lessons. Dusting is NOT in one's DNA.Nonetheless, one cannot help but feel for McCloskey, who suffered the torments of the damned to become who she truly is. Ironically, the lion's share of prejudice and fear came not from her friends and colleagues (most of whom accepted her) but from members of her own family. The one clear villian of this book is her psychologist sister (I thank whatever God is out there that thre are no shrinks in my family) who has Dierdre committed no less than three times. Her view, apparently, is that transsexuals are delusional in the same sense as a man who believes he is Napoleon. That there are professionals who still hold this view is frightening--the fact they can succeed in committing a transsexual multiple times is terrifying.All in all, this book is a compelling study of the roller-coaster process of changing gender. Yet women, both transsexual and natural-born, will be infuriated for decades by this &quot;tranny come lately,&quot; who preseumes to tell them what being a woman is.",

His wife abandons him; she cannot accept the fact that her husband is having surgery to become a woman.

I didn't find the book all that engaging; I grew bored with the author's continual defensiveness, and self-pitying posture. She divides the world into those who support her and Enemies. The latter category consists of anyone who questions her intentions. She skips the usual one or two year waiting period and accompanying psychological analysis required of transsexuals planning sex reassignment surgery in the United States.

The narrator (and subject) has such a stereotypical view of what it means to be a woman--she suggests that the only way she could explore the softer side of herself was to become a woman. Donald would have done that, but Dierdre reacts this way instead--as if adding a few hormones and removing some body parts can change the essence of a person. As a woman, I'm offended at all the assumptions this author makes about women's feelings and actions--women can be tough and obnoxious, too, just as Dierdre's former male self. As well, the author seems to be fairly taken with her own intelligence--and suggests that as a woman, it would be harder to pull off such massive intellect. Finally, the author needed to think a little more even-handedly about the subject, even if she had a strong opinion on it, because otherwise it just sounds a like a book-long pitch--&quot;You should like and accept me!&quot; Explore some of the negative opinions have about gender crossing, or misperceptions, and treat them directly, rather than showing those in opposition as the devil--perhaps show some understanding of where those people are coming from.",

Both theories are important and although psychologists and DV advocates have since expanded on both and developed new ideas, Walker's ideas still have a place in the history of the development of an understanding of battered women's lives and experiences. I would recommend it as a good starting point in a reader's search for an understanding of domestic violence. Since then, more authoritative texts based on more extensive and better-documented research have been published, but The Battered Woman serves it's instructive purpose well.

                "review/text": "Walker has attempted to explain how battering incidents occur, what a battered woman is, how one gets out of a battering relationship, and why there are battering relationships in society. Although Walker does a thorough job answering these questions, her work has been in print thirty-one years. Thus, it caused me as a reader to question the relevance of her work at the present time. If Walker's work is relevant to today, is her Cycle Theory of Violence relevant as well?First of all, The Battered Woman has been in circulation since 1979. This has caused me to dismiss the book to some degree as irrelevant to the twenty-first century. Instead, I viewed Walker's work more as a breakthrough in understanding violence in relationships in the 1980's. I read the book more as an historical record. Walker indicates, \"Some observers, including myself, estimate that as many as 50 percent of all women will be battering victims at some point in their lives\" (ix). After this estimation, any reader will naturally assume that since 1979 there has been much progress in eliminating the battering problem; therefore, today's battering incidents must be at their lowest rates. Surprisingly, according to asafeplaceforhelp.org, \"7% of women (3.9 million) are physically abused by their partners, and 37% (20.7 million) are verbally or emotionally abused,\" so the total number of women abused every year should be 43% (24.6 million). In this light, the battering problem as a whole still appears to remain large to this day, and Walker's book continues to offer insight and vital understanding about this problem.Secondly, after establishing that Walker's work on the subject of abuse of women continues to be relevant to today's society, since the battering problem continues to prevail. New questions arise on the applicability of author's Cycle Theory of Violence to same-sex relationships. According to the National Organization for Women website, \"Regional studies demonstrate domestic violence is as much of a problem within LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) communities as it is among heterosexual ones\". Walker describes the Cycle Theory of Violence in three phases.The first phase is regarded as the tension building stage, where minor battering incidents occur. In this stage women psychologically deny the reality of an incident and hide their anger through rationalization. To prevent the batterer's anger from escalating, a woman becomes \"nurturing, compliant, and may anticipate his every whim; or she may stay out of his way\" (56). The batterer translates this passive behavior as acceptance of his abuse and continues the abusive behavior. Meanwhile, the woman's anger continues to increase steadily with each consecutive minor battering incident. This leads to phase two, known as the acute battering incident. In this phase all the tension from phase one is released in uncontrollable nature. Both the degree of violence and the arrival of the acute stage are impossible to predict. After the acute battering incident, the final phase, referred to as kindness and contrite loving behavior or \"honeymoon phase,\" follows. In this phase \"the batterer constantly behaves in a charming and loving manner\" (65). The batterer is sorry for his actions, asks for forgiveness, promises he will never behave that way again, and thinks he can control himself after what has happened. Because of the honeymoon phase, the woman is convinced that abusive behavior will cease and remains in the relationship. The end of third phase is marked by the beginning of minor battering incidents.Walker describes all three phases in terms of the man as a batterer and the woman as a victim. Therefore, it becomes difficult to apply the Cycle Theory of Violence to same-sex couples, especially lesbians, since, according to the author's model, the batterer is assumed to be always a male of \"all ages, races, religions(including no religion), education levels, cultures, and socioeconomic groups\" (36). In the comparison to same-sex couples, Walker's outline of common characteristics of battered women and men who batter appears to be inapplicable in statements like a battered woman \"...is a traditionalist about the home, [and] strongly believes in family unity and the prescribed feminine sex-role stereotype.\" This approach is precisely incorrect since society's view of homosexual relationships is regarded specifically as non-traditional. If a battered woman stays in a relationship because tradition has been ingrained in her as a value, then how can one relate the same characteristics to a lesbian who stays in a same-sex relationship? That characteristic simply does not exist in battering relationships among lesbians, yet the battering occurs there too. Perhaps this particular characteristic and others should be withheld altogether if we are to study why battering occurs in relationships as a whole.In the end, Walker is regarded as a pioneer for speaking out about domestic violence against women. She has done an incredible job defining what a battered woman is through her Cycle Theory of Violence. Although there is no mention of why Walker has not included same-sex battering relationships in her studies, she states,\"This is a self-volunteered sample. These women were not randomly selected, and they cannot be considered a legitimate data base from which to make specific generalizations. Therefore, throughout this book I have attempted not to use statistics to analyze any of the data. Rather, I have concentrated on the commonalities expressed by the battered women and generalized from them\" (xiii).Based on her statement, the self-volunteered sample is hardly a random sample. Thus, it is difficult to know how accurately Walker's sample reflects the entire population. I also question whether Walker had included a courtesy bias in her interviews since the author specifically states in the introduction that her feminist views were reflected in her private psychotherapy. Nevertheless, Walker's book definitely emphasizes the domestic violence and undoubtedly raised a much needed awareness of the problem in 1979.",

Reed was a lifelong student of anthropology and her scientific and materialist explanation of the pivotal role women have played in the development of humanity are necessary tools for anyone seeking to change the status of women for the better. The book is imbued with this. Though a serious work of scholorship, it is foremost a book for fighters. It stands along side Frederick Engel's, &quot;Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State&quot; in this regard.Reed traces the development of human societies, with particular attention to the role of women, from the early matriarchal clans of hunters and gatherers, to the growth of agriculture, to the rise of the first states and beyond. Her defense of the matriarchal nature of the early clans devastates the many defenders of the idea that society was always patriarchal and women are doomed to being the second sex. It also lays waste the idea that men are &quot;by nature&quot; oppressors of women. It is a welcome antidote to the many &quot;spiritual&quot; works on women as well as the psuedo scientific defenders of women's oppression.The book is important for any student of human history. Among it's particular contributions:The explanation of the incest taboos as originating in taboos on cannibalism; the role of women in the development of agriculture; the significance of human sacrifice and why it ended (this section is particularly useful for students of Meso-American history); the evolution of lineage and kinship groupings prior to and after the formation of the first city states; the role of the state and private property in cementing the dominance of men and the patriarchy, etc. Her defense of both the evolutionary and comparative methods of anthropology, and her consistant materialism make the book a part of an important ongoing debate in scientific circles. A debate which is interesting to any reader looking for an explanation of why society is organized the way it is.The book is a serious scientific work and takes work to read, though it is fascinating work. Her other books, &quot;Problems of Women's Liberation&quot; and &quot;Sexism and Science&quot; are useful introductions to some of the concepts explored here.Women's Evolution is necessary reading for any student of anthropology. It is ignored by most anthropologists who have made their careers as defenders of the status quo and for the same reasons have ignored Engels, Lewis Henry Morgan, Bachofen and others. Though they often polemicize against them and their ideas. Reed wrote the book as a fighter for women's rights and an anti-capitalist, the work is dedicated to young feminists.",

If you are looking for evidence against this argument, look no further. Evelyn Reed, who was a feminist, socialist and anthropologist, provides a mountain of evidence about early human societies, which shows that, without a doubt, women have not always been subordinate to men. In painstaking, shocking and sometimes even humorous detail, she reconstructs the prehistoric matriarchal societies that spanned the globe thousands of years ago. She draws on myths, anthropological studies of modern-day \"primitive\" peoples, and even Greek dramas to show that it took a long and bloody period of evolution for the \"father-family\" to develop and for women to become subordinated to men.

In no other species do the two sexes battle against each other.In this book we learn that things weren't always this way. In fact, for most of human history women were the heads of the extended family. Oppression and exploitation are recent inventions.So, the moral of this story is one of hope. The knowledge that female inferiority today is not biologically determined, that women were once the organizers and leaders of social life, should heighten the self-confidence of all who aspire for equality and justice. If humankind was capable of remaking itself once, and based on that has advanced dramatically in a limited sense of creating material culture, then we can remake ourselves again and found a culture that enriches all aspects of everyone's lives. But this time the redesign will have to be conscious and conscientious, the beginning of a humane human history in which all participate on an equal basis. Such is the future that socialism and communism promise for us.Anthropologists will have serious reservations on the second chapter of this book, which deals with cannibalism. Anthropologists and students of gender studies of all orientations now doubt the assertion that humanity had a cannibalistic stage in our past. Whether or not one accepts Reed's evidence on this score, the rest of the argument remains solid: the overwhelming part of human history is herstory.As a companion to this volume, be sure to read Origin of Family, State and Private Property, by Engels. Written a century earlier, it put forward the theory of our matriarchal heritage. Women's Evolution compiled anthropology's evidence that many still do not care to publish even some thirty years later.",

She took years, she examined everything published on the subject, she questioned what she had thought, and she corresponded with scientists and activists all over the world.

Relations between men and women and children were different. This history is needed so we can see how we can make changes that can fundamentally improve the relations between women and men, through socialist revolution and the ending of this society's sexism.While this book is not always available on Amazon, it is always available from BooksfromPathfinder, an Amazon Z store that you can get to by clicking on New and Used further up this page!",

Hence, I wasn't surprised that Reichman's book was better than the typical book espousing scented candles, dim lights, and other such glib superficialities as the panacea for all sexual problems. That said, I was nevertheless disappointed by this book. There were too many factual errors and inconsistencies in it (as a doctor, I think I'm qualified to say that). Even some drug names were misspelled -- not a big deal, perhaps, but if a doc can't correctly spell the name of a drug, one wonders if commensurate care was given to the other facts presented. In this case, I was disappointed. The professionalism of the book was further eroded by Reichman's frequent puns and attempts at interjected humor. I have nothing against doctors showing their human side, but when Reichman did it, it seemed stilted, not natural. I could excuse all of these drawbacks if the book were packed with more information, but its scope was very narrow and there was so much the author could have said that she did not.",

                "review/text": "There's a surprise category in this book. But, first, what's best about the book.I recommend the book to most of my female patients because it gives an excellent description of all of the causes of a woman's decreased libido. Reading this book gives a good framework for talking with the physician and for taking responsibility for improved health.Perhaps she underestimates the power of testosterone. No matter what else goes on, if that hormone is low, a woman will struggle with her libido. If you're considering changing the way you replace your horomones and want more details about the personal experiences of someone before and after proper hormone replacement, read Suzane Summer's latest book.The surprise category is this: Men can be the cause of a woman's decreased libido. The way Dr. Reichman explains it: if the man has ejaculation and quits before the woman is satisfied, then the woman experiences frustration and loses desire for sex. Replacing the hormones of a few thousand women has taught me that this problem is much more common than most men know (the woman does love her husband and so doesn't want to tell him). Dr. Reichman tries to address this problem by writing a few pages about impotence in males.Here's the problem, most men will not seek treatment from a physician (only about 30% of men with erectile dysfunction...impotence or premature ejaculation...will see a physician). So, I often find Dr. Reichman's category to be a real one: men do contribute to the decreased libido of a woman when they don't understand how to provide prolonged love making for the woman who needs it to achieve orgasm.Dr. Reichman doesn't expand on the problem of men as the cause of decreased libido, but another common problem in my practice is that the woman comes to see me with decreased libido, then after I treat her the husband can't keep up with her. So, she goes from decreased libido, to improved libido, to frustration and decreased libido again. Because my women patients usually can't convince their husbands to come see me, I wrote a 15-day course for men: Anytime...for as Long as You Want: Strength, Genius, Libido, and Erection by Integrative Sex Transmutation.Now, I ask my women patients to read Dr. Reichman's book. Then when the woman improves her libido (with the book and my hormone therapy), I give the woman the book Anytime...for as Long as You Want (which comes with an audio CD) to help her convince her husband to seek help in keeping up with her new libido.Read both of these books and don't give up. Just a few months ago, I had a 65-year-old patient brag to me that she had her first orgasm just a few weeks after starting therapy as descirbed in this book. Her husband of many years only smiled.--Charles Runels, MDAuthor of \"Anytime for as Long as You Want: Strength, Genius, Libido, & Erection by Integrative Sex Transmutation (A 15-Day Course for Men to Improve Sex and Life)\"",

The book has had the beneficial effect that most of my patients are able to honestly reveal if there is marital discord that may not have been admitted to in the first appointment. Opening up the way for a sex therapist or marriage counselor has been another positive benefit of this book. I find that many of my patients were reluctant to consider counseling in the first appointment, but were willing to include counseling as part of the treatment plan of their decreased libido. So many women learn about the female body and functions for the first time while reading this book. Every patient has been very happy with this book and no longer felt alone with this problem. They were able to realize that other women have suffered with this same problem and that, most of the time, there is positive results with hormones, exercise, honest communication with their spouse, counseling and/or treatment for depression.

A society where the United States of America had had nothing but women presidents and every state was predominantly represented by women, though males account for half the population. Where the predominant forms of music for the last fifty years have all treated men as an interesting and occasionally useful, but often annoying or even maddening objects, and us men run around in skimpy calvin klein-style underwear on MTV while hip-hop women constantly call us \"dogs\" in their raps and the classic rock section of the local used music store overflows with female lyrics that question what is more important in life, men, cars, or booze? and blame us men for breaking their poor girl hearts and for being warlocks, (...), or idiots (while the woman rock stars collect millions of dollars and boy groupies run around ready to have sex with any security guard to get a shot to have sex with the famous women).A society where families are dominated by mothers and their husbands live in fear of having their allowance terminated, and have to do menial chores around the house to try to feel, or at least look, useful. Where a boy child realizes before he is 10 that he is a failure and, at best, a second-rate human being (if not an object)(...) A society that is obsessed by the symbol of the womb--in which musical instruments, spaceships, means of transportation, weapons, religious ornaments, political regalia, and thousands of other things are designed to resemble the shape of a womb. A society in which men are scared, brutally scared, of walking around alone at night because almost any woman can physically overpower them and rape them with a sex toy. In which the most famous and influential philosophers of all time, the ones that get taught in university classes and whose books are actually bought and read and that influence the intelligensia, are all women, mostly women who loathe and/or misunderstand men and write things such as \"What is the cure for all of a man's problems?

It was all of these things when it was written, and most of them as recently as the 1970s, but for a modern reader, most of de Beauvoir's concepts and arguments fall into one of three categories:The first is the &quot;Well, DUH!&quot; category, in which she makes a large production out of an argument that has long since become generally accepted; only the most neanderthal sexist would still argue against the basic right of women to be treated on an equal basis with men in employment, or to be treated as, legally, an equal partner with their spouse in a marriage, for two of the most obvious examples. People may argue still about what exactly constitutes equal treatment, but almost no one would dispute the basic concept.The second category, and even more unfortunate, is the category of arguments which have long since been discarded as themselves sexist; for all of her attempts to be radical, she was still a product of her time, and rather a lot of ideas got past her internal screen. The most obvious example of this category is her blind acceptance of the claim, then popular among most gynecologists (which of course, at the time, meant &quot;most male gynecologists&quot;, since there were very few of any other kind) that almost all menstrual or pre-menstrual difficulties experienced by their patients had no physical cause, but were in fact caused by a psychological problem with accepting their femininity. De Beauvoir, of course, puts a more tolerant spin on this outdated claim, suggesting that it is only REASONABLE that women would have difficulties accepting the demands put upon them by society's reaction to their gender, but that doesn't change the fact that she accepts the basic premise itself, a premise that has long since been recognised (at least by feminists) as patent hooey. There are a great many physical causes of menstrual difficulties, and if there are occasional instances of neurotic triggers, that doesn't make the statement &quot;I can't find a physical reason for your problem, therefore there isn't one,&quot; an acceptable diagnosis.The third category of argument in this book, at least for the reader unschooled in existentialist psychobabble and/or marxist dialectic, is the &quot;WHAT did she just say?&quot; argument. In spite of claims to the contrary in the introduction, this book is rather heavy going for the reader not familiar with the catch-phrases and pet terms of those disciplines. Terms like &quot;immanence&quot;, &quot;transcendance&quot;, and such are liberally sprinkled throughout the text, and it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the usage. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but it does make the book rather inaccessible to the average reader.I do NOT recommend this book to the general public; for committed historians, particularly historians of the feminist movement, there is much to be learned from it. But for the general reader, it has long since lost the relevance that made it worth the effort to parse the 814 pages of impenetrable language.",

Terms are translated poorly, such as \"l'experience vecue\" (the lived experience similar to Husserl's life-world) being translated as \"Woman's Life Today\" (a slam), \"en-soi\" and \"pour-soi\" being translated interchangeably as in-itself and for-itself (they cannot be used interchangeably-they are not synonyms), etc. In fact, while the original work was published in two volumes, the English translation fits into one...because the translator cut some three-hundred pages that he felt were \"boring.\" The original French is lucid, direct, and quite beautiful. The reason that the book sounds so \"dated\" in English is because the man who translated it was. (He was a zoology emeritus with no background in philosophy). Thus, a lot is lost in the translation, and, since the publisher will not commence with a new translation for the sake of accuracy while the poor one sells so well (think dollar-signs), one could probably learn French and read the original writings first. \"The Second Sex\" (or rather \"Le Deuxieme Sexe\") is a good opening forum into what it is to be the Other, and the philosophical ramifications are just as relevant today as when the book was written.",

                "review/text": "I recently finished THE SECOND SEX by Simone de Beauvoir, which I had been \"reading on\" for more than a year. I adopted a system of reading chapters of it between other books after starting out great guns the summer of 2004, reading 200 pages and realizing that if I didn't do something to break it up, I would never finish it.That is not to say that THE SECOND SEX is not a great book. It is. It's valuable. It's interesting. It's educational, not just about views of women in the first part of this century in Western culture, but also about the logical and writerly process that de Beauvoir uses to address such a massive topic: The topic of Woman; the topic, really of Woman as Other.But there are issues with the translation that can't be ignored. If memory serves me, Parshley had trouble getting de Beauvoir to help him with his translation. Questions he directed to her went unanswered for months, so he not only translated the book, but cut large sections (yes, this 732-page version is abridged!) that he thought were not important, or were redundant. Parshley also was not a philosopher, but was a zoologist, and as such did not understand the depth of such existential and philosophical terms as \"immanence.\" Once the translation was finished and published, de Beauvoir was furious with the results. Though Parshley can hardly be blamed given the situation in which he was working, it does make one wonder how much what one is reading resembles de Beauvoir's original ideas and objectives.Considering her objectives, this leads me to one of my favorite quotes about THE SECOND SEX. Nelson Algren, the Chicago writer who was the longtime lover of de Beauvoir (with whom she traveled when she wrote America Day by Day; he was also the writer of The Man with the Golden Arm), said that when the book came out, there was much brou-haha, especially when 22,000 copies were sold in France the first week after it was published. Algren noted that de Beauvoir was the most reviled and the most beloved woman in Paris, and it was clear: \"She meant it.\"The book is quite logically organized, which makes it easy to pick up and put down (and to read bits of between other works). Part I: Destiny includes chapters on biology, psychoanalysis and historical materialism. The other parts of the book are: history, myths, the formative years, sitautions, justifications and toward liberation. De Beauvoir uses examples from myth, literature and doctor's case files to illustrate her positions. And her positions are more and less relevant today than they were in the 1940s when she wrote the book. The chapter on lesbians seesm less relevant, since she bases her understandings of the homosexual orientation on situational and envrionmental factors. However, I found her chapter on motherhood to be extremely cogent, as she deals with the issues of expectations of self-realization through children, the disappointments and the isolation of mothers, and the societal expectations of mothers of both girls and boys. And de Beauvoir notices the logical conflict between a society that lauds motherhood for women, but denies them a public voice and equal public standing. This is a typical style of argument for de Beauvoir, and I find her insight, her wisdom, her logic and her organization in this book to be impressive.De Beauvoir writes, \"One is not born a woman; one becomes one.\" I think it can be argued that she is not saying that female humans are born the same as male humans, because we all know, or are ourselves, people who were born with strong tradtional male or female traits inherently. Rather, after reading this large and complete work, I think she is saying that women are not born second-class citizens, they become them, through societal shaping, political pressure and self-monitoring. They become the Other because they start to believe they are. While I think we have made strides since THE SECOND SEX was written, reading this book nearly 70 years after it was written is a little upsetting: some of the saddest aspects of the life of the Other for women still ring true.",

Read more about it in \"The Second Sex\".)Anyone who dismisses the endlessly acute relevance of this masterpiece on human rights as \"outdated\" - particularly Americans who in 2004 still suffer rampantly archaic sexist issues with women owning the right to their own bodies or the idea of switching the governmental gender balance from a cluster of regressive males to progressive women - only airs their own fundamental ignorance regarding existential conditions for women in a world run by the women-hating male gender.\"The Second Sex\" makes for a painful read the intellectual content of which will not be outdated until the day we live in a post-patriarchal society - and that day wont arrive until we have reformed and modernised the male gender.

Indeed, there is rarely a \"true\" translation of a book, and opinions will always differ as to their quality. What I will say is that this book is infinitely better than the first translation, especially with its use of philosophical/existentialist terminology.I gave this book five stars because I think it is so much better than the original translation. Even though the translators may have made poor choices in parts, they have also restored a great deal of the book that was previously inaccessible in English editions. As to the criticism about the style of the book, I must disagree. I think the book is extremely readable, and had no trouble reading through in its entirety.Moving briefly away from the translation on to the content, this is a must have book for anyone interested not only in feminism, but also existentialism more generally. This book is for both men and women seeking to live an authentic (gendered) life. As a piece of history it is also important. Though the ideas presented her may no longer seem revolutionary, they were when this book was written. Of course, parts of the book have not aged well as science has advanced, but it does not detract from the greatness of the book.",

No where have I seen a more lucid discussion of oppression, as it occurs in the patriarchy of western society.What's more, the author does what many others writing on the topic fail to do: He effectively sets aside &quot;the blame game,&quot; reminding us that social forces are well beyond the reach of any individual's control. And that proves to be an interesting irony, as oppression is always about &quot;control.&quot;There are a few gaps in the book. Touching on some evolutionary psychology could have benefitted the discussion. (Although one could reasonably argue the author was clearly focusing on systems, not individual behavior; therefore, the discussion of the evolutionary psychology of individual behavior as it affects groups is perhaps outside the scope of this discussion). And the discussion of the history of patriarchy left out some critical causation, requiring the reader with no prior historical background to make some logical leaps.However, in the whole scheme of the book, considering everything he does cover so effectively and thoroughly, one can hardly argue with what he left out. Furthermore, his citations and his resource list are excellent. The reader can in fact get the additional background s/he might want to fill in the gaps almost entirely from the citations. There is only one book he didn't reference that I believe is equally essential reading about human behavior in the developed world, Robert Wright's _The_Moral_Animal_. Put these two books together in a Sociology curriculum along with some of their more notable citations, and we might just find ourselves creating a generation of enlightened people who appreciate not only that patriarchy is bad for everyone, male and female, but who will understand why and can start developing ways in which it can be replaced as the operant social system in Western Society.",

He states simply that we are all to blame if we do not examine how we live our lives. I know now that even though i'm a woman, i too was to blame. Patriarchy is bigger than all of us, and to say that Johnson hates men or is self-loathing is ignorant and only goes to prove the point of his book. If you have the chance to see him speak--do so.

In both his book and his lecture, he has a quiet assurity and clarity that is rare to find in the social sciences. He clearly lays out the underlying premises of our patriarchal system, showing how everything we live in is tied to it. What I liked best about this work was his discussion of &quot;Ghandi's Paradox&quot;; that is, nothing we do can matter, but it is absolutely essential that we do it, anyway. In order to change our patriarchal state, Johnson says, we must do what little things we can, instead of trying to change it all in gigantic strides. One person objecting to being a part of a nudie bar audience offers an alternative mode of behavior for others than the path of least resistance we all follow. That really made me understand how I could do my part to contribute to change, and made me feel brave enough to take part in it. I thank Dr. Johnson for doing his part and being brave enough to write this book, for I have seen firsthand what resistance he and the fighters for this cause must face.",

Having grown up female in a patriarchical family, and having had to spend decades of my life trying to work against myself and my anger to find a place in the world and a way to support myself and function in healthy relationship to men and children, I can appreciate that this book could do a lot to make the world a better place.",

I now recommend it to others for that reason, as well. Certainly the focus is on attracting the opposite sex romantically, but it is just as useful to people already involved in a steady relationship to maintain the romance in their lives. While I certainly found the observations Tracey Cox makes to be interesting, I found her underlying premises related to body language utterly fascinating.People who are naturally shy in potential dating situations certainly stand to benefit most from this book, but there is ample material for everyone to chew on. Most of her assertions seem to make complete sense, but a couple came across as a tad farfetched to me. Little matter: if any of her tips are true (and I believe the majority are) the book is completely worthwhile.The book is nicely illustrated, and generally well designed. I have to admit to being a bit put off by some of the multi-colored pages and unusual graphic design in several places which I think make it a bit more difficult to read than was really necessary. I also found it to occasionally be a trifle unorganized, sometimes to the point of needing to flip back and re-read sections. That leads me to my prevailing comment on the book: there is so much technique and information discussed here that I definitely do not feel that I have learned what I needed to from it the first time through. The book requires at least two readings to grasp the essential elements of what the author is trying to get across. I am not implying that it is a boring read (far from it), rather, that there is just a lot of information presented here.This book does truly help make sense of the actions of others. Whether in a steady relationship or not, this book is an excellent introduction to body language, and I recommend it.",

What this reader doesn't understand, however, is that any kind of social interaction is manipulation. If you are nice to people, if you show them &quot;serious&quot; feelings, you do that, because you believe that the others will respond to this in a corresponding way, too. But being &quot;nice&quot; in the face of adverse reactions is not moral, it's just plain stupid: if people liked your behaviour, they would be nice to you. If they aren't, i.e. if you don't get what you want, then you are doing the wrong things.And that's where the trouble starts with love (especially for &quot;nice guys&quot; as I had been for far too long a time): being overtly &quot;nice&quot;, accommodating, friendly, serious and unintrusive is equivalent to one thing that will hamper all your efforts of ever attracting a romantic partner: it is plain boring! Not to mention that it's a huge lie: nobody is always nice.I do love confident, attractive, intelligent, reliable and successful women. But I love them even more if they haven't lost this wonderful and delighting art of playfulness that can turn every man's knees into jelly. The choice between a &quot;giggling girl&quot;, and an uptight adult is very easy to take.Same for men: a relaxed, confident man with a great sense of humor who is still in touch with the &quot;naughty little boy&quot; within himself will always be chosen by the ladies. And they are right about that.One thing this book can teach you is to rediscover this playful child within yourself, which will flirt with and tease everything in sight - until stupid, uptight adults punish it for its love of life and &quot;teach&quot; it to be &quot;serious&quot;.The last thing you want to hear is people at your grave saying: &quot;Astounding, s(he) has never been so attractively playful!&quot;.

My normal modus would have been to later consider if she was interested in me, but this time I did the analysis in a couple of seconds and launched in where the opportunity appeared. She was interested.Before this book, my dating history was rich but totally dependant on perfect situations such as college or target rich side jobs during college (try working in concert halls...you can't believe) but I was never any good at cold stranger scenarios.

                "review/text": "It is symptomatic of the times that any criticism of feminist orthodoxy can only be delivered by a woman. Even then, any hint of allegiance to conservative politics is an automatic disqualifier. It labels one as a reactionary mouthpiece for the alleged forces of patriarchy. Fortunately, there are a growing number of young women challenging feminism's victim-cult politics. Unfortunately, contemporary pioneers for sanity in gender politics such as Rene Denfeld and Christina Hoff Sommers are not likely to get equal time - if they get any at all - in university women's studies departments.Equally so, Cathy Young, a regular columnist for the Detroit News and contributor to Reason Magazine, is not likely to hit the recommended reading lists of those with a partisan interest in the exploitation male female differences. As the title Ceasfire! suggests, the gender war has gone too far and, as Young exhaustively documents within its covers, damaged too many innocents.Says Young, &quot;Things were simpler a decade ago, when there were just feminists and anti-feminists.&quot; But today there are two feminisms. One is 'equity' feminism; that is simply the commonsense call for equal rights and opportunities. Young is solidly in this camp. No problem there, but its radical counterpart, dubbed 'gender' feminism, defines itself in warlike terms against male oppression. Proclaiming victim status for women leads to a hoard of injustices, not only against men, but nearly as often against women.Young doesn't suggest men and women are androgynous, but unlike suggestions of Mars and Venus, she places them both solidly on planet earth. They share substantially the same ability to wrong each other - and that they do. Chapter by chapter, myths which are promoted by feminism's fringe, but nonetheless widely accepted in today's political climate, are systematically exploded.Among these are the tenets of (I dare not say, but Young does) the battered women's movement. Young doesn't deny the existence of domestic violence, only that it can be a two-way street. As she points out, respected University of New Hampshire researchers consistently report women as often as men initiate aggressive physical contact - the so-called 'first punch.' This is a human problem, not part of the feminist declared &quot;epidemic of male violence against women.&quot; Mainstream media, as Young repeatedly reveals, either submerges, misreports or misunderstands these complicated dynamics. From there, legislation is enacted on false assumptions.By and large, gender feminism denies the inherent capacity for violence by women. Women's transgression are dismissed as reactions to an oppressive patriarchal world. Men are presumed guilty, both in feminist theory and in practical application of the law. But recent studies reveal that lesbians (presumably they are feminists) have high rates of violence toward their own partners.However, Ceasfire! is not an anti-women polemic. A chapter headed &quot;The Conservative Mistake&quot; points at the confusions attached to this issue. A paradox exists. Radical feminism posits that women are moral superiors to males, i.e., they would never file a false claim of rape, they have an inherent capacity civilize and nurture which brutish oaf men lack. Old fashioned Victorian morality agrees - so do some traditionalist conservatives. Women are the fragile guardians of good - a civilizing force - who must be placed on pedestals and protected.Young notes this &quot;strange convergence of radical feminism and patriarchal conservatism - and the alienation of both ideologies from real life.&quot; She points us to the confrontation between the Christian fundamentalist Promise Keepers and the National Organization of Women. Despite initial appearances as polar opposites, they both campaign on a platform of male irresponsibility. Unwittingly, they are working from the same premises.Another strand of conservatism, agreeable with equity feminism, points to the progress women have made in recent years. Here the belief is &quot;how ridiculous it is to talk about American women as an oppressed group.&quot; Indeed, there are statistics the National Organization of Women prefers to avoid.Young's conclusions are pragmatic. Her twelve proposals are directed toward balance, not vindication of any particular viewpoint. The theme is the de-politicization of gender issues, but one does not ask for balance unless the status quo is skewed, and Young is clear about that. We need to get along. Women have sons and husbands; daughters have fathers and brothers - our issues are family ones. We are the same species.But radical feminism cannot maintain its cohesion without an enemy. That is why Young's friend and colleague Christina Hoff Sommers once warned, &quot;When feminists quote statistics, reach for your common sense.&quot; The &quot;its always his fault attitude&quot; is the mantra of a movement that doesn't want peace. That is the balloon Young seeks to puncture.Popular media seldom probes for deeper truth. Whether that is due to political ideology, a lemming-like like tendency to follow the herd, or the rushed atmosphere of daily production, false and misleading examples of advocacy research are too often presented as authoritative. Its is a straight line from an interest group press release to the front page - once there, falsehood is elevated to truth. Young has produced a comprehensive counterpoint to the standard wisdom. She wants us to &quot;Get the facts straight.&quot; Ceasfire! is directed toward those who prefer truth and insight over perjury and manipulation.",

                "review/text": "We on the left have a tendency to make a hero of the &quot;victim&quot; whoever he or she may be. To do so, we need our &quot;reasons.&quot; We concoct statistics of victimhood, rely on our gurus (e.g., Catherine McKinnon, et al), usually avoiding decadent &quot;male&quot; critical thinking, to develop abstractions to prove the victimhood of same. When our findings are challenged, we throw flames at the straw person into which we've transformed the challenger, claiming most often that the challenge is of no merit because of the credentials, political affiliation, or alleged diabolical objectives of the challenger. As the challenges become more substantial, the flames become hotter.While the person who recommended the book to me is one whom I trust, I had some reservations about it as Young is affiliated with the Cato Institute, a conservative libertarian think tank. I was relieved to find that, while the book seems aimed at a conservative readership--there is a chapter dedicated to the mistakes of conservatives--by and large the book is a pretty safe analysis of contemporary feminists who are so dedicated to their status as victims that they've endorsed a veritable &quot;paleo-sexism&quot; as Young calls it. And this victimhood is, to me, the opposite of what feminism is supposed to be about! The feminists I've admired have insisted on claiming their own turf, on demanding their rights as citizens, not insisting that their rights are contingent upon their subservience to the omnipotent men.Oh, and Young had the audacity to acknowledge that women too abuse their kids--and their spouses--much more than many a feminist or court is willing to acknowledge. Thank you, Ms. Young. If a man were to say the same thing, he'd be accused of bitter cynicism. You've at least opened the door to that dimension of honesty.While I am a strong advocate of women's equality (and racial equality, and...) to the degree that most people from Cato would probably despise me, the present wave of feminists have infantilized themselves. That I do not advocate. Between some women claiming they've been &quot;sexually harassed&quot; on claims that are so abstract that if a man were to claim the same he'd be laughed out of court, and redefinitions of rape to ensure the place of comfortable women in the realm of the rape victim, there seems to be something wrong with the claims. (A Democratic congressman of my acquaintance was recently accused of abuse by his ex-wife. Her attorney implied that the charge itself, despite evidence, should be enough to convict him, or at least seriously challenge his reelection prospects. If I were in a position to do so, I'd have her disbarred!)Then there are the emotive statements, &quot;if such-and-such were a men's disease, its research would be funded,&quot; and the dubious studies by those catering to the latest feminist fads (many of which have been refuted by Christina Hoff Sommers, and others). Young does a pretty commendable job of exposing these fallacies. For instance, the amount spent on breast cancer has surpassed that of prostate cancer by a factor of 50, relative to the number of victims of each! And if I hear one more reference to Faludi's screed &quot;Backlash,&quot; I may get into book burning.Young is wise in covering some dimensions of the &quot;men's movement.&quot; And I agree with her approach. It seems that Warren Farrell, in &quot;The Myth of Male Power,&quot; may have a good point or two. But he seemed to want to make men into victims too. How about both sexes help each other out and not claim that &quot;other&quot; is subjecting &quot;us&quot; to unspeakable horrors. Then there is the bizarre and dangerous misconception that the &quot;us&quot; are our allies and the &quot;other&quot; our enemies. (Do such claims sell that many newspapers, or that much air time?)I suspect that a little of Young's speculation meets the needs of her ideology too; there is a little of &quot;it seems to me,&quot; or &quot;probably...&quot; But her closing recommendations as to &quot;get a life&quot; (my phrase, not hers) are sound. And I don't see anything wrong with women and men (blacks and whites; gays and straights...) working together. I have this wild fantasy that we'll be able to get something done if we learn to do so!What's more, I don't see the book as a cheap shot at feminism. (That's one of those flames, of course, aimed at Young). Rather, she exposes fallacies that need to be exposed if we are to work together, instead of against each other. While reading it, you might consider other victimologies, e.g., recovered memory, satanic abuse and other travesties, and ask where they correlate with victim feminism.",

                "review/text": "First of all let me assure you that there is nothing wrong with American women. There is something very wrong, though, why American feminism &quot;group-think&quot;, notably &quot;victim feminism&quot; (Oh, come on, is there *really* any other kind of influential feminism nowadays?). Which strikes me as very, very odd. Blame it on my European identity, cultural and otherwise, but the increasingly virulent rethoric of victim feminism makes absolutely no sense to me. It takes women who are born into one of the richest societies in the civilised world and clothes them in the garments of a Third World-esque &quot;oppression&quot;. The irony is, of course, that most of these women have not met with much oppression during their lives and that they have a world of opportunities open to them in a way undreamt to their ancestors, both male and female.Not that I intend to deny that the odd male chauvinist still exists, but to claim that the way to eliminate anti-woman attitudes is by encouraging anti-male attitudes is unacceptable in my book. And for anyone with more than a nodding acquaintace with moral and ethics, it is not only unacceptable, it is positively totalitarian. Another thing that I find intriguing (and I say intriguing to avoid the over-emotional conotations of &quot;downright angry&quot;) is this mindless connection of victimhood with power. I look at the real victims: at the Third World children who die of hunger in countries brimming with natural riches, at refugees that wait and wait for a peace that will never come, and wonder where does all this &quot;patriarchal oppression&quot; rethoric comes from. I have a little game to pose to those women who are bent on blaming men for their every personal shortcomings. I have a little game to pose to those men whose feelings of self-loathing are so intense that they have to rationalise them into that tiresome &quot;I am oppressive by nature, deserving of contempt, blah, blah, blah&quot; mantra: how about growing up into a full human being for a while? How about starting to assume full responsibility for your actions once in a while? Oh, I can sympathise with these trends. I can sympathise completely. It is easier to say &quot;We live in a society that oppresses women&quot; than to say &quot;If I do not develop my full potential it is my fault&quot;. It is easier to say &quot;I'm not being promoted because I am a woman&quot; than to say &quot;I'm not being promoted because I'm not qualified enough&quot;. It's easier to say &quot;I'm not violent, I'm a victim&quot; than to assume responsibilty for your bad actions and accept the just punishment. But ultimately, this is counter-producive. It is only a form of neo-paternalism.And what is so good about Young's book is that she sees this. She is able to see through all that screechy rethoric and poke at the deep truths beneath it. She knows that although there are certainly individual men and women who are victims of one thing or the other, neither women nor men are &quot;victims&quot; or &quot;oppressed&quot; or anything else. Real feminism was always about equality, about fairness for *all*, women and men, whites and non-whites, etc. It was never about moral superiority or claiming a privileged victim status. It was about realising how traditional sex-roles hurt both women and men, by imposing rigid behaviour rules and forcing them to follow expectations no one could keep. Where have those ideas gone? We live in a world of professional worriers. A bizarre world where people would rather distort the truth than to sigh in relief with the fact that, say, spouse battering rather than being a epidemic, constitutes unnaceptable and devious behaviour.It takes bravery to write such a book in contemporary America, although I think there would be much less fuss here in Europe. Only a woman could have gotten away with it, although Ms. Young still has to contend with the screechy no-brainers of (mostly) &quot;gender feminists&quot; whose hate-mail is protected by the very right to free speech they seek to abolish, simply for suggesting that men and women should work together to achieve common goals and that we should stop thinking about &quot;women&quot; and &quot;men&quot; and start thinking about &quot;human beings&quot;.Of course that such ideas, given the present thwarted state of gender politics, come across as revolutionary. To me though, a woman fed on a diet of real equality and critical thinking, to whom humanity consists in assuming your faults along with your virtues and accepting the consequences of your deeds, Ms. Young's ideas come across as solid, commonsensical sanity.",

And the fact that I completely applaud it probably makes me one in most anti-male feminist (male or female) minds.I personally do not understand how anybody could see anything in this book that has to do with promoting misogyny, rape, abuse, violence etc. In fact I challenge anybody to present one statement from this book that makes light of ONE of women's true woes. I defy anyone to state one provable lie i.e. untruth in all the facts Ms. Young has presented.The thought to me of all the critics of this book is that they had already made up their minds before they read it. I mean, if I discover that, truly, only 1 in 1000000 foxes die of human cruelty every year and publish fact this when the Protect The Fox organisation says 400 in 1000000 die using faulty methods of research, am I then anti-fox?! Likewise, if rape rates are lower than NOW thinks, is it &quot;pro-rape&quot; to make known the lower number?Tell me true, is it anti-woman to note that a father can often be just as good at taking care of the children as the mother? Is it anti-woman to tell the truth that a father is as important as a mother in a child's life? Is there any justification for the belief that a father is only as welcome in the child's life as the mother wants him to be? Is this not anti-child?Ms. Young deals with issues that have brought the sexes into conflict in the past thirty years, fueled by agenda driven people (you may accuse me of being a rapist here, if you like) who are more dedicated to an ideology than the lives of the women they claim to represent. The agenda driven people I talk of know that to admit that they have made progress means that they stand to lose their jobs so they continue to inject more venom into the relations between the sexes, causing more misery to all.Feminism has done many wonderful things, and I will move heaven and earth to ensure my wife's, sister's, mother's, aunt's, niece's and (especially) daughter's rights to equal opportunity, security, to pursue love and joy in their lives, but not at the expnense of my brother's father's, uncle's, nephew's and son's rights to the same.

Refreshingly, she does so not by appealing to our biology but to our intellect and sense of fairness. I was expecting 'can't we all just get along', and I got instead 'here is why we don't get along, and here are some strong reasons why we ought to be able to'._Ceasefire!_ is well laid out with each chapter gathering together a group of related issues and making a detailed examination of the prevailing viewpoints, statistical claims, and inequities (if any) that comprise the issue in the public mind. She turns the tables quite neatly on dozens of hypocrisies currently being put forth from many different camps, by no means picking only upon feminism. I can't say that her style is exciting but this, after all, isn't a novel; it's a serious, dispassionate look at issues that touch all of us every day.She ends the book with a listing of common-sense recommendations as to how we (both women and men) can and should stop and think before we start making claims of sexism, harassment and maltreatment. It is important to note that Young isn't any happier about spouse abuse, rape or the 'glass ceiling' than anyone else; she simply challenges us to carefully consider our definitions of these and other injustices. She does not minimize the achievements of women's rights advocates in the past, but her concern is for where we are today, and how we should deal with one another so as to live in amity. I found it especially interesting to read the reviews of the book in light of what Young has to say.Recommended, especially to those who feel almost certain they will disagree with everything Young is saying: if you do not find yourself seeing the merit in her viewpoints, you will then understand that much better why you dissent from them.",

This book offers a detailed and explicit exploration of the ways in which shared sexual use of women and women's bodies engenders, sustains, and nourishes such relationships in the Hebrew Bible. Hebrew Bible narratives demonstrate that women and women's bodies are not merely used to foster and cultivate male homosociality, male friendship, and toxic hegemonic masculinity, but rather to engender them and make them possible in the first place. Thiede argues that homosocial bonds between divine and mortal males are part of a continual competition for power, rank, and honor, and that this competition depends on women's bodies for its expression. In a final chapter, she also explores whether female characters in the Hebrew Bible use male bodies to form friendships and alliances to advance female power, status, and rank. The book concludes by arguing that women are essential to the toxic biblical hegemonic masculinity we find in the Hebrew Bible, but only because their bodies are used to make it possible in the first place. This book is intended for scholars of the Hebrew Bible, as well as advanced undergraduate and graduate students in religious studies, women and gender studies, masculinity studies, queer studies, and like fields. The book can also be read profitably by lay students of biblical literature, seminary students, and clergy.",

What is the \"inner woman\"?In this book, The Female Thing, Kipnis explores what it is like to be a women (in western culture, and particularly in the US) in today's society. Have \"we've come a long way, baby?\" Or, as Linda Hirshman claims in Get to Work: A Manifesto for Women of the World, are women continuing to miss the boat?Kipnis more or less issues a report card here: where are women now in regards to social status and equality? My interpretation of her analysis is that the report card would be a \"C-\".She looks at 4 primary issues that she calls Envy, Sex, Dirt, and Vulnerability.Envy: \"If you're a modern female, unfortunately something's always broken\" (p. 9). Women are obsessed, for complex reasons, about their \"imperfections.\" [Note: read I Feel Bad About My Neck: And Other Thoughts on Being a Woman by Nora Ephron for an example of this.] Kipnis summarizes this concept in her phrase \"...voluntary servitude to self-improvement\" (p. 10). There is a huge focus on looks instead of health, by the way. This commands women's attention to the detriment of other issues in their lives.Sex: Suffice it to say that women are told they don't need it, or they deserve more, or there are tricks of the trade that are either hidden from them or that fool them, or something! To borrow a title from Star Trek IV, sex for many women is \"The Undiscovered Country.\"Dirt: Your various \"apertures\" make you vulnerable to nasty things in life. Women in many societies take the major role in managing dirt (internal and external). \"Needless to say, being in charge of all the dirt has not made women particularly jovial\" (p. 91).Vulnerability; Kipnis' bottom line is that the \"custodianship of a vagina really is the female Achilles' heel...\" (p. 124). She discusses whether female anatomy is fundamentally vulnerable and perhaps \"overvalued\". Rape is the quintessential vulnerability, and she discusses the effects of sexual trauma (for example, experiences of Andrea Dworkin) in detail.And then the book ends! I really was expecting a concluding synthesis at the end of these four sections.All in all, this was a well-written, interesting discussion of the plight of many women in search of their various identities... as individuals, as members of family groups, and in societies. It is not a discussion of all the plights, nor all the opportunities. However, Kipnis focuses on the cages surrounding \"free women.\" I expect this book will be an interesting one to discuss in your local book club.",

                "review/text": "As a man, there were many parts of this book that caused me an eye-roll or two. But I had to concede by the end that I found \"The Female Thing\" to be an enjoyable and enlightening read on balance. Guys will be able to read this because it has ample doses of humor and doesn't take itself so deadly seriously as most women's books do. Kipnis examines four topics in women's culture (a term introduced to me by Kipnis herself, just what the heck is women's culture?) :Envy, Sex, Dirt and Vulnerability.Women want more. More of what, they are not sure but they want more of it; and men seem to have it, whatever it is. Power seems like a good thing to have and money seems to be the key to power so maybe women should get more money. But that just feeds capitalism and that can't be good (eww!) And if women earn more and men relatively less and women continue to rate men based on how much they make, won't women thus be denied one of the very things they've always wanted i.e. rich men? What women really want is not to feel inadequate. Or maybe just for men to feel inadequate too. Maybe if men started worrying about tummy fat and laugh-lines and their hair and using the right lotions and...wait a minute...metrosexuals... Never mind. Let's look at Sex.Women are faced with an uphill climb to sexual fulfillment, there are physical and social barriers to satisfying recreational sex. Or so Kipnis tells me. My own field research suggests that women who write books about women's sexual problems are over-thinking the thing but I will take her at her word (so to speak.) Then there is pregnancy and childbirth. The profound asymmetry between men's and women's participation and investment in procreation poses socially insurmountable barriers to an equitable distribution of rights and responsibilities. Only technological and legal changes can change outdated paradigms and...wait a minute...designer babies, family law crisis... Never mind. Let's look at Dirt.In what is by far the most readable section for men, Kipnis concedes what men have known all along: women are crazy. Okay, to be fair she offers a lucid examination of the economic, technological and social trends that have shaped modern women's feelings and attitudes toward hygiene and cleanliness and how those feelings and attitudes have presented an obstacle to women's equality (cukoo.) Kipnis fails to mention a well-known truth about the housework wars: A woman will be mad if her man does not enough housework, she will be ballistic if he does too much or does it too well or, worst of all, does it too publicly. Couldn't women ditch these images of feminine perfection and adopt a utilitarian mode of dress and hairstyle more like men's in order to...wait a minute...Rosie O'Donnell... Never mind. Let's look at Vulnerability.Kipnis wades bravely into the issue of rape (you didn't think she meant emotional vulnerability, did you?) Referring grudgingly to statistics, she goes on to talk about the fear of rape being a bigger issue than the actual incidence of rape. She lays out a wide range of what has been written by feminists about rape and the fear of rape that plays such a large role in women's lives and makes a deft observation: \"The opposite of desire isn't aversion, it's indifference...\" At what the author concedes is a Freudian (ergo discredited, outmoded) level, women are fascinated by the idea of surrendering to the powerful rogue archetype. (Hey, she said it, not me!) The upshot of decades of loud talk about the socio-political gender ramifications of the fear of rape is a raft of laws and rules that make every sidelong glance a potential train-wreck. Kipnis ends the chapter and the book with the following endearing sentence: \"A full accounting of the female situation at the moment would need to start roughly here.\" Some clever typesetting leaves most of that last page invitingly blank. It is simultaneously humble and defiant; I like it.Someday, anthropologists will discover a tribe that has no word or concept for gender. When visitors point out that some people have one kind of plumbing and some another, some bigger shoulders, some bigger hips, they will shrug as though the distinction were no more important than the shape of one's earlobes. They will have suitably elaborate mating rituals which allow the necessary mechanics to be glossed over while still allowing procreation. And we will set up discrete viewing blinds in order to make full use of this gender-neutral laboratory. Until then, we are muddling through and, for me anyway, Kipnis' subtext seems to be that we are making progress.As a man who likes women and wants them to be happy (along with everyone else) I hope so.Comments invited.",

                "review/text": "THE FEMALE THING is an irreverent look at the conflicted and contradictory female \"thing\" - that is, the female psyche. Achieving equality with and independence from the male of the species has been the goal for feminists for the last forty years, and while somewhat achieved, there is a sense of dissatisfaction, of things missing.At least for heterosexual women, men do have something that women want - the possibilities of love, etc. Apparently those needs have driven a tremendous consumption of advice and self-enhancing products and procedures, even among the most ardent feminists. Self-acceptance seems to be in short supply.Attaining financial independence by entering the workforce also has its problems: the loss of time and being subject to the rules of workplace regimes. Now in the name of empowerment, some younger women are opting for child-rearing - eschewing careers. The drive for equality and independence is indeed taking strange directions.Women are also conflicted over the nature of sex. According to the author the location of orgasmatic centers and the assignment of technical responsibility for achieving such is engendering debate among frustrated women. And then there's dirt. Women have been in charge of dirt ever since the rise of domesticity and men are generally oblivious. But the female anatomy itself has, through the centuries, been considered \"dirty\" by some elements creating no small amount of consternation even today.The author also considers the hysteria that can surround even the potential for rape, while acknowledging female vulnerabilities. She strongly questions a couple of well known feminists who have either forgotten their complicity in unwelcome advances or fabricated the same.Kipnis' appraisal of the female psyche, actually female sexuality, is intended to be provocative. Her writing is difficult, at times, to follow - just as in her other recent book, Against Love. But it's worth the effort. She forces a re-examination of issues that many may have thought to be settled.",

                "review/text": "This book is a valuable attempt to summarize the state of \"the female psyche...in the aftermath of second-wave feminism and partway to gender equality.\" After a brief preface, Kipnis explores the paradox of female compliance/complicity existing simultaneously with feminism's demands for equality. This exploration unfolds within four chapters, which compose what Kipnis calls \"a catalog of fetters, a chronicle of impasses.\"Holding a professorship in media studies at Northwestern University, Laura Kipnis is known for her aggressive humor and honesty regarding gender issues. Some reviewers, perhaps most notably Alexandra Jacobs in the New York Times, have criticized this book for its brevity and lack of theoretical density, but these critics are imposing inapplicable standards of judgment. An earlier book--Against Love: A Polemic--offers a way to understand Kipnis' intention in this new book. She is less interested in constructing an air-tight logical case than in using selective logic to reveal the ambivalence and indecision that many women feel about \"the female situation.\"The chapter entitled \"Envy\" offers a hilarious parody of the cult of femininity while still challenging the tendency to focus all female disappointments on men (as the scapegoats) and raising the possibility that feminism inadvertently aided \"scorched-earth labor practices.\" In \"Sex,\" Kipnis explores some willingly forgotten realities about the history of medicine (e.g., genital massage as a treatment for unhappy/depressed women). In \"Dirt,\" she shows how the cult of domesticity coupled with the association of home-and-body cleanliness with virtue traps women (and men) in a no-win situation.\"Vulnerability,\" the last and most controversial chapter, walks an argumentative tightrope. Kipnis argues persuasively that living with the constant awareness of rape inevitably shapes female behavior and psychology. On the other hand, she examines whether female victimization rhetoric is blinding many people to the possibility that \"as many men as women are probably raped every year in the United States, and possibly more.\" As Kipnis writes, \"Okay, most of these men are incarcerated at the time--but it's still rape.\"Armchair Interviews says: This book offers a provocative introduction to the debates percolating in many households and classrooms.",

                "review/text": "&quot;My husband says there's something wrong with me.&quot; &quot;I don't enjoy sex; I think I'm flawed.&quot; &quot;I'm afraid I'll lose him.&quot; A surprising number of women are plagued with varieties of sexual dysfunction and unhappiness. Sometimes the problems can be traced to certain traumatic events in their lives, but often the unhappiness stems from ignorance or an inadequate conceptual framework by which women (mis)understand the dynamics of their own sexuality. Sex therapist and practicing psychologist Linda Savage has written a book to help both women and men become more sensitive to the ways in which women are sexual, from their youth into their elder years.In Part One (&quot;The Wisdom of the Goddess&quot;) Savage critiques the prevailing western worldview of female sexuality and outlines an alternative way, the way of the goddess. Drawing upon ancient Sacred Marriage traditions from around the world, a deep appreciation-actually, a veneration-of feminine sexual and spiritual being (&quot;goddess sexuality&quot;) is described for the reader in lively, lucid prose. Savage emphasizes the life-affirming superiority of goddess sexuality through a fictional &quot;Tale of Two Daughters&quot;: parallel accounts of Inanna and Eileen as they come of age sexually. Innana is a representative of a woman-positive culture wherein sexual desire is a gift, whereas Eileen is raised in a conventional modern mind-set which has taught her that sex is to be hidden for its sinfulness. Savage's tale introduces the notion of three life stages through which women grow: Maiden, Mother, and Crone.Part Two (&quot;The Three stages of a Woman's Life&quot;) explores in more detail the characteristics of each of these three life stages. During the Maiden stage women are discovering their individual creative potentials in many areas of life; most important for Savage's focus is the emergence of &quot;a conscious relationship with intuitive body wisdom, which will continue for the remainder of life&quot; (p.58). It is a time of exploring sexual pleasure without the responsibilities of motherhood. Here, as throughout the book, Savage is careful to recognize that no single pattern of pleasure-preferences is to be considered requisite or even normative for all women. With the first pregnancy comes the Mother stage of accepting responsibility, as women are physiologically and psychologically transformed to elevate the well-being of their children above all other concerns. Savages gifts the reader with insights into the potent-albeit less conspicuous-sexual nature of the Mother stage. Her insights are particularly helpful for husbands, since the season of child-bearing and -raising leaves many men confused and frustrated about their wives' sexual desires. Passing beyond those years women arrive at the Crone stage, a time of sharing wisdom. Here Savage illuminates a widely misunderstood and unappreciated area of female sexuality. She characterizes the Crone stage as one of sexual empowerment, by which she means &quot;an inner confidence about your feminine sexuality that belies the physical image seen in the mirror . . .a state of awareness of the internal strengths of emotional compassion, focused will, and clarity of intention&quot; (p.154).In Part Three (&quot;The Power of the Feminine Way&quot;) Savage applies the concepts outlined in the first two parts in very practical ways to the actual circumstances women face. The organizing principle of her advice is body wisdom: learning deeply from one's own physico-psychic signals and sharing that knowledge with one's partner for enduring and thrilling intimacy. The reader will find in these pages directly applicable exercises and rituals to expand the erotic senses.Savage has written a genuinely helpful, reader-friendly book. Unafraid to share the story of her own life's odyssey, she exudes the compassion and commitment of the very life-stages about which she writes so well.",

I thought that this would be a book that would change the way I feel sexuality to more positive and open way and make me honour the feminine self even more.But as I read through the pages - and I did read the whole book trough - some things truly made me disappointed and sorry rather than positive and happy. Linda E. Savage surely is a sexual therapist, but why on earth all her examples about partnership were so exaggerated? Surely not all men like to give oral sex to their partner, but is it truly neccessery to tell, that some men even trow up after giving it to their wives? Does this help someone to overcome her fear of touching or in other senses help her feel better?Another somewhat irritating thing was naive attitude towards ancient cultures: sure sexuality was very differend and more open compeared to todays way, but how does the author know that &quot;when Inanna from Goddess culture four thousand years ago got her first menstrual period, all the women in her family gathered together to tell stories and give little presents to her&quot;. Surely this is all possible, but author seems to claim that life 4000 years ago was all happy and whitout any problems at all.I know this may be little bit of a hairsplitting, but there is a chapter talking about &quot;losing to Jennifer&quot; - that is, married man fells in love with young female outside his marriage. Author complains how much pain and desperate hope to feel young again this causes for elder women. This is with no doub true, but compared to this, it seems little weird that in the next chapter author praises older women who dare to take younger lovers! It seems unfair that the same thing - taking younger sexual parners - is acceptable to females, but forbitten for males!Book earns two stars for the Goddess- and women-positive attitude, that carries trhoughout the book, and for exellent sexual exercises, that were very interesting and inspiring.Generally, this is a good book for women, who, for some reason, have experiencet truly traumatic perioids in their life and who do not feel desire at all, or who for some reason dislike their body in sexual sense: however, I felt that normal, positive and sexually open person does not foud this book very helpfull at all.And finally, sorry for the mistakes in this writing, english is not my first language.",

The book went surprisingly quickly; the narrator's voice drew me in, and the plot stayed interesting throughout, since each section brought radical changes in Mira's life and cast of friends. It starts with her growing up in the 40's, getting married, having kids and becoming a (miserable) suburban housewife, but is punctuated with passages of the narrator philosophizing, and framed by a group of thoughtful, &quot;modern&quot; women sitting around in 1968, interrupting with &quot;but how could you have lived like that?&quot;--&quot;well, my house wasn't so different really&quot;--&quot;it had its good points too&quot;--&quot;aren't you glad all our relationships are more equal than those?&quot; [heh]. Plenty of reflection, along with close up individual perspectives. The high points glowed, parts forced me to put down the book for feeling sick or depressed, and there was no lack of wit and strong characters. A compelling story.Then there's the recurring theme of how women keep getting screwed over. The author's got a point, and it's actually a little hard not to hate men while reading the book, but she takes it too far. Somehow despite characters being round and believable, men always turn out to be insensitive, to put it mildly, and women a classic &quot;oppressed people&quot;. Real life is (I hope!) more fair. (These days, anyway. I'm also immeasurably grateful for the almost 50(!) years of societal change separating her birth and mine.)The evolution of the group of grad student friends struck a particular chord with me, as a recent college graduate. People change unexpectedly, relationships change, friends come together and fall apart, and when you look back there's no real pattern or meaning. As she put it, &quot;No, it's the little things that matter. But when you're dealing with a lot of insignificant lives, how do you put things together?&quot; It's trite at parts, and with an axe to grind, yes, but this book's got life.",

                "review/text": "This novel really opened my eyes. It was a mammoth and challenging read in the sense that it contained over 600 pages of unhappy marriages, unhappy lives, due to people who married out of tradition rather than love. Even the word love itself had a different meaning in this setting. Love between a man and woman apparently had nothing to do with respect or friendship. The relationships were degrading, unequal, unfair.I had to keep reminding myself that this was published in 1977, because frankly (I know this may sound naive), I was shocked at the illustration of Mira's childhood/college years/married years, as well as those of her contemporaries. I was moved by her descriptions of the ignorant and sexist attitudes of the middle class, of men and how they viewed not only women at large, but even their own mothers, wives, and daughters. One of the issues I had while reading this book was dealing with the fact that my own experience was nothing like this, nor was my mother's, nor was even her mother's.In any case, reading this made me feel so lucky to be a part of the present generation. It answered a lot of questions as to how the women's movement was born and evolved. However, it's so sad because you see this group of women: Mira, Val, Kyla, Clarissa, (not Iso--she knew she was different and therefore never expected to have a normal mainstream life, so she probably came out the least unscathed!), these women fought and clawed their way to a free independent life, only to find themselves hardened, wounded, bitter and in some cases, alone...because although they successfully changed their own lives for the better, society wasn't ready to accept this change in women, and wouldn't for another decade at least.Of course this is a novel about the women's movement, so I guess it's no surprise that every single man in this book is completely one-dimensional and shallow (with perhaps the exception of Mira's sons and Chris's friend Bart). I have to assume that this was the writer's experience even though it seemed extreme, unfair, and inaccurate. Of course, it wasn't hard to hate men who basically believed that raping his wife was his right, and that lesbianism was not to be taken seriously, or that women who want to do something other than take care of the home and raise kids were selfish, ridiculous or even crazy. The author was a master at creating this feeling.I think that Marilyn French also illustrates pretty clearly, that we all ultimately make our choices, and live with them. However, society plays such a huge role in how we decide. Society brainwashes from childbirth how one should live his/her life, and perhaps we need to think for ourselves a little more. It's our choice, do we do what society expects us to do? Or do we decide for ourselves, and deal with society's \"raised eyebrows?\" What's it worth?The narration was great. I like the fact that the entire experience was told in the third person, causing the reader to wonder, \"Who is this telling the story? Who is this speaking?\" To some it's obvious. To me, I didn't figure it out until the end. Oh well! Either way, I think it was necessary for the story to be told in third person, to maintain that sense of honest objectivity.Mira was a wonderful character: On a voyage of self-exploration, meeting all sorts of people who influenced her and taught her one aspect of life or another. Another strong character of course was Val, the ultimate martyr. She was almost too much to handle, but in a way her excessiveness forced people to see the corruption in the world. She had her classic flaws, but she was the true passionate voice of women, speaking only the truth, never accepting any less.There's a LOT of philosophical discussions throughout the book (what else would a bunch of brandy-drinking Harvard grad students talk about in the 60s/70s?!) The writing could easily provoke feelings of exasperation at Val's hatred, for example, her passionate disdain at the social \"norms.\" In addition, all the women, Mira, Kyla, Lily, Adele's blind acceptance of their religion, their parents' traditions, their husbands' behaviors, their passivity--is enough to appaul even the most understanding reader. But let's face it, I cared enough about these characters to keep trudging through the muck, and in the end, I'd say that this novel was profound. In 1977, it must've had a gigantic effect on our culture.",

However, I still found myself in Marilyn French's characters, sometimes more than any woman would want to. While this novel is at times certainly radical in terms of a feminist perspective, it remains frighteningly real for many women of the nineties. The situations are different, the causes not immediately related, but nonetheless still somewhat familiar in a disturbing way. For any woman who has felt the outrage at being a second-class citizen, whether it be by birth or by circumstance, this is a novel that provides validation without compromise. French does her fair share of male bashing, but for a novel written in the era that it was, it is somewhat understandable, if not expected. For those not yet accustomed to such forthright honesty, have some patience, for the message is valid even if the delivery is difficult. A! ! must-read for every woman who has had the guts to call herself a feminist. Marilyn French personified &quot;GIRL POWER&quot; before it was cool.",

I honestly never knew life was so difficult in the past for women, how bad things were, how futile it all was for women to rise above their &quot;status&quot; in the past. I was always raised to believe that I could achieve anything and be anybody. After reading this novel I realized that that wasn't always the case; had I been born thirty years ago I never would've had the chance to achieve all of my dreams...a chance I now have. I now understand why the feminist movement came to be, why the movement has not died and why it will NOT die. I think everyone who was born after 1977 (when the book was published) should read this book. It raised my consciousness, and I'm sure it would raise others, and maybe make people think TWICE before denouncing the feminist movement.",

Many of my contemporaries make such comments, and scornfully respond to my observations as being outdated &quot;feminist claptrap&quot;. We need to keep the memory of the way things were, in order to prevent them from ever getting that way again. We need to remember, and honor our foremothers, and those who continue the 'fight'.

I think that Marilyn French does a really good job with character development, and so caring for these gals is not all too difficult. Whether you agree with the ideas that she puts forth is unimportant. It does make you think about issues that are pretty much timeless, since I believe that the struggles of the women's movement in the 70's were not that long ago, nor have we made so much progress in this realm that renders these topics dated. Oh, if only that were the case!Throughout the novel, I found myself feeling many different things - pain, despair, annoyance, disgust, pity, boredom, sympathy, empathy, and at times, a total inability to relate, but many times, I put the book down to really think about either the issues that were being discussed, or to simply transport myself into these situations to consider what I would do in such cases.In the end, I had a lot of admiration for the women depicted in this novel, and ultimately, I felt inspired.

After reading this book, I find myself analyzing the marketing of male hygene products in prime-time commercials. I was also enlightened as to the impact homosexual culture has had on opening the door to male exhibition. This book not only helped me to understand my own place as a 21st century male, but it also helped me to understand the female perspective on the male body. Men have been looking at an acquiescent female nude in pop culture for so long that we fail to see the double standard.

It's become one of my absolute favorites. I've let at least 5 of my friends borrow it. (Or should I say I pushed it on them.)Obviously, I'm not as serious a reviewer as some seem to be, so bear with me.I caught this book a little late, a few years after it was originally published, but feel her comments are still dead on. I thought it was written very professionally, yet casual at the same time. I did not feel like I was being condescended upon, it felt like something \"we\" were discussing over a coffee.She starts off with a candid retrospective of sorts on her father, then changes direction entirely with the opening sentence in the following chapter: \"Becky Stone was the first of my friends to actually see one.\"Other topics include an analysis on media images, women's bodies, and of course, men's. A few of my favorite passages in the book include: the whole section on \"Public Images\", as well as \"Gentleman or Beast? The Double Bind of Masculinity\", \"The Sexual Harasser Is a Bully, not a Sex Fiend\" and \"Beautiful Girls, From Both Sides Now.\"Remarkably insightful, with theories and analysis that are hard to argue, her comments hit home and make you think whether you agree or not. I suspect even the most chauvinistic reader would have a hard time \"debating\" or \"disproving\" some of her thoughts and theories behind media images and the like, in my opinion. Sometimes I may not have wanted to \"hear\" some of things she had written but couldn't think of any retaliation.At certain times in the book, it felt as if she was poking around in my head, most of her thoughts about the male body and men in general congruent with my thoughts about myself!An exciting topic by itself, I highly recommend this book for anyone curious about the male body. You will finish this book smiling, perhaps even with a change in the way you look at yourself, or the culture around you. (I constantly find myself looking deeper into what is given and shown to us than I did previously.) There will undoubtedly be times during reading where you will stop, needing to discuss what you've read with your friends! At least I did. :)I don't think there are any bad parts to this book, but some might find certain parts uninteresting. That's a given! To me, that doesn't qualify as bad. I think everyone who decides to buy this book will be talking after they put it down, regardless of how much you loved it. 5 stars!",

If you're an academic, it's not super driven by theory or a desire to be &quot;science,&quot; and if you're looking for something fun to read about the male body it's probably a little academic for you. But if you're looking for something in between, something written by a very smart social analyst that doesn't talk about Foucault or quantitative data on every page, then this is a good choice.I have to say that the chapter on men and women's bodies was a little bit of a let-down. On the one hand, it's a really good idea of a thing to think about, but on the other hand, I kind of disagree with the strength with which she argues that men really do want only skinny women. I'm just not sure it's true, and this is an area in which a little more empirical rigor might have been to her benefit. But that's a minor quibble, and as a whole I really liked the book.",

Thus, in Bordo's words, what we see in the twentieth century &quot;is the recognition that when we look at bodies (including our own in the mirror), we don't just see biological nature at work, but values and ideals, differences and similarities that *culture* has 'written,' so to speak, on those bodies.&quot;What is most compelling about Bordo's work is that she extends her analysis beyond the media and extends it to literature, history, and various institutions that influence our ideas about the male body. She shows overall how myths about the male use sexist images that have been used against women for years. She does this using very lucid, insightful, and humorous writing.",

Women learn to love and appreciate themselves even with warts and blemishes. They learn self-healing, of shallow wounds, deep wounds of the heart, emotional wounds and most importantly, self-acceptance. Women who have gone though battles need more self-love and appreciation for the sccars they carry. Self-inflicted doubt, criticism, fear and comparison have wounded women; &quot;Embracing your wisdom and wholeness&quot; are words women should be hearing. Women need to see beyond her outward appearance and be encouraged to look inward to the real beauty beneath her skin. Women are wounded by society's standard of womanhood, the &quot;who&quot; &quot;what&quot; and &quot;how&quot; women should look, act and express themselves. The twenty stanzas of the poem are aimed at each need, each scar, and each offers, a reassuring of a woman's self worth. All women should read this book, especially women who have gone from child to adult because of incest, abuse or rape, all women who have been scared from disease or injuries. Emotional scars of neglect, reminders of past mistakes, all will be turned into positive bandages of healing by reading the poem over and over again, by using it's advice and suggestions on forgiving, toughing and healing your own body. Patricia Lynn Reilly appreciates the wonder and beauty of all women. She helps us to see, as we should, the whole woman, her body, her mind and her soul, the character of a woman. &quot;Imagine a woman in love with her ouwn body. A woman who believes her body is enough, just as it is. Who celebrates her body's rhythms and cycles as an exquisite resource.&quot; As you gently breathe in this affirmation, believe you are this woman and you will be.",

                "review/text": "Elizabeth Plourde's book contains the \"informed consent\" that I deserved, but did not receive prior to undergoing my total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy 15 years ago, at the young age of 35. At the time of my surgery I was a vibrant, happy mother of two and actively practicing registered nurse.My physical and mental health deteriorated immediately post-operatively. I knew that I was \"not the same\" person as I lay recovering in my hospital bed. The physical changes were noticable within the first few days of recovery. Like Elizabeth, I also struggled with bewildering acute depression, hormonally induced physical aches and pains and anguish over the loss of my former glorious, God-given, sexuality as the immediate post-operative months progressed. Even today,15 years later, I still struggle with adequate hormone replacement.The horrific physical and mental anguish I experienced led me to my own research postoperatively. Within 4 years of having this surgery, I successfully sued the doctor that performed it. The foundation of my suit was based on the lack of informed consent about the well documented long term negative consequences of being castrated. I settled my suit out of court for a substantial sum of money.I encourage any woman contemplating this surgery to read this book and seek alternatives at all costs. Elizabeth's frankness and honorable, well-documented research may be offensive to some women. But, if her book, YOUR GUIDE TO HYSTERECTOMY, OVARY REMOVAL, AND HORMONE REPLACEMENT:WHAT ALL WOMEN NEED TO KNOW, helps one woman to avoid the reality of unnecessary mutilation the book is worth it.Nancy Thomspon RN, BSN",

My first visit with my new M.D. became less costly and more productive as a result.Two months of topical bioidentical progesterone-$10 per month from Womens International Pharmacy-and I returned to my tennis loving ob/gyn for a recheck. The hemorrhaging and hair loss had ceased, but the fringe benefits made me the office marvel. The left ovariean cyst was gone, the septation on the right ovarian cyst disappeared, the right ovary need not be removed , and uterine fibroids showed a marked size reduction, as did my distended abdomen.Good information, good questions, courage and carefully chosen doctors and healthcare providers create miracles.

I appreciated the honesty of the book and it helped me to make my decision to have my hysterectomy. I never felt the author was against the procedure, only against unneeded surgery. The book might have been more careful about establishing the fact that hysterectomy is indeed necessary sometimes and perhaps it could have been more respectful of women's choices and fears; at the same time, &quot;Your Guide&quot; does show that hysterectomy is no &quot;walk in the park.&quot; It's tough and no one should undergo the procedure unless she needs to. If a woman is told she needs a hysterectomy, she needs to do her homework and, if necessary, get another opinion. Hysterectomy is not a simple operation, it is major surgery, and it is a life-changing surgery. This book is very clear about that. Readers need to put the book into the context of their own experience, and if they do that, they will likely find the book useful.",

I completely disagree with earlier post about \"scaring\" women unnecessarily- the information in this book is real, solid and based on the most current medical research out there.As a woman who underwent a completely unnecessary hysterectomy and oophorectomy based on a misdiagnosis from an outdated doctor, I cannot stress enough, the importance of being fully informed of all possible consequences before consenting to any kind of surgery.I myself have suffered horrendous side effects, some of them life threatening and all of them life altering. My quality of life has been significantly impacted and I am certain that had I read this book before my surgery, I would not be in the position I am now.For several years after my surgery, I was passed from one doctor to another who seemed to share the same opinions of the doctor who reviewed earlier. Then I read this wonderful book (and also \"The Hysterectomy Hoax\" by Dr. Stanley West) and began my quest to find more enlightened doctors.My quest ended with wonderful, world renowned doctors who totally validated the information in this book and have done their best to help me recover as much as possible from the harm that came to me from outdated, misinformed, medical practices that are, unfortunately the \"standard level of care\" in the USA. (Hopefully, as the truth is brought out into the open, this will change.)What happened to me is NOT rare, it is much more common than we are led to believe and the chances of this happening to you or a woman you love is very high. Therefore, I would put this book at the TOP of my reading list for all women.As for the comment about the \"mind/body connection\"...I couldn't agree more. But in order for the mind to connect with the body, it needs the neuro transmitters to work, and those need chemicals from the body. ALL the chemicals (hormones) from ALL of the body!

It makes excellent points about how \"sexual liberation\" really led to a lot of our girls getting used and tossed out and it doesn't speak much for our boys either if they are the ones doing it. And maybe some of the boys are getting used and tossed out too. Hey, a lot of parents fear for their children when they turn on the TV and see genital herpes treatment ads all over.The section on fertility is also not PC, but sorry to say it is true. Women may have a lot more opportunity but that just doesn't change biology. Read this while you are young because you just cannot deny that you are less fertile at 40 than at 25. I wish the author had mentioned that when older women have to use fertility drugs due to late pregancy it often leads to multiple births of babies who are born premature and this is a heartwrenching situation for babies and parents alike. Remember NOW's outrage at the fertility awareness campaign in NYC? The problem was brought forward by fertility clinic workers noticing how many women were coming to them thinking they could get pregnant in their upper 30s-40s-50s, only to find out they had missed their chance. NOW's reply was that \"women don't need anymore reminders about their fertility slipping away.\" Apparently they do. Why is NOW trying to deny fertility facts to women?Other points that were very interesting were commentary on the \"wage gap\" (contrary to popular belief, the wage comparisons to do not compare men and women in the same jobs. They compare OVERALL earnings. Women do not make as much overall because many take lower paying jobs that are more flexible, leave the workforce for a while to have babies-some for many years-and have interests in fields that don't pay as well (ie: elementary school teachers.) The author also points out that a lot of women out there only work because they have to (Although don't forget a lot of men only work cause they have to, too!). Sorry, no matter how hard feminists try, there are still millions of women who want to raise their own children. Not eveyone, of couse, some people love to work. But hey, don't feel bad about yourself if you like to stay home and take care of your family. Consider youself privledged to be born a woman and get the opportunity to stay home. Men carry a heavy responsibility to support their families in one-income families. This book will assure you you are not \"weird\" if you are a woman who wants to stay home and take care of a family and feel you are missing nothing by not working.It is hard to sort propaganda from fact, but really I thought this book was well balanced. It listed plenty of facts from the left side. It certainly didn't omit the finidings of studies that didn't agree with author's right-wing preference. It doesn't tell you your kids will end up horrible if they are in daycare or that you are a horrible woman if you work. It even states that childbirth is more risky than abortion in terms of mortality for women! This book is not trying to hide stats that the left uses.The women's movement has done some good things. I love being able to vote. It's done other good things, but it's not perfect by any means. This book just encourages you to look at the facts and not just blindly follow a group that has \"women's rights\" in the title. If you really look at all the agenda, you will see that some of the things are really anti-woman, anti-men, anti-child and anti-society too.",

                "review/text": "One of the major reasons why radical feminism remains such a destructive influence on the lives of Americans is that it claims to speak for women when it really only represents a minute percentage of them. The feminista activist has proved quite adept at obscuring this fact by labeling their critics as \"patriarchal, anti-woman\" and \"sexist.\" The irony lost on many is that no social movement in history has so thoroughly undermined the constituency they pretended to represent.As always, the opinions of males are discounted, and whatever words men write are deemed compromised, so let us be grateful that Carrie Lukas came along. She is an equity feminist in the mold of Christina Hoff Sommers and Daphne Patai, and what many readers already know is that equity feminist is to gender or radical feminist what the Green Berets are to terrorists. Lukas's new book is an insightful answer to the pervasive lies so often told about men. Her main theme is that differences between the sexes exist, and there's no reason to label them as good or evil. Viva la difference should be the order of every day. By the end, you'll be pleased that she took the time to pen such an eloquent refutation of the alleged, and fictional, patriarchy.Lukas rationally cuts through the lies and distortions which so poison our ether. You'll find skillful refutations to canards like men being the primary cause of domestic violence, that divorce is beneficial to women, and that being born with a particular kind of genitalia enables one to \"have it all.\" The real problem with gender feminists is that their need to dominate and control others is far more important to them than their supposed goal of bettering the lives of women. Behind their hysterical passion hides a collective of dominatrixes. The only thing that their politics uniformly promote is an increase in their own status and increased feelings of self-righteousness.On aggregate, Lukas's narrative voice is outstanding as she is the possessor of an analytical and dispassionate mind. In my opinion, she even provides a more balanced assessment of radical positions than they actually deserve. The only negative thing I can say about this book is that I suspect few women will read it. My guess is that this is due to its not being feel good or warm-fuzzy enough for them. What those who habitually avoid the non-comforting forget is that knowing the truth is an end in itself, and that a hard chair made of wood is still more soothing than one made wholly from imagination.",

                "review/text": "The title of Gilman's novel may be a bit misleading. The novel is described as a feminist novel. Yet, this is not exactly acurate. The absence of men in the utopian society may seem extreme to some, and it is. This is how Gilman makes her point. She does not create a world without men because men are terrible creatures who have corrupted the world. The utopia which lacks men is a clean peaceful place, excelling in every way American society fails. But, it is neither the absence of men nor the presence of women that faciliates this.Gender, in this novel, is symbolic for the most part. Gilman does separate the two genders to destroy steroetypes, but also to establish a concrete difference between the two worlds. The male world is not bad, and the female good. The world in which people are defined by others and limited to these defined roles is bad, while the world in which people are free to grow without being defined or compared to others, and are able to see the oneness of all people is good.Comparing Herland to the reader's own world, Gilman begins destroying gender based stereotypes. Because there are no distinctions of gender in Herland, nor any superficial characteristics which accompany gender, Herland women take on the roles of all people without considering any limitations. These women are strong, agile, nurturing, intelligent, cooperative, and able to rely on themselves. They are not &quot;typical&quot; females. As Gilman explains through the male character Van, &quot;Those 'feminie charms' we are so fond of are not feminine at all, but mere reflected masculinity--developed to please us because they had to please us, and in no way essential to the real fulfillment of their great process&quot; (59). In the same way, stereotypes about men can be discredited. Such ideas have been made up to help people deal with the differences between men and women. Gilman shows the reader that if people stop basing their identities on what others want, they will no longer be slaves to limitations. They will be free to discover their true selves and will allow others to do the same.Gilman shows readers that men and women are distinct people, but reminds us that they are people first. This can be seen when Somel, a woman of Herland, innocently questions a male visitor, &quot;But surely there are characteristics enough which belong to People, aren't there?&quot; (89). Focusing more on these characteristics, those belonging to &quot;People,&quot; allows humans to fulfill their personal potential without fear of jealousy. The women of Herland are able to live in &quot;such universal peace and good will and mutual affection&quot; (99) because &quot;they lacked the sex motive and, with it, jealousy&quot; (99). The women of Herland are free and equal because they are secure enough in themselves to offer and accept help for a joint cause, the betterment of their world. All readers, men and women alike, can learn a great deal from this humanist utopian novel.",

Women in Herland, a place where women are stereotypically all longing for no more in life than to reproduce and pop out babies, are expected to produce no more than one baby each, due to limited resources and land. Any woman who posesses personality traits that do not fit the rigid framework of Herland society, are point blank asked not to reproduce. It is made clear that any personality trait outside of the societally-desired norm of unrealistic goddess-like calm, reserve and mommy-ism is undesirable. Therefore, they &quot;weed out&quot; any differentiation and individualism, establishing a clone-like state of &quot;We're so pure we float&quot; women.The narrator of Herland is Van. He and his two buddies have gone exploring the myth of Herland and landed by plane just there. Exercising a stereotype that doesn't seem to fit, three beautiful, young women are sent out to act as sirens, and lure the men. The problem with this part of Gilman's story, is that supposedly the society has not had any knowledge of or contact with men for thousands of years. How then would they know that men would be so attracted and play chump to this lure? --Be that as it may, again, we see Gilman using women and basing this on the stereotype that young women are to be used as jezebels, temptresses, while the older women are naturally the wise ones, described as &quot;the colonels&quot; by the men in jest. Second female stereotype: A mature woman is a crone. She is not attractive to men, but does have wisdom and authority. Of course there are no young, attractive women on the council of &quot;colonels&quot;. Young, pretty women are of course, flighty and stupid and not in positions requiring wisdom and authority (read: sarcasm).Van and his two fellow-explorers, Jeff and Terry, are apprehended by being rushed by women and anesthetized with ether. Does this say &quot;Peaceful Utopia&quot; ? I didn't read it that way. The men are imprisoned and guarded. They are forced to tutor the &quot;colonels&quot; in English and to learn the parlance of Herland, so that they might better communicated with the colonels and be of more use to their self-concerned purposes. It is apparent that the men want to leave and go home. They attempt to escape. The women spy on them from the treetops, unknown to the men, almost toying with them this way. They observe them, hungry and desperate and wanting to go home. When the women's curiosity in observation is satiated, they drag the men back and double up on the guards. The men are held prisoner in Herland for about a year. This imprisonment of human beings for personal experiment/education in sociology circumvents Gilman's attempt to paint a picture of a superior society.In closing, getting through Herland was a labor, not of love, but of college course assingment. I found these women to reflect stereotypes about women (all women love cats, all women want to be mommies, young women are temptress-sirens, mature women are wise old crones) and other unlikable traits: eliminating indigenous animal and plant life that they made judgements about, tampering with ecology. I also thought the three men were very narrow-minded-ly created compilations of male stereotypes. It was all I could do to even finish reading this book.",

                "review/text": "Charlotte Perkins Gilman was arguably the most important American author of the women's movement in the early 20th-century. In addition to editing a newspaper, &quot;The Forerunner,&quot; she wrote &quot;Women and Economics,&quot; one of the first studies of the role of women in the economic system. Gilman also wrote a number of utopias: &quot;Moving the Mountain&quot; in 1911, &quot;With Her in Ourland&quot; (1916), and her best-known, &quot;Herstory&quot; in 1915. In &quot;Herstory&quot; Gilman creates a homosocial (one-sex) utopian society made up entirely of women in which the culture, political system, and families are the result of having women as the basis (instead of merely stemming from the absence of men). However, while other American utopian novels, most notably Edward Bellamy's &quot;Looking Backward 2000-1888,&quot; were standard reading for decades, Gilman's &quot;Herland&quot; was pretty much forgotten until it was rediscovered in the 1970s. Even after four decades Gilman's satire was seen as still speaking to the conditions faced by American women.Following the conceit first used by Sir Thomas More in writing his &quot;Utopia,&quot; Gilman's &quot;Herstory&quot; tells of three American explorers (male, of course), stumbling upon an all-female society in an isolated mountain valley in a land far away on the even of the first World War. Since they find this strange land to be civilized the explorers are convinced there must be some men hiding someplace, and set out to find them. As they search high and low for the male of the species they learn about the history of the country, the religion of motherhood, and the other unique customs, while trying to seduce its inhabitants. Many generations earlier the women had found themselves separated from the human race, with the men dying off. The society evolved, organizing itself around raising children and living in harmony with their surroundings. In the end, the three mail visitors end up falling in love with three of the women and are essentially converted as naturalized aliens.&quot;Herstory&quot; is less science fiction than many of the utopian novels written during this period, and clearly its primary value is in terms of its provocative commentary on gender roles in the United States in the early 20th-century. Not surprisingly, Gilman questions the roles assumed by men and women in the &quot;bi-sexual&quot; society by showing the relative perfection achieved in Herland with its uni-sexual society. What Gilman sidesteps, of course, are the issues of sexuality: the women of &quot;Herstory&quot; are asexual beings, although they are capable of parthenogenesis (asexual reproduction). Also, by talking about these women as being descended from good Aryan stock she raises the specter of racism as well. But clearly Gilman's purpose is to provide a critique of the social order of the day, using humor as a way to mask her telling barbs and to provide her unorthodox views of gender roles, motherhood, individuality, privacy, and other issues. Then there are the parts where the inhabitants of &quot;Herstory&quot; are amused and horrified to learn about the conventional aspects of courtship, marriage, families, warfare, labor relations and even animal husbandry in the &quot;real&quot; world.Because &quot;Herland&quot; is essentially a novella, running only 124 pages in this unabridged Dover Thrift Edition, it is fairly easy to work it into a class looking at 20th century American utopian literature or the women's movement. In many ways, although it is not as well written, &quot;Herland&quot; is a much more provocative critique of women in American society than Margaret Atwood's &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; or Marge Piercy's &quot;Woman on the Edge of Time.&quot; &quot;Herstory&quot; also stands out because it is a true utopian novel, written at a time when the dystopian emphasis was about to redefine the genre of utopian literature.",

                "review/text": "Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Herland (Dover, 1909)I always found it odd that Gilman, a prolific writer during her life, had become so obscure less than a century later as to be remembered for only a single short story, \"The Yellow Wallpaper.\" Now, having had the distinct displeasure of having read a second piece of Gilman's writing, I have to wonder if that obscurity isn't well-deserved.Herland is everything that \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" is not. It is boring, overly expository, dry as dust, and most importantly, didactic. It is didactic in the same way your history teacher who spoke in a monotone is didactic; you end up hating the delivery so much that whatever's being said gets tuned out along with the noise. It doesn't help that Herland is a vastly inferior knockoff of such nineteenth-century fantastic-journey novels as Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, James DeMille's A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder, or Doyle's The Lost World. All three of those novels had the same generally socially conscious bent as does Herland, and held up a dystopian land to our own to show us where our own civilization is lacking. But all three of them (even Poe, who despised the novel form and never wrote in it again) had a basic understanding of the structure of the adventure novel and how to keep things moving while passing along their message about what's wrong with society. Gilman lacks this facility, and what's worse, she's of that strip of author who feels that, in order to make sure the message is clearly heard by the reader, she must go out of her way and add a clarifying sentence. After all, the reader is far too stupid to pick up on inferences.The popularity of The Yellow Wallpaper and the obscurity of Gilman's other work cannot, of course, be dismissed as understood after reading only one of her other works. But Herland certainly doesn't have me straining at the leash to go looking for anything else Gilman wrote. Uniformly awful. (zero)",

                "review/text": "Obviously, many people who read this book -- including most of the reviewers here -- clearly misunderstood Gilman's tone and objective in writing \"Herland.\" The purpose of the book is NOT to say that women are better than men in every aspect of life, or that women can survive without men. Indeed, the inhabitants of Herland realize that without males, their society is incomplete, which is why the three young women are encouraged to court the three male visitors. Gilman portrays two of her three male characters sympathetically and intelligently, and even the chauvinistic one is portrayed as intelligent, just misguided.Gilman has two purposes, neither of which is to show the 'inferiority' of men. One, she wishes to show what a society would be like if everyone were treated equally. Two, and related, she wishes to show what society were like if people put the greater good above their individual goals. In that sense, Gilman's society is not socialism but more like anarchism -- there IS no central government; Herland operates like a large utopian family, in which everyone's role is equal and everyone has a very important role in society. No one's role is more important than any others, be they male or female.The reason for the Herlandians' physical besting of the men is to show that women are only 'weak' because they are sheltered, and in turn are sheltered because they are weak; also, while the Herlandians were natural women living in the natural world, the men are essentially 'sheltered' by technology (all of them being specialists in an area) and thus are not physically trained as the women are. It's like a female Olympic runner beating a male who runs for his college in his spare time.Of course, the book has flaws -- the utopian society of course, is without chink or problem, and Gilman ironically venerates traditional aspects of women, casting them into the stereotype of communal, compassionate, sacrificial mothers. The veneration of 'motherhood' almost religiously is hypocritical, as if every woman desires to be a mother. Predictably, no woman in the history of Herland seems to have a problem with denying self for the greater good, or the lack of tradition, or the taking away of her own children for communal rearing. For that, I have to say that Gilman -- while trying to deconstruct the typical notion of a woman -- inadvertently BUILDS it by assuming that all women have these characteristics naturally.",

Through some miracle, one woman becomes parthenogenetically pregnant - without normal fertilization - and civilization is rebuilt.But without men.The story opens 2000 years later, after the culture has flourished and stabilized, when three men of very different temperaments arrive. This brief story sketches the Edenic society. The women have their entire country under the most intense cultivation, and it is lush and productive. The women have a stable population, and a rich culture built around progress, peace, and single-minded devotion to the creation and care of the next generation. That is the cental axis of Gilman's world. Religion and everything else revolve around that.The women themselves, through Lamarckian and social evolution, have become strong, wise, happy, and oddly sexless. They seem not to have discovered the happiness of physical affection, especially when separated from procreation. I find it odd that there is not even a hint of that physical intimacy in this otherwise attractive world, even though the women could easily share it between themselves.Of course, one of the men commits an outrage, and they are banished back to the evil outer world - Eve casting Adam out of the garden, this time. Nearly nothing is said about the economy of this world, and just a little about their system of justice. As utopias go, it's a bit one-sided and bland, with one chilling exception. In the very last sentences of the book, there is a hint that their justice can include capital punishment. It would be carried out by overdose of anesthesia, a 1915 prediction of today's \"lethal injection.\"//wiredweird",

What makes this book most interesting is its artifact status in the evolution of feminism.Most modern-day feminists would, I believe, be horrified to be plunked down in Herland to spend their lives: a world without coitus, where motherhood is the end-all and be-all of a woman's existence. There is no Sapphic hanky-panky going on among the inhabitants of this uterine utopia; the very concept of sexual pleasure is foreign to these ladies. Where feminists once wanted motherhood without sex, today they are more likely to want sex without motherhood.In addition, Herlanders are unabashedly pro-life and horrified when the idea of abortion is raised. A woman's right to choose is as unthinkable in their world as a topless bar would be.On the other hand, there is plenty of it-takes-a-village-to-raise-a-child; every inhabitant of Herland is a career woman; and when the men raise the issue of their wives taking their names, the brides-to-be scornfully refuse.As a political manifesto, Herland cannot be taken seriously in the modern world, yet it maintains its importance both as historical artifact, illuminating the thought of the early 20th century, and as evidence that -isms are not static but constantly evolving.",

So, when 3 young American men in the novel encounter a country comprised entirely of women, they look everywhere to find out where they must have hidden their men. Of course, being emperialist men, they think it should be easy to conquer and subdue a country of women. However, they are looking at these \"women\" through the eyes of their own culture, not realizing their full potential as \"humans\". These are women who have such little land to support their people that they've only kept and cultivated food-bearing trees like most people would cultivate a garden and who have learned how to have children without men. Some women! Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote this novel after leaving her own husband and home, going off to prove that women are as capable as making a living for themselves as men are. I can only imagine the stir this book must have caused among the feminists of the day. Gilman has written a very interesting book with only one minor flaw. She keeps on building the reader up to this \"big thing\" that the women of Herland evidently have in store for the men who have dropped by bi-plane into their perfect little world. It turns out to not be such a shocking thing after all and pretty obvious in fact. Despite this slight transgression, the book is superb. HERLAND is a short book that is surprisingly quick-paced and imaginative. It's a gem of a book to add to anyone's collection.",

                "review/text": "It's common wisdom to think of the Feminine Mystique as a classical feminist text. This is perhaps the case, but I would like to argue that it is so much more than that. The book examines what society tells women about their lives -- education, career, family, sexuality, goals, values, and anything else. The book discusses what society tells women, who exactly promotes these views about femininity, out of what possible motives, and what toll do these views have on women, their family and their children. The basic thesis of the book is that femininity has been mystified, manipulated, and taught back to women, in their homes and schools and churches, in the novels and magazines they read, etc -- that this mystification of femininity is a monsterous distortion of a person's life, resulting in emotional problems, marital and family tension, stifled careers, and general unhappiness... That we -- society -- have been living in denial of the condition women have been manipulated into, and therefore have been ineffectual in our help. That there are good reasons why things are the way they are -- it's embarassing to discover just how economically profitable this distortion is.The Feminine Mystique is profound and penetrating in that it questions a state of affairs so many of us take (or have taken) for granted. The book appeals to reason. You won't find any &quot;masculine logic&quot; vs. &quot;feminine logic&quot; stuff here; Just logic: The book is a systematic expose of the problem, its toll on women, and its toll on the rest of the family -- men and children. The book is humane and compassionate in dealing with human suffering: It doesn't place men and women on opposite sides of some battle of the sexes, but rather places all of us on the same side -- the side of the victims -- of some really bad ideas that have been dominant in society for a long time.The book is frightening, because having read it, the magnitude and scope of women's suffering takes on a new meaning. The book is liberating, because having read it, you realise the mistakes you've made in your own life -- how you may have contributed to the problem, and you have a pretty good idea as to how to go about changing things -- your own life, and the way you deal with others.

                "review/text": "This is a well-documented and well-reseached book that discusses the problems faced by many American housewives. It was written in the sixties, when women were returning to their homes after the sexual revolution and the woman's right movement, when they were proudly filling in forms with &quot;Occupation: Housewife&quot; once again. These women were told by psychoanalysists, who mostly based their findings on Frued's theories, that a woman's sex life and happiness was ultimately found through living her life soley for her husband and children. The women Freidan studied and interviewed for this book were usually surburban wives, living in nice houses with their executive husbands who made a lot of money. These women had done everything right. They had married young: some barely finished or didn't finish high school, others dropped out of college, all for the goal of marrying their sweetheart and fulfilling the perfect image of the feminime mystique. These women had had many babies by natural childbirth, they sewed all their clothes and washed all their dished by hand, they had breastfed them all, they had doted on their childrens' and husband's interests and goals so much that they lost sight of their own. And even though these women were living by the perfect standards set by the &quot;feminine mystique&quot;, they were dreadfully unhappy. So many were seeing pscyhoanalysts without positive results, so many were harboring resentful, depressing thoughts, and contemplating everything from an extramarital affair to suicide. And the most common problem of all came to be known as &quot;chronic fatique syndrome&quot;. The women with this problem experienced listlessness and wrestlessness. They were always tired no matter how much they slept. Their joints and bones ached. They could not stayed interested in or concentrated on one subject for a long period of time. They were physically with their children all the time, but never really there in spirit.And so, based on these findings, Freidan studied these women more, interviewed them more, and wrote The Feminine Mystique, in which she published her theories. I found most of her ideas to be extremely well thought out, and I can imagine how much the american housewife of the sixties, and later, really needed these ideas. For instance, Friedan comments on how &quot;housework expands to fit the time available&quot;, noting that the house of the working women was always clean, even though she had a limited amount of time to clean it in, while the housewife who was perpetually cleaning and recleaning everything could never seem to &quot;get anything done&quot;. Friedan also studied the ways in which these mothers affected their children, and most grew up to be dependant and irresponsible. The men looked for girls to marry who would take the place of their mother, who did everything for them, and the girls grew up to be stuck in the same trap as their mother, being a mother not only to their children but to their husbands as well, since their husbands had grown up under the feminine mystique and expected his wife to act as his mother had. Many times, the mothers try to live the dreams they never got fulfilled because of early marriage and motherhood through their children, and this is never good.The most important thesis in this book, in my opinion, is the way in which Friedan pleads for women to become their own individuals. When a girl marries at seventeen, before she has even grown up herself, and has children of her own, her growing and learning process is stunted and she never finds out who she really is or what she really wants. When a woman waits on her family night and day, she loses such a big part of herself that she begins to feel like all she does for everyone else is useless and taken for granted. Freidan implores women to follow their own interests and not let the feminine mystique stunt their growth. She gives findings of women who finally went back to the desires and goals they had in their youth, as well as women who never left them but were the rare minority who combined motherhood with a career, and showed that they were no less women then the ones who stayed at home. In fact, having a life of their own improved the woman's marriage, family and sex life drastically when compared with the women whose worlds revolved around other people.I found a few problems with Friedan's book and although they are insignificant in comparison with the book's positive aspects, they are worth pointing out nonetheless. Mainly, although Friedan is very advanced for her time in suggesting freedom and independence for women, she was very descriminative against homosexuals. She spent the first half of her book refuting Freud's theories about women and stating how he was a bad pscyhologist with unexamined and biased theories when it came to this area. However, she backs up her thesis about &quot;weak&quot; homosexual men being drawn to the love of other men because of the relationship they still desire with their mothers with all of Freud's theories. I don't think she should tear Freud's theories apart when it is in her favor and use the same person to back her up when she is talking about a different subject. Also her book is still sexist in the sense that she always expects women to do the housework and, if they choose to have a career, manage it along with the housework, when what she should do is suggest that if the man and the woman are both working, the man and the woman should both help out with the housework. However, since her views were so revolutionary at this time I am sure she did not want to press it by suggesting men actually do &quot;woman's&quot; work, since her very suggestion that women can and should do &quot;man's&quot; work was already taking things far.On the whole this book was unquestionably fantastic. Although, fortunately, many women work today, some still face bias, prejudice, and descrimination from others, and this book goes to show that there is nothing wrong with a woman doing what she wants to do with her life just as there is nothing wrong with a man doing the same thing. And there are still some housewifes caught up in the feminine mystique who should read the book and find out why they are suffering the &quot;problem who has no name&quot;. I feel that this book has done a tremendous amount of good for women throughout history after its publication, and it can still do a lot for them today...",

The problem is that Friedan seems to think this problem only concerns housewives and stay at home moms, and that the problem could be solved by those women getting jobs outside the home. An interesting hypothesis, but judging by today's women, clearly wrong. There are plenty of career women that feel rather unfulfilled.She describes the problem as women slaving away to keep the house perfectly clean and the kids perfectly taken care of, and then getting depressed as a result. They do this out of a perceived societal pressure. To me, the solution seems to be to check whether this is really what their kids and husband want. In reality, probably no-one cares whether you wash the windows once per week or once per month, so you could spend that time thinking about your values in order to raise your kids as moral individuals, or learning about current events, so that you can actually have a real conversation with your husband, or reading a book for fun.Getting a job because you're feeling unfulfilled trying to outperform Martha Stewart is as much of an escape tactic as becoming an alcoholic. Being a teacher is as much \"living through others\" as being a mother is. Shuffling papers around like people with average office jobs doesn't intrinsically give any more fulfillment than making a healthy meal for your spouse and kids does.The book did some good in promoting equal rights for men and women, but also caused a harmful movement that indoctrinates modern girls and women that the *only* path to fulfillment is through employment, which is clearly nonsense. Housewives and mothers can be really valuable to society, which can give them a strong sense of fulfillment.Aside from the above, the research Friedan did to back up her point was rather bad and biased, with frequent misuse of statistics. A list of factual errors and omissions in her book is listed on this website:cf.en.clIn conclusion, the book is important as a historical document, but has to be approached with extreme caution.

Ms. Friedan tears apart the theories of Sigmund Freud to support her arguments on the role of women, but then uses them as \"evidence\" on how \"deviant\" homosexuality is. She says \"The role of the mother in homosexuality was pinpointed by Freud\", the same Freud she spends all of Chapter 5 tearing apart.

This is mainly summed up in the chapter: A New Life Plan for Women. I recommend this book simply on this chapter. It is inspiring, positive, and relevant for women to read, even to this day. However, the rest of this book was hard for me to get through. In reference to the title of my review, I am young and perhaps I can't relate to some of the issues Ms. Friedan has brought up because of the women's movement of the '60's and '70's which has provided me with more opportunity, as a woman, to make life and career choices for myself without pressure or guilt. I am glad that I don't have the restrictions that women had back then and I am so grateful that there were women out there that knew our potential and were not willing to compromise it. But asides from possibly not liking the material because I found it hard to relate to, I did find that Ms.Friedan used alot of subject matter that is at best, subjective (for instance, the chapter Mistaken Choice was absurdly biased-- she makes references that the men in the military that were rejected for service due to mental issues usually came from homes that had doting overly loving mothers, that juvenile deliquency was non-existent in the homes of mothers who worked, that Russian children were more stable and adjusted than American children because their mothers worked or had interests outside the home etc, and that she even goes to imply that over loving a child is more traumatic for the child than raising them in a household where whippings and beatings are frequent possibilties.) There are other scattered observations that she made that I found hard to swallow as well, such as part of the chapter The Sexual Sell which implies that business caters to the homemakers because they do all the buying, and that mothers with careers or serious interests outside the home do not have the time to take to buy from business. I find it hard to believe that big business couldn't capitalize on the working mom. I can't believe that a working mom wouldn't be interested in an appliance that could cut her time to get chores done back then as well as today. That part of the chapter made no sense to me. Basically, I felt that Ms. Friedan used a lot of subjective facts, scare tactics (mother and housewife bashing), and propaganda that was unnecessary, at best, to get to her more inspiring point. I felt that all that \"material\" detracted from the point of the book, but I am glad I made it all the way through to get to the \"New Plan.\" That's where the \"heart of the artichoke\" lies. But to those of you who feel that the point of the book is, \"women who are unhappy with their lives are this way because they don't have a job\" are missing the point. While although it is evident that she found her calling through her career and those around her (upper middle class women with privilege) did the same, her point is for women to challenge themselves and demand more than what is offered. Don't settle for less.",

As other reviewers have stated, her work could have easily been reduced to 3 or 4 chapters.In the first half of her book, she whines that women (as mothers) have been unfairly blamed for the various psychological woes of mankind, referencing, among others, Mr. Freud. Subsequently, however, she uses these same references to conclude that indeed mothers ARE to blame for the conditions of society--even going so far as to cite her nemesis Freud in a disturbing passage about the evils of homosexuality.While Friedan cites many studies (of her own, and of others) featuring America's downtrodden women, these studies feature exclusively MIDDLE and UPPER-CLASS women. As she is so diligently trying to prove that college-bound/educated women are being persuaded to accept the role of housewife in liu of a richer life, she completely overlooks the many women who do not have the option of going to college (or to a Freudian-biased psychologist, or to the suburbs...).Because of the importance of this work IN ITS TIME, I must give it 3 stars and not 2.

Ms. Friedan makes several good points, but then has the tendancy to draw them out pages and pages longer than they need go on (a group of my freinds who have also read this book agree with me that each chapter, minus quotes, could be reduced down to about a paragraph). She also has the tendancy to not say exactly the source of facts she has in her books. I often found myself reading something along the lines of &quot;...and a very famous study showed...&quot; without having a footnote, endnote, or any marks as to which study this so-called &quot;famous study&quot; is. Ms. Friedan is a very intelligent person, that much I do not deny, but she is not gifted with the ability to put things in their most succinct form. I wanted to give this book much less than 3 stars, but I couldn't, simply on the basis of what it is credited with doing. The book is very good in the way that it presents what were fairly radical ideas at the time it was published with a lot of vigor, but is one of those books where I found myself nodding off every paragraph or so and thinking after I got into a chapter &quot;Didn't I just read this a few lines ago?&quot; My bottom line is, if you want a book about femininity in the 60's and around that time period, read this book, but if you want a good book that deals just with real life struggles of a group of people, read W.E.B.

                "review/text": "Reading this self-congratulatory feminist manifesto, one gets the impression the author would have us believe women of the species have just parachuted into our midst rather than being our long-time companions down here on the planet of the (male) apes. Given their complicity in all the wonders &amp; woes through recorded time, it's only logical to attribute at least half-credit (and blame) for what humankind is and is becoming as due to their persisting and enduring influence over the eons. Yet here we find no such admissions of female culpability in the sorry state of the species. Instead, it seems to be exclusively males who have royally mucked things up so far. Yet, in the world according to Ms. Fisher, one must not despair, for all that will be changed as soon as women (the super sex) begin to come into their own. The reader is left with an uneasy impression this is all another thinly veiled sexist and virulently anti-male argument parading as social science a la Susan Faludi (\"Backlash\" and \"Stiffed\").In all this heady prose of feminist celebration one can almost hear the faint echoes of Helen Reddy's feminist paean \"I Am Woman' (Hear her roar!). Yet there is only anecdotal proof that any of what she purports is accurate or true of women in general, never mind that it will somehow ineluctably come to pass. For example, she boasts that women have \"natural\" talents males do not, and therefore are \"better suited\" biologically to excel at a whole range of complex social tasks than are males. This isn't a carefully couched scientific argument framed in terms of recognizing much wider individual variations within the female population itself than between males and females generally. Rather, it is argued as if it were a general sex-linked intellectual trait.Were I to argue the same thing about male math skills, natural aggression and violent tendencies, or leadership skills, I would be summarily shouted down and denounced as a reactionary sexist. Yet one finds no such recognition by the author that she is skating on the paper-thin ice of anecdotal supposition rather than on established scientific fact. Instead, she twists and turns her way through this hodge-podge of psychological, sociological, and biological data as though it were the dawning of the Age of Aquarius suddenly realized. A few sobering facts; males behave the way they do at least partially because of the way they are raised, and women are largely in control of this socialization process. Have we seen much in the way of sensitivity, wisdom, or \"win-win\" success displayed here? Hardly. If men are insensitive, unable to openly display their emotions, and distantly angry, women who raise them, sleep with them, and love them must share part of the blame.Judging by the performance of women in institutions where they are in the ascendency, such as at universities and medicine, emotionally-based political correct behavior has become the rule of the day. I was recently advised by a tenured female professor at a famous liberal arts college in western Massachusetts that the female caucus in her department was told to privately counsel any potential male PhD. candidates to refrain from wasting their time applying for teaching openings. Is this not blatant sex discrimination, deliberate prejudice of the first magnitude? Evidently not, my friend explained lamely that the ladies just want more time to 'season' the new female majority position within the department. And on and on.Furthermore, the evidence from the past indicates that omen throughout history like Cleopatra, Catherine the Great or Queen Elizabeth who have gained and wielded power have been quite as abusive in the use of that power as are men. This is not to suggest that women are any worst than men, or even the same as their male counterparts. But there is little proof that any of the giddy stuff she is supposing to be the wave of the future has any basis anywhere other than in her feminist fantasies. Thus, to suppose women are naturally superior healers, thinkers, communicators, and negotiators is just so much hot air escaping into the already supersaturated ozone layer.Men who have worked with women find them individually to be quite as arbitrary, capricious, selfish, and petty as the men they have labored under. Women who work for women are no more eager to celebrate their feminine superiors, but rather fear the personal consequences that the social, cultural, and politically-correct agendas many of their female supervisors harbor and use to separate the working wheat from the chaff. Like \"Backlash\" and \"Stiffed\", this is a silly, superficial, and self-interested gambit to further a feminist agenda by trying to foist the intrinsically sexist notion that there are such well-defined and momentously broad-based gender differences so critical to the way we humans interact socially, economically, and politically as to portend the dawning of some hopped-up revolutionary situation.

                "review/text": "It should be kept in mind that Helen Fisher is an anthropologist-not a neuroscientist. Moreover she is not part of the graduate faculty; rather she only holds a researcher's post at Rutgers. In academia she is widely regarded as something of a joke, presenting herself as an authority of a vast number of subjects. Many will have undoubtedly seen her making her appearances on many TV shows, such as 20/20 where her wonderful expertise on size-related issues on male genitalia and breast size can be found in such highly academic credited journals like Glamour and Cosmo. That alone speaks of the legitimacy of her \"expertise.\"Fisher is a woman with an ax to grind. She ludicrously present her rubbish nonsense as being concerned for \"equality,\" a lofty term often claimed by feminists like Fisher who clearly house a most tendentious thinking and desire to see a host of ridiculous role-reversals between the sexes.A reviewer has already commented on this, but it is worth reiterating. Fisher seems to be suffering or still dealing with women being sexually appraised by men. She talks about \"quality\" but then claims that women's economic status will trump man's and give women more sexual liberty. She predicts women will cheat just as much (if not more) than men and that women are no longer in need of man economically. Yet she concludes with monogamous relationship will be the rule. Somewhere the logical coherence unraveled.But then again, there was no real logical foundation. Fisher is starting with a desire to see the world though the fantasia of the 1970's feminists style thinking that she was exposed to when a student. She is sadly off the market on so many topics, concerning sex and cognitive gender differences.The truth is that there is no equality aside from equal opportunity. Men, as a whole, will always excel over women. Men are fundamentally wired to be more concerned for ideas and things than women. It is what drives them, and consequently what drives society forward. All of history is testament to this, in which men have ruled. Fisher proposes some far-fetched, ridiculous explanation of why this is the case, but asserts that now women are poised to take over that dominant role.But she has it wrong-yet again. She argues that women are more contextual, holistic, integrative thinkers. The skills that she claims women have would then be more \"right-brain.\" A few reviewers have made mention of this as well, but in fact men (as a whole) are more right-brained compared to women. It is in fact men that are the more contextual, central thinkers.A reviewer made mention of the May 2005 issue of Scientific American that contains an article on research that now shows men are indeed more right-brain dominant and more synergistic thinkers, in which disparate piece of information are integrated to formulate a contextual mental framework. Women in contrast are more individual discrete, detail orientated thinkers, in which the disparate pieces have more weight instead of the relational context between notions.But research a decade earlier had already shown this. Brain Sex : The Real Difference Between Men and Women by Moir and Jessel present research that illustrates what more recent research has refined in finter detail. The fact that men are more right-brain explains why men excel at spatial and mathematical thinking, are the more inventive sex, and why the male brain is the more naturally explorative, investigative, pioneering, conceptual intellect.It is exactly these right-brain skills that have ushered in the information age and what is truly in demand. And it is also why \"tomorrow,\" as Fisher puts it will still belong to men.In the book A Whole New Mind: Moving from the Information Age to the Conceptual Age by Daniel Pink, it is shown that right-brain intellects will be what is required and will be in demand in the work place. The same natural talents of men, which brought us the information age in the first place, will still be the same natural talents that will be in demand for not just today's work place-but tomorrow's as well. In short, tomorrow still belongs to men.The only real obstacle now facing men is the three decades insanity of feminist-based, biased, politically-correct policies. Parents need to be aware of the unfair educational practices that have disadvantage our sons in many ways and also have vilified malehood to the extent that even boyhood has been seen as \"problematic.\"Thomas Ellis addresses these gender political policies and issues in his wonderfully entertaining and long overdue polemic: The Rantings of a Single Male: Losing Patience with Feminism, Political Correctness... and Basically Everything. I highly recommend it.Highly recommended:A Whole New Mind: Moving from the Information Age to the Conceptual Ageby Daniel PinkBrain Sex : The Real Difference Between Men and Womenby Moir and JesselThe Rantings of a Single Male: Losing Patience with Feminism, Political Correctness... and Basically Everythingby Thomas Ellis",

                "review/text": "In reference to the reviewer below who states that men are more \"right-brained\" thinkers, it is interesting to note that modern science is now demonstrating this is true. The May, 2005 issue of Scientific American discusses how men have a more active right-amgydala compared to women, in which men tend to be more central or integrative thinkers. Women in contrast tend to be more left-amgydala dominant, which is more concerned with finer-detailed aspects of cognitive processes. Experiments using the drug Propranolol have shown this striking differences between the sexes. This fits well with experience, where in conversation women tend to focus much more on details that seem superfluous to men who want it put into a context. For men, the \"gist\" is what is most important. Thus, in direct contradiction to Fisher's claim, it is men that are more the contextual, holistic thinkers.Another interesting find is that women have a markedly higher orbitofrontal-to-amygdala ratio compared to men. The finding suggest that women on average might be able to then reign in their emotions better than men. This might very well be true, particularly when it comes to violent impulses. For other everyday encounters, however, it would seem judging at the rate of faux pas and other social effronteries committed by both sexes that neither gender seems particularly suited in reigning in less-than-desirable emotions. Given how some companies have had to actually have their human resource departments develop so-called \"bully broad\" programs, or anger-management for women managers, it would seem women do not have as an advantage the ability to control themselves emotionally. To be fair though, this might be more owed to the past trend of having looked the other way when a woman did something offensive because she was not a man, which normally would have gotten a man into trouble more readily.At the end of the day, however, when all is said and done, the differences between the sexes boils down to differences between individuals. I tend to think visually. I cannot recall telephone numbers readily numerically but tend to recall them in terms of their geometric arrangement on the touchpad. You can say the number to me but it sometimes just doesn't register until I see in down on paper and have it visually in my head. I can usually control my emotions but I am admittedly an over-emotional and passionate man when it comes to certain political or social stances and I am not at all shy in expressing myself forcibly when a wrong has been done. I can also be impatient when it comes to having to listen to the women in my life having to go through a laundry-list of details to get to the point, although I've grown more tolerant of this as I've gotten older and think it can be quite charming at times.In contrast, some of the women that have been personally involved in my life have run the gamut from proverbial \"tom-boys,\" who've been keenly interested in mechanical workings and very visual thinkers as well, to women who've proved an amalgam of just about every trite stereotype assigned to women. In short, we deal with people-individuals-not some nebulous average such as \"women\" or \"men\" said to then represent its individual members. This point and consideration was thoroughly lost by Fisher, who clearly proves she has a very strong agenda of seeing women ridiculously superior in virtually every realm over man.I don't fault all women for this error in thinking however; rather Fisher has proved that she is a very lef-amgydala dominant woman unable to see that holistic rich tapestry that is the human race in all its multivariate ways and capacities.",

                "review/text": "When I was a second year graduate student, I remember this book being recommend in the Editors Recommend section of Scientific American. I loaned out a copy and read the book over the weekend. Unlike some readers, I was not angered. Quite the opposite, I was genuinely amused and had confirmed what I already knew about women, namely that they are primarily left-hemispherical thinking people, mistaking their \"in the box\" cosmos for the universe at large. One only needs to look at the fields that place heavy demand on broad ratiocination and multivariate contingency thinking. Men dominate in those fields, such as engineering, computer science, and business to name a few. Women are comparatively rare. Even in physics and computer science, in which much has been spent in government funding to increase female enrollment, women do not pursue these fields. Often women get flustered in trying to focus their attention on tasks that have a multitude of components. Compared to men, women are not as apt to attenuate their mental efforts while simultaneously keeping a global perspective. A case in point is object oriented programming. A programmer must have a global understanding and vision of the task while concurrently being highly focused on the modular aspects of the program, seeing how each component synergistically fits together. If you've ever taken a programming course, you will undoubtedly have noticed that the female student body had a much harder time grasping these global and locally-integrative methods and struggled at programming tasks noticeably more than their male counterparts. The difference cannot be owed to a sexist dichotomy in teaching the sexes. It is clearly biological in origin. Another area where similar observation is made is in strategy games, which too place heavy burden on players to be highly focused yet have a very broad, highly contingency-based thinking, and a global breadth in both time and space. Such a game is chess, and men innately excel over women at this game by orders of magnitude. Even in the most rapidly expanding areas of scientific thinking where paradigm shifts are needed, in which seeing a new pattern or integrating synergistically facts with new understandings is required, men excel over women in this capacity. Genomics is one such field, in which men out number women tremendously in terms of contributions, even though biology as a whole is the most balanced field of science in terms of gender and in which contributions to this field can be literally made by anyone having access to the internet to access publicly accessibly databases. This is not to say there are no great female scientists or women who excel in math and science and have natural inclinations towards these area (I know because I am dating one). Comparatively, however, they are much more rare than men with such talents. As a whole, women see the world in a far more limiting fashion and often present their opinions as observations or, worse yet, as facts. They mistake their range of their thinking for the whole in a given area of consideration and seldom can think outside the proverbial box in a paradigmatic right-brained fashion. It's important to see the forest from the trees, but it is also important to recognize that the forest behaves qualitatively differently than the proverbially trees alone can account. Lastly, I find it interesting that some recent female authors such as Fisher and Natalie Angier (Woman: An Intimate Geography) are focused on the topic of \"female choice\" in mate selection. In this day of age where Britney Spears parades half naked on stage and neither sex is in want of opportunity for selection, I find these authors, who are to put it politely not the first choice a man would have in mind when seeking pulchritude, revealing their own internalized fantasia of having complete sexual choice to assuage the painful reality that their prospects are restrictive compared to many other women. True intelligence and beauty is a rarity by themselves. Together they are a most rare combination. After reading this book and seking the picture of Ms. Fisher, it does not surprise me that she is \"single\" and at least in her fifties now. It is safe to say then that the clear intellectual limitations of this author and her restrictive sexual prospects, coupled with her being in a male dominated field has created some bitterness expressed under the guise of \"equality.\" Hers is that classic role-reversal fantasy that many women from Fisher's era unfortunately suffer. The book is a genuine embarrassment for any claim of the innate superiority of women, given this poorly written and reasoned book was written by a woman.",

                "review/text": "...this book is rather horrendous in its relentlessly cheery women-are-so-much-better-than-men-at-what-really-matters attitude. I could barely make it through the first couple of dozen pages; it was that unbelievable. I'd even say it was so bad that she lost me in the first three pages with her statements about \"The Second Sex\". (If you don't buy what she says about that you may as well save your time and stop there.) And what's worse is that it's like this from wall to wall, as I discovered when I started jumping around, chapter to chapter, trying out the topics that most interested me, until I'd pretty much read the whole thing -- in utter amazement that anyone could think this way.As a scientist I'm prepared to listen to reasoned and complex arguments, but Fisher usually just states her conclusions about things as if she'd recently come down from the mountain with The Tablets of Truth and expects us to believe it all even though common sense and experience tells us that a lot of what she says is just plain nonsense. What \"evidence\" she presents is all one-sided (things are rarely that simple) and meant only to lead to a predictable point. There's no place in this book for any caveats, much less the reader who may ask \"but wait, what about _____?\" It's not on Fisher's radar screen. She doesn't seem to get it. (Just like a woman...) If you're looking for subtle, unexpected, and profound truths, you won't find any in this book.... \"The First Sex\" is nothing but a huge embarassment. It should be a scandal that such a book came out of a mainstream publisher from someone with a position (and a PhD) at what one would have thought was a reputable institution. I suppose it's a sign that academia isn't what it once was.I'll give it 1/2 - 1 star above the minimum because the chapters on dating/mating actually weren't terrible, not that they were all that great either.",

                "review/text": "Well, this was another one of those books I picked up to try to understand my mother-in-law better. Thank the gods that I found it used! This book is yet another one of those \"women are the nurturers\" sorts of books: just the sort of thing to give my MIL a present, after all, remember, \"women are tied to mother earth by virtue of their menstrual cycle!\" Remember that, and remember it well, for it will guide you in making sense (well maybe not SENSE, per se) of this unfortunate mishmash of sociobiology/genetics/post-feminist ramblings.You're probably wondering, in light of that last sentence, why I am giving this book three stars instead of the one that you would expect. One of the primary reasons is that, despite the sketchy facts, and the overall silliness, and the evidence that leads one to form the OPPOSITE conclusion to that the author seems to be promoting, this really is an amusing book, especially if you think that women and men are the way they are due to socialization.Opposite, eh? Well, by page 10, the author has asserted that only 50% of women express the genes that lead to the internetworked functions of both hemispheres in the cortex which results in the traits of \"web thinking,\" \"contextual thought,\" and nurturing that she associates with all women. Women, and only women, are capable of thinking in web-like and interconnected terms, according to the author, and her entire theory of women's pending ascendency in the world economoy is completely based upon these traits. However, there is one HUGE problem: the half of the female population that does NOT express these traits. So, will these spatially inclined, non-verbally fluent women who make up 50% of the female population be left behind in the coming business revolution? It is unclear, since the author never addresses any of these issues.I am one of those women who doesn't conform to the author's stereotype of women as the networkers; the emotionally literate person who can guess what a person is feeling and what he or she needs; who cares about family and group harmony above all else. In fact, frankly, I loathe emotional confrontation, family gatherings, and I could give a rat's patootie about harmony. I may be verbal and a \"web thinker\" but I am also rational, unemotional, unexpressive, and non-nurturing (that's not to say that I'm uncaring-- I'm very supportive-- but the other person has to tell me what he or she needs, despite Fisher's assertion that I should just be able to \"tell\" somehow, psychically).This founding fact upon which Fisher bases her entire analysis appears to indicate little that would contradict the theory that most gender differences are due to socialization rather than biology. Fisher's subsequent factoids and blurbs throughout the book do little to support her contention that men and women are designed differently in their capacities, or that they have evolved differently enough to justify them taking different roles in society. I thought that dreck had gone out with the feminine mystique, but it looks to be alive and well today, despite all fervent efforts to expunge it.At least Fisher managed to convey this all in an amusing way (well, to me, anyway. Maybe it was just the absurdity of it all...), which was something that the authors of \"The Female Power Within,\" a book about this same sort of dreck, didn't manage. So, if nothing else, that, at least, made this book somewhat worth reading.I never did mention what the third star was for. It's for Fisher providing me with a Christmas present for my mother-in-law, which she will love to death. Thank you, Ms. Fisher, for this small boon!",

                "review/text": "Psychobabble. For Ms Fisher's theories to have any validity, human brains would have to be hard wired like salamanders. ALL men thinking one way and ALL women thinking another. All human beings are individuals with individual talents and abilities.The idea that women have unique talents in verbal expression flies in the face of history. How would Helen Fisher explain Shakespear, Dostoyevsky, James Joyce, or thousands of other male communicaters? And where IS this evidence of superior female abilities at communication? They don't exist. If there are differences between the male and female brains, it is a difference in style and nuance, not the determanist gulf that she postulates. Every one of her points can be easily be refuted through common experience. Helen Fisher's book is radical feminist agit-prop in the guise of scientific analysis.",

I think it's fine to acknowledge the differences between men and women,in fact I'd like to see more discussion about this, especially the biological aspects. But why not show how both sexes have strengths and weaknesses, and how they compliment each other? Instead Fisher fills page after page claiming that women are superior at almost every task, and in most cases provides supporting arguments that are weak. Talents of males are mentioned as an afterthought. And of course in the 21st century the supposedly limited skill set of males will no longer be needed. I suppose many female readers will eat this up, but discrimination is discrimination, no matter where it's directed. The prose is quite choppy, kind of surprising, given the innately superior language abilities of women. She must have had a male editor.",

                "review/text": "The title basically says what this book is all about. That men are biologically inferior to women at least in the world to come. Now believe it or not, being an \"inferior male\" like I am, I actually approached this book with an open mind and thougt that if worse comes to worse, it would just humble me a bit more. However as I began to read the book all I saw was a chauvinistic attitude in regard to the research that was really out there. She talks about how the female mind is more creative then the male mind by saying things like how she first noticed this by examining her boyfriends behavior and then goes ahead and presents very biased evidence (of female superiority) without mentioning the loads of evidence that go against her conclusions. There are many books out there such as \"Autism and Creativity: Is There a Link Between Autism in Men and Exceptional Ability\" which give lots of proof that the extreme male brain often found in autism that many creative geniuses such as the physicist Newton and the poet Yeat's had may surprisingly actually be of great \"great creative worth,\" and not just of secondary status as this author seems to imply. She goes onto say almost undoubtedly that women's \"superior creativity\" is going to change society. Then why haven't things like this happened yet. For instance Jews have been denied rights almost since the beginning. It was only in the late 1800's to early 1900's that they started to get equal rights under the law in america. Since then almost immediately they began making a huge impact on societal culture. They have been found in the top ranks in the arts and science at a ratio to their actual population size of about 8:1. Also while they make up about 2% of the american population they have won about 27% of nobel prizes awarded to american scientists. Why haven't the same number of these great achievements come even close to these with women (if the author claims they are so superior to men) since they have gotten equal rights and opportunities at about the same time in america as groups such as the jews? Of course, the author doesn't mention things like this and just blames things that may not be to flattering with women on \"male oppression\" and anything that may make them sound good as part of their \"inherent advantage\". This subject is, of course very complex and I don't have time to go into it more here. However, neither does the author of \"The First Sex\" come even close to doing the subject justice in her entire book either, especially for men.",
