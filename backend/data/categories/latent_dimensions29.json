        "description": "\"An intense, sometimes graphic, totally heartbreaking portrait of a character who will keep pages turning.\" - Booklist, Starred Review \"An achingly fierce exploration of the way the world wounds us and heals us. If you love exquisitely written coming-of-age stories that will leave you breathless, In Sight of Stars is for you.\" - Jeff Zentner, William C. Morris award-winning author of The Serpent King and Goodbye Days Seventeen-year-old Klee's father was the center of his life. He introduced Klee to the great museums of New York City and the important artists on their walls, he told him stories made of myths and magic. Until his death. Now, forced to live in the suburbs with his mom, Klee can't help but feel he's lost all the identifying parts of himself-his beloved father, weekly trips to the MoMA, and the thrumming energy of New York City. That is until he meets wild and free Sarah in art class, with her quick smiles and jokes about his \"brooding.\" Suddenly it seems as if she's the only thing that makes him happy. But when an act of betrayal sends him reeling, Klee lands in what is bitingly referred to as the \"Ape Can,\" a psychiatric hospital for teens in Northhollow. While there, he undergoes intensive therapy and goes back over the pieces of his life to find out what was real, what wasn't, and whether he can stand on his own feet again. Told in alternating timelines, leading up to the event that gets him committed and working towards getting back out, Gae Polisner's In Sight of Stars is a gorgeous novel told in minimalist strokes to maximal effect, about what makes us fall apart and how we can put ourselves back together again.",

Belva Plain isn't the first author to use modern terms for old-fashioned expressions. Other authors have fallen into the same trap. Blame the editors for not catching this type of mistake. As for Leo taking credit for rescuing the abandoned dogs, this is what people with low self-esteem sometimes do to make themselves feel important.I've always enjoyed Belva Plain's books. She writes beautifully about everyday people caught in everyday conflicts. The passage of time in her books is written seamlessly, and sex is left to the reader's imagination. If you can't imagine it, then you know what you have to do.",

                "review/text": "What can any reader say about an author who hit big with her first book Evergreen during the 1970's. The story of a young immigrant who goes to work at the home of a wealthy family and becomes involved with the dashing son, also gave birth to several other books in a series focusing on these two eventual families. Evergreen was also made into a television movie with Armand Assante and Lesley Anne Warren which I still enjoy watching. To say that I loved and continue to love the book , Evergreen, is an understatement and so with each book that Belva Plain wrote I was first on line to buy a copy. But in the succeeding years her books which took place during present day and grappled with many of the ills of our society like infidelity, embezzlement and betrayal, failed to move or interest me and most likely the last book I will read by this author.The story of a man that goes from rags to riches in a retail operation beginning in the early 1900's, marries the girl of his dreams and has many children and grandchildren has certainly been told before and in my opinion better in books like As the Crow Flies by Jeffery Archer and A Woman of Substance. Plain fails to deliver memorable characters or anything else of much value in this book I'm afraid to say. Despite a rather odd brother and historical events like WWI and the Depression plus a dark secret about the main character's failed to interest me more than a ho hum and ultimately led me to rate this book as low as I did. In addition I wondered why errors like words which were never used in this time period weren't caught during editing .It was almost as if this book took place now and the author simply used the early years to create a sense of a generational novel.Perhaps once cherished author lie Belva Plain should know \"when to hold them and certainly when to fold them. I keep hoping Belva Plain' newest books will be as good as her first one. Regrettably this may be the last time I will read one of Belva Plain's new books preferring to revisit Anna and Paul Werner in Evergreen instead.",

                "review/text": "I read all the reviews and was astounded that no one seemed to see what Belva Plain was doing with this little book at all. I haven't read \"Evergreen\" but it hardly seems fair to knock Sight of the Stars for not being another book that you loved. I was about 3/4 of the way through the book on a plane flight from Paris to the US when I realized what the author's theme was and how skillfully she had woven her revelation of it through the lives of the Amring family members. Readers who were dissapointed with the \"boring\" plot and lack of a deep dark secret in brother Leo's life entirely missed the point. Or rather I should say, they demonstrate the point; which is, that it is all too easy for us poor humans to misjudge one another and miss the truth of the lives of the people we interact with. Adam makes a preliminary mistake in his assessment of every important character he deals with. His life teaches him how he was wrong and he grows wiser and more humble until in the end, just before he dies, he is willing to admit that perhaps he was wrong about Leo too. Perhaps he should forgive his brother and find him. Adam discovers this too late for a reconcilliation but the reader is allowed to see the \"truth\" about Leo. It is brillantly done, for the reader is brought to realize that perhaps they too had been wrong about Leo, imagining all sorts of dark perverted things about him when in fact his books were simply his refuge and the way he taught himself foreign languages etc. Those who were dissapointed that there was not some horridly wicked revelation about Leo in the end REALLY missed the point. The book is not meant to be one of those sagas that leaves you feeling as if you were forever entertwined with characters in them who had been brillantly brought to life. Rather, reading it is like solving an intellectual puzzle of masks and characters and motives revealed so that the reader turns from that puzzle instructed and more humble about the characters that inhabit his own real life and asks himself, \"Do I know these people as they truly are?\" In the end the puzzle for me became more than just intellectual and became profoundly moving, even spiritual. I loved this book for the way it stretched my mind and heart.",

This story was wonderful, I especially enjoyed the character of Adam. Belva can write a family saga like nobody's business. I hear that three of her other novels: \"Evergreen\", \"The Golden Cup,\" and \"Tapestry\" are a series of books covering one families story. I have already ordered them and look forward to the cold winter nights ahead sitting in front of my fireplace reading another one of her \"dishy\" family sagas (only if it snowed in Los Angeles). How wonderful it would be to be snowed in with a fire in the hearth, lots of hot chocolate, and a stack of Belva's stories. I give this story a 4 star rating as I felt the story was a little rushed at the end. Highly recommended however.Guy V. De RosaLos Angeles",

        "description": "Michael Goldhaber, writing in Wired, said, \"If there is nothing very special about your work, no matter how hard you apply yourself you won't get noticed and that increasingly means you won't get paid much either. In times past you could be obscure yet secure -- now that's much harder.\" Again: the white collar job as now configured is doomed. Soon. (\"Downsizing\" in the nineties will look like small change.) So what's the trick? There's only one: distinction. Or as we call it, turning yourself into a brand . . . Brand You. A brand is nothing more than a sign of distinction. Right? Nike. Starbucks. Martha Stewart. The point (again): that's not the way we've thought about white collar workers--ourselves--over the past century. The \"bureaucrat\" on the finance staff is de facto faceless, plugging away, passing papers. But now, in our view, she is born again, transformed from bureaucrat to the new star. She works in a professional service firm and works on projects that she'll be able to brag about years from now. I call her/him the New American Professional, CEO of Me Inc. (even if Me Inc. is currently on someone's payroll) and, of course, of Brand You. Step #1 in the model was the organization . . .a department turned into PSF 1.0. Step #2 is the individual . . .reborn as Brand You. In 50 essential points, Tom Peters shows how to be committed to your craft, choose the right projects, how to improve networking, why you need to think fun is cool, and why it's important to piss some people off. He will enable you to turn yourself into an important and distinctive commodity. In short, he will show you how to turn yourself into . . . Brand You.

The author graciously sent back a long, detailed reply which contained a nugget that I remember to this day. The author said, &quot;You should be more judicious in your use of exclaimation points. A writer only gets to use three of them in his career.&quot; Meaning, of course, that if you overemphasize every other sentence, how to you get the reader to understand the importance of something that really needs the emphasis? If you have to use italics and caps and exclamation points to get your point across, you're choosing the wrong words.Which brings us to Mr. Peters. If you're looking for some interesting and useful advice on how to market yourself and your career, this book is quite good. Peters does drive me up the wall a bit with his relentlessly energetic and optimistic tone, but he does give good advice. I don't think Tom takes into account how resistant some workplaces are to people who behave like he tells us to, and his irritating call to make everything you work on a &quot;WOW&quot; project makes me wonder if he knows what it's like to man the front-line trenches of corporate America. But again, what he writes is worth reading.What I find fault with is the how Peters says it. He can't write a sentence without words in ALL CAPITALS and italics (which, alas, I can't show you in an Amazon review). And, of course, Peters loves exclamation points!!!! In fact the logo of his company is an exclamation point!!! He uses enough exclamation points that there is NO WAY to tell what is just ROUTINE INFORMATION and what is VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. See how INCREDIBLY IRRITATION this is??!!! Read &quot;The Brand You 50&quot; and you find all sorts of good info, but you'll have to hack through an ENTIRE BOOK that is written LIKE THIS!!!!!!!",

It was easy to pick up and read tidbits over and over agian. I found the 'Todo' ideas at the end of every chapter (&amp; I use this term loosely) to be the most valuable part of the book.The mechanics where a little disoriented, and the presentation was real and meaningful, if not a little raw at times.

Each to do is a groaning soul searching question that drags you down and lifts you up with a euphoric (and addictive)self-realization.I decided to buy Tom's book after reading about a fifth of it in the book store.

So it doesn't flow as well it could. Also, if he really wanted people to take action as quickly as he says he does it would have helped to have some room to write right there in the book.

This trend is already well advanced with software writers and other scarce professionals. Tom Peters has moved well beyond what has already happened to create a useful portrait of how to play this new role in order to have the most satisfaction and success. Further, he asserts that those in the non-scarce areas like human resources, purchasing, and so forth had better do the same thing . . . because 90% of these jobs will be gone in 10 years. I sometimes think that Tom Peters overstates things, but in this one area I think he is understating what needs to be done. Whether you are an employee, want to start your own firm, have friends and children who want good careers, or have just lost your job, this is an extremely important book on how to take charge of your own career (and to help those you care about do the same) to create the most benefit for those you serve (your clients, in Peters parlance)and yourself. Although you will recognize all of the ideas from having seen them elsewhere before, you will find the way he has woven them together to be practical, mutually-supportive and thought-provoking. I know that I got several good ideas from this book. As a business book author who helps people get a lot more with less ... and in less time, I found an additional benefit. This book is a great profile of how to be Tom Peters, the world's most successful business guru. I found this to be his most self-revealing book, and although I have always liked his work, I found that liked him personally a lot better as a result of what he shows about himself. If you are a Tom Peters fan, be sure to add this book to your reading list! You'll be glad you did. You'll live a much more interesting, meaningful, productive life as a result. This book is part of his 3 book series: Reinventing Work. I also recommend his book, Professional Service Firm 50, and you can read my comments about that book on that book's page on Amazon.com.",

I was really interested in hearing about brand and the new economy the author envisioned, but the book is just too distracting to read. I \"read\" about 1/2 of it, and I'm not sure if there were more than three full sentences that I had found up until that point. Text changes color, size, boldness throughout. Liberal and nonsensical use of punctuation is infuriating after the first page.The book reads like a spoken seminar, and squanders the opportunity of actually being a book, which could have afforded a more in-depth look at the authors ideas.I would highly discourage anyone serious about this topic from buying this book. It is more of a super-happy high school cheerleader dialog than any type of meaningful discussion.",

                "review/text": "Yes, much of what negative reviewers of this book have to say is true: the writing is blunt and simple, the characters lack depth and complexity, it is quite male-focused in its subject matter and language, it has a bunch of quasi-religious mumbo-jumbo, and so on. This book should not be put on the list of great literature for the ages. There are doubtless many novels that cover subject matter from this book far more artfully. As I read the book, I was aware of its hokeyness and lack of redeeming literary qualities. I am, in fact, usually the first person to criticize books that read like this.And yet, I have to say - and I feel a bit sheepish about this - that I found it meaningful, even profound at times. How can I say this, given my criticisms? First of all, unlike many reviewers, I did not approach this book with great expectations. No one told me that this was Shakespeare or Tolstoy; I had never even heard of it until it was recommended to me recently. And by the end of page 2, I had adjusted my expectations further. This clearly was not going to be winning the Booker prize.But I found the book moving in its simple way. The characters deliver their statements without subtlety, but subtlety is more a literary virtue than a philosophical one. In fact, I essentially came to view this work as a life philosophy expressed as a fable, so I didn't particularly mind that its messages were not buried far beneath the surface.Are those messages novel? No, but what of it? Novelists have been recycling themes for centuries, becuase many themes are of enduring interest and relevance. The point is, the messages are worthwhile and deserving of consideration. They are simple, but I think that simplicity is itself one of the central themes of the book: that life is not that complicated when one follows one's dreams honestly and passionately, or as the book says, \"with love and purpose.\" And yet the book reminds us that it is very easy to give up dreams and abandon one's passion.I have to disagree with one often-mentioned criticism of the book, namely, that it advocates pure materialism. That is, in my opinion, a serious misinterpretation. The book is written in the style of a fable, and therefore the goals people strive for are the typical gold-and-buried-treasure stuff. But I think one would have to misread the book quite severely to think that it is advocating material gain. The book is not at all about the specific goals that the protagonist pursues. It is about the importance of wanting something urgently and how the wanting seems to reorient the universe in harmony with that goal (just as a magnetic field can reorder the particles around it), how genuine passion and enthusiasm are rewarded with success, how those who love us encourage us to pursue our goals, and how the act of reaching for goals - whatever they are, and whether or not ultimately reached - plunges us into a strong current that carries us to places that we can never expect or know when we embark. There is something here in common with the beliefs of the Romantics, in that much of the value of the goal is in the journey that it leads us on -- the experiences gained and the lessons learned.It's not a fair criticism of the book, I think, to say that it doesn't tell us what happens when people's goals conflict with one another, or disclose that circumstances outside of our control often render us unable to reach our goals however sincerely we may pursue them. We don't need a book to tell us that. Anyone who has made it out of childhood knows that, and I have to believe that the author is well aware of this as well. I suspect that through his simple tale, he is trying to provide some kind of argument against the kind of cynicism or fear that the world can sometimes instill in us, and encourage us to keep diving into that &quot;strong current&quot; to see where it takes us.",

It's entertaining and brings a message which does not need to be complicated, except for those who are not ready to see the truth. They are the ones who like their truth heavily veiled and masked, as their self-gratification is in the pursuit. The reality is, the only place you need to look for the truth is in yourself. There is no search required- just your own personal journey.Life does not need to be complicated, and the folks who have made negative comments about those who enjoy this book have obviously missed the point of it entirely- and they bring to mind the phrase \"Casting Pearls before Swine.\"You are not going to get anything valuable from this book unless you are READY for the spiritual knowledge which it contains. And that is one of the main points of the book anyway.Personally, I received deep spiritual messages and peace from reading The Alchemist- and I have been on my own spiritual path for over two decades. This book presents information that only those who have actually paid attention to their journey would understand and appreciate.If you read it and don't like it, I suggest you forget about it for at least 5 years and pick it up again. You might be surprised.Update, 10/2003:Oh. My. Gosh. I can't believe how many people just \"don't get\" this book!!! Look: the point is not about anyone's \"Personal Legend\"!!!THE POINT, is that what you search for is usually RIGHT THERE all along, and that the journey you take to find it is about learning lessons and growing as a person. Get it yet? LIFE IS IN THE JOURNEY, NOT THE DESTINATION!!Santiago set off to find his \"pot of gold,\" and after a long journey during which he grew mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, he finally discovers the location of the treasure. He follows the directions and find it RIGHT WHERE HE STARTED!GET IT?!!!You have what you need inside of you all of the time. You don't need to search outside yourself- you need to look within.

                "review/text": "More parable than novel, \"The Alchemist\" uses the story of young shepherd Santiago's search for his Personal Legend as an allegory for everyman's struggle to break from the comfortable confines of conformity and pursue his life dreams. Along the way, of course, our young everyman is beset by all manner of setbacks, testing his resolve and forcing him to become attuned to the Soul of the World in order to survive. By paying attention to the details in the world around him, which serve as omens guiding him towards his goal, young Santiago becomes an alchemist in his own right, spinning unfavorable circumstances into riches.Aside from the ubiquitous theme about the power of perseverance, my favorite part of the book was its glorification of simplicity. Like the pared-down manner in which the story is presented, Santiago's rare ability to get in touch with the Soul of the World comes not from the procedures described in arcane tomes pursued by traditional alchemists, but rather from a simple honesty and observance of the workings of the world. While the lack of character or plot complexity precludes this minimalist work from being considered a great novel, it will be a satisfying read for those seeking inspiration of the purest sort.-Kevin Joseph, author of \"The Champion Maker\"",

I may have loved Catch 22, but I won't necessarily remember it forever, where as The Alchemist raised many issues I believe I will ponder for the remainder of my life. It is a fairly swift read, read by me at odd moments during a single day and finished at the close of the night, and could be described more as pyshcology before novel, however the philosophies of the book are presented brilliantly. Behind the magical mysterious story of a travel loving shepard seeking his true destiny and meeting many people who will shape the rest of his life along the way. I could never 'love' this novel, but it is most certainly an important one, that I will not forget, and although I do not agree with all issues raised, it certainly prompted a fury of thought regarding my life path, and whether I will be doing what I want to in six years, and in sixty. This is single objective of Cohelo's simple book. Hence, for me this book was an utter success. I felt that the length of the book was sufficent; any longer it may have seemed like preaching.

I understand that it's a simple fable and I'll even grant the &quot;follow your heart&quot; message may be a virtuous pursuit. But the manner in which this message is delivered is tortuous. The characters are passive and hollow and the plot is so contrived as to render the story ridiculous. Instead of having to resolve significant conflicts himself, Santiago floats through the story guided by a sequence of serendipitously fortuitous events. Coelho attributes this to the &quot;universe conspiring&quot; to help him attain his Personal Legend. I attribute this to weak writing.The underlying message of this book is also troubling. Rather than finding happiness in the journey itself, it suggests that salvation lies in attaining one's Personal Legend--in this case material wealth. The implicit flip-side of this lesson is that if you don't reach your goals, you're either not trying hard enough or not following your &quot;true calling&quot; -- when in reality one's failure is more often attributed to a bunch of external factors over which one has no control.Those who find this book inspirational probably also find wisdom in fortune cookies and horoscopes.",

When I read the reviews online, one guy mentioned he thought &quot;The Alchemist&quot; was superior to the story of &quot;Illusions.&quot; I finally got around to &quot;Alchemist&quot; and I must say I was quite disappointed.First off, yes I realize it's considered a fable, but the writing style is far too simplistic. I don't know if it's the translation, but it reads like a book an elementary schooler would read for a report. Annoying points: there are page after page of adolescent terms like &quot;Master Work&quot; and &quot;Personal Legend&quot; and &quot;Language of the Universe&quot;, repetitious redundancies of quotes, just in case you haven't been paying attention, and very little masking of points. Coelho must not trust the reader to pick things up because he screams them at you.But, that's just the writing style. As for the writing, there is a clear spiritual basis to the story, which is welcome, but the incessant talk of fate was a complete turn-off. I also felt there was an air of superiority to it. Santiago would pass people who seemed happy in their lives, and he would feel sorry for them because they weren't on a trek. In the case of the crystal shop owner, yes, he was pathetic for not pursuing his dream of going to Mecca. But to look at another shop owner and judge he has not pursued his dream, when perhaps his dream was to settle with his family, was distracting.On to love....um, he meets a woman midway through the story and falls in love before they speak? Oooookay. And this woman he supposedly loves, and with whom he could settle with and be rich, he leaves to discover a treasure. Why is his dream that of a material/monetary nature? I had a tiny problemo with that one.So, before this becomes a lecture. I give it 3 stars for some of the dialogue Santiago has with the alchemist, and for its basic idea: pursue your dream, as it will haunt you if you don't. However, this is hardly a fantastic book....it just speaks to the masses, where others may require one to think more.",

Yes, that's right--despite the fact that I have a wife and two children who leave me with nary a free moment even on my holidays, I managed to put this book away in exactly twenty-four hours.There are some books one ploughs through breathlessly, excitedly, because one can not put them down until one runs out of pages to read. There are others that one disposes of quickly because there is nothing resembling content to hold one up. The Alchemist falls into the latter category.Some may claim that people are missing the \"hidden story\" in this book. As Paulo Coelho continually beats readers over the head with the simplistic feel-good \"hidden story,\" I would have to argue that most people with a basic grasp of literacy will catch on.I recommend that you leave this one to Julia Roberts on the beach.",

But I found that the lessons contained in this simple story of a shepherd boy seeking treasure, won't be dismissed so easily. They must have taken up residence in my subconscious and kicked up some dust, because my mind keeps returning to the lessons of the story to find new and more subtle insights having formed.These are lessons that we all know in our hearts, but that we forget as we get wrapped up in the hustle and bustle of our material lives. Lessons about listening to our hearts and following our dreams. Lessons about living in the moment, the transient nature of possessions and the illusion that we can even &quot;possess&quot; something to begin with. Lessons about freeing ourselves from fear and about understanding our lives as part of the energy of the Universe and understanding that everything will work out the way it was intended to. Lessons about trusting in signs, knowing that our lives have a grand purpose and that the forces of the Universe will conspire to help us fulfill that purpose. And the lesson that all of the fortunes and misfortunes we encounter in life are part of our spiritual education, and that it's not the earthly &quot;treasure&quot; we seek that's important but the lessons learned while in pursuit of it.If you like to ponder the meaning of life, then let your mind and spirit mull over the lessons in this book.

        "description": "Five years in the writing by one of science fiction's most honored authors, Doomsday Book is a storytelling triumph. Connie Willis draws upon her understanding of the universalities of human nature to explore the ageless issues of evil, suffering and the indomitable will of the human spirit. For Kivrin, preparing an on-site study of one of the deadliest eras in humanity's history was as simple as receiving inoculations against the diseases of the fourteenth century and inventing an alibi for a woman traveling alone. For her instructors in the twenty-first century, it meant painstaking calculations and careful monitoring of the rendezvous location where Kivrin would be received. But a crisis strangely linking past and future strands Kivrin in a bygone age as her fellows try desperately to rescue her. In a time of superstition and fear, Kivrin-barely of age herself-finds she has become an unlikely angel of hope during one of history's darkest hours. Praise for Doomsday Book \"A stunning novel that encompasses both suffering and hope. . . . The best work yet from one of science fiction's best writers.\"-The Denver Post \"Splendid work-brutal, gripping and genuinely harrowing, the product of diligent research, fine writing and well-honed instincts, that should appeal far beyond the normal science-fiction constituency.\"-Kirkus Reviews (starred review) \"The world of 1348 burns in the mind's eye, and every character alive that year is a fully recognized being. . . .

                "review/text": "I wanted to like Doomsday Book. I respected the five years of work that went into it, the Hugo and Nebula awards it earned, and the recommendation by friends. I expected something rich and detailed, something that would draw me in and not want to let go. What I got was a &quot;whole lotta nothing.&quot; Had this book been a third of its near 600-page length it might have been a tight, moving story. As it is, the characters have seemingly eons of time to wander through, both forwards and backwards.The book contains two stories running in parallel. In the 'modern' one (actually several decades from now) Kivrin, a young Oxford historian, is sent back in time to 1320 despite great misgivings by her professor, James Dunworthy. Dunworthy spends the next several weeks trying to make sure she's all right and can return home, a formidable task due to an epidemic that has broken out at the college and a hopelessly ignorant department head who organized the 'drop.' The second story deals with Kivrin's experiences in the past, and her own battles against ignorance and illness. The ever-present questions are, &quot;will Kivrin get home?&quot; &quot;will she die in the past?&quot; &quot;will everyone die in the future?&quot; and &quot;can any of this be stopped?&quot;When I say &quot;ever-present&quot; that's exactly (unfortunately) what I mean. 200 pages into Doomsday Book I thought that I'd never read so much of so little. 400 pages in, when then modern folks learn an important (and obvious since about page 20) fact about Kivrin's trip back in time, I thought that at last we could move forward. And we did, a little, but not much, and not enough.So what fills 600 pages? The same questions, over and over again. The same characters, exhibiting the same behavior that they did in their first appearance. The same technical information, repeated constantly. And a minimal story, about two separate epidemics. Even these are reported more as casualty lists than personal reactions to illness and death. Ms. Willis gives us little opportunity to truly inhabit either world, holding us at a distance with endlessly repeated facts. The large group of characters never seem more than one-dimensional props, conveniently there to manipulate the story when needed. The biggest question mark is Dunworthy and his obsession with Kivrin. His colleagues and friends are dying around him and he thinks only of a student, not even his personal student. Why? He doesn't develop this feeling over the course of time; he's plopped in that way and stays so until the end. Nothing changes, the other deaths barely touch him; it's Kivrin start to finish. And we're never told why. I thought at least that we'd be treated to some kind of love story, but no. It just is what it is, another fact we're to accept.What is perhaps most aggravating about Doomsday Book is that some of the facts it loves are manipulated so as to make little or no sense. For instance, a large part of the book deals with the difficulty of getting someone on the phone, leaving a message, or even finding a phone to use. Dunworthy resorts to having characters wait in his room to take messages for him while he's out. This would seem absurd even today, and I would imagine that in an age where time travel is possible people would not have discontinued the use of cell phones, voice mail, or even answering machines. The Medieval world has incongruities as well, as when Willis describes a landscape after a fresh snowfall, where roads show up as black lines. How is this possible? A) it just snowed. B) Everyone is dead, so no one has traveled lately. C) presumably the plow hasn't just gone through. These roads would be covered in white snow, just like everything else. It's obvious to us, but it's crucial to the story that they be black, so they're black.The late film critic Gene Siskel had a wonderful question when reviewing a movie; &quot;Is this film more interesting than a documentary of the same actors having lunch?&quot; I'd apply that here in this form; &quot;Is this book more interesting than the author's research materials?&quot; I'd have to say no; I did learn things about Medieval life, but found myself wanting to read the original sources in order to complete the sketchy picture. Kivrin arrives in the past in a haze of illness, but the fog never seems to clear, and we see little of how this life actually affects her beyond a historical-document feeling. The most ridiculous element is perhaps that she's supposed to be viewed as a saint sent by God to help the locals through this time. This is not shown to us by anything the characters do or say; it's simply stated to us. Without backing it up with actions or reactions it means nothing. It's just another fact, weak and debatable.",

While well researched, the book doesn't flesh out the details enough to qualify in that category either. I guess this book is really just about people and how they react in a crisis.

                "review/text": "Winner of both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for science fiction, this book is a tour de force that is sure to captivate all those who love time travel themes, as well as those who have a deep appreciation for medieval history. The author masterfully melds these two genres, creating a novel that is riveting and highly entertaining.The year is 2048 A.D., and a young history student named Kivrin is preparing to do an on site study of the turbulent fourteenth century. Her mission has placed two of the University's professors at cross purposes, as the proponent for this study, Mr. Gilchrist, finds himself pitted against Mr. Dunworthy, Kivrin's mentor, who believes that this trip in time is far too dangerous. Mr. Gilchrist, however, is in the position to have the final say on the project.Kivrin is scheduled to land in the rural English countryside of the fourteenth century some twenty years before the Black Death savages England. Armed with the knowledge of fourteenth century customs, dress, languages, religious practices, and history, Kivrin is raring to go back in time. When she travels back, however, an unforeseen crisis in the present places Kivrin in a potentially deadly situation upon her arrival in the past.The book alternates between what is happening in the present and what is happening in the past, as those in the present work to unravel the mystery of what went wrong. Meanwhile, Kivrin struggles to overcome the anomalous situations she encounters that run contra to her expectations. Believing herself stranded in the past, Kivrin artfully maneuvers around the precarious situations in which she finds herself, never losing her humanity despite the horror of her situation, given what went wrong.Steeped in well-researched medieval life, it is the story of Kivrin's sojourn in the past that captures the imagination of the reader. This is a stunning book that is totally gripping. The spellbound reader will definitely keep turning the pages of this wonderful book, which is clearly written by a master storyteller. Bravo!",

                "review/text": "I really did not enjoy this book. The story itself is passably interesting and could have resulted in a much better result. I think the two things that bothered me the most were the characters and the annoying plot mechanisms used by the author to try to build suspense and tension. With regard to the characters, most of them were either weeping and wailing over their self-created predicaments and misunderstandings, or allowing someone else to walk all over them when it would have been just as easy to speak one word and put a stop to it. While characters of this ilk have a place, this book has nothing but. By far the most annoying thing in this book were the contrived 'crises' that were seemingly designed to increase tension and/or increase the page total. The book is rife with examples of one or another of the aforementioned characters bemoaning the fact that they absolutely MUST speak to another character in order to straighten out some grave misunderstanding or find out some vital piece of information. They try and try, but something always prevents them. They finally (chapters later)get a perfect opportunity and GET DISTRACTED AND MISS IT (and then moan about their loss)! This happens again and again and again (at the hospital, trying to find her entry point, etc). It is as if the author is so enamored with this plot device that she can think of no other. It gets very tiring and frustrating and in at least one instance led me to throw the book across the room. Another annoying plot contrivance is that we have to wade through page after page of the heroine trying to figure out some trivial event when the answer has been made painfully clear. It just makes her look stupid. An example: The little girl is repeatedly(for over two pages) bugging our heroine because she wants to visit her dog's grave at the church. Our heroine keeps saying 'No'. Moments later, the little girl disappears. We have to slog through TEN PAGES of the heroine's frantic searching of the attic, the basement, the stables, etc. before she thinks to look for her at the church! Nothing comes of it, it was apparently just put in to pad the page count. Perhaps this is supposed to induce tension, but after countless episodes of this stupidity it is just annoying. I have lost much respect for the Nebula and Hugo awards because of this book.",

The concept of &quot;character development&quot; completely escapes the author, hence my lack of caring about who died, who is in trouble, etc. Why care? Another problem is the pace of the book. It is, to my knowledge, the slowest book you will ever read. Painfully, remove-your-own-teeth-with-a-screwdriver painful. I tried to bravely make it at least half way, but alas, my mind shut down at one-third. Wretched. This book inexplicably won a prestigious award for science fiction.",

In short, no matter how you slice it--and there is a lot of very, very repetitive verbiage to slice--, it is worth little. I can only think those praising it have not read many books, at least not many good books.(If the idea of someone venturing from modern times into the middle ages and eventually finding himself, against his initial prejudice, sympathetic with its inhabitants appeals to you, then read Mark Twain's &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;. Novels treating the era more realistically include Umberto Eco's &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; and Hermann Hesse's &quot;Narcissus and Goldmund&quot;.

I agree with all of this; had I not been on an 11-hour flight I would have given up on this book after 200 dragged-out pages.Willis' setting of modern Oxford was laughable. (One five-star reviewer raves about her marvelous setting of Cambridge, so I'm not sure he even read the same book I did.) Her geography of the area around Brasenose College is sketchy and incorrect, and I had no sense whatsoever of this city where so much of the book takes place. I cannot believe she visited even once. And although she spen an lot of time on the research, she only thanks one librarian in the acknowledgements, which seems awfully suspicious for a 600 page novel steeped in history. (Look at the acknowledgements page of any historical non-fiction book and you'll see what I mean.)Just as I dislike Convenient Weather (i.e. the plot is stormy and therefore it is lashing with rain), I despise Convenient Deaths. The clerk drags out for days and days in an ugly manner, finally dying with an ulcerated eye, having said nothing coherent. Roche, on the other hand, dies swiftly and gracefully, whispering beautiful last words. Much of the plague section reads realistically (the cows wandering around unmilked), though it's all very repetitive and heavy-handed.Why wasn't Kivrin's translator working in the early parts of her visit to 1348? Was it because the language had shifted so dramatically (something that was, in fact, well foreshadowed) that her language training literally had that little use? The fact that the translator adapted to the spoken language, figuring it all out from context, was a nice bit of SF. But if the language difficulty was due to it being the wrong year, I wanted some mention of it. And with all the repetitive infodumping, I would have liked some attention paid to how a language could shift so much as to be unrecognizable. Perhaps it could--I have no idea--but it isn't so obvious as to be glossed over without mention.Finally, some reviewers have commented on the fact that Basingame is searched for throughout the book, then forgotten. Others have suggested that Roche should have been a future time traveler (else why state THREE TIMES that he prays in the SAME WAY Kivrin talks into her own corder). I was waiting for Roche to *be* Basingame. Alas, that's more of a plot twist than this book could provide.",

                "review/text": "&quot;The Doomsday Book&quot; is an astonishing, gripping, stunning intertwining of time travel with two possible doomsday scenarios, one in the mid-21st century, the other the real Black Death of 1348-49 in England. The student historian Kivrin Engle wants to go to the Middle Ages, and she's supported by a thwarted medievalist, Gilchrist, who finally gets his hands on the power to send her there. Willis kills off quite a few sympathetic characters, in the remorseless fashion of Renaissance tragedy. Others survive, though changed by the action, in the best tradition of comedy. In some ways it's frustrating to read, because almost all the &quot;good&quot; characters are themselves terribly frustrated, but after the first hundred pages this thing is almost impossible to put down. On the 21st century side there are a lot of light, even farcical, touches (for example, the pressing need for &quot;lavatory paper,' and William Gaddson's ability to attract any number of young women) that relieve some of the inevitable grimness enjoined by the circumstances. I read this book, despite its length, in a 24-hour period, and cannot get it out of my mind. The detail is wonderful, the plots are wonderful, the morals strike deeply. What a book!",

It occasionally still drives me nuts waiting for the real action to start, but every time I re-read it I discover something I missed. The writing alone is worth reading just to be enjoyed, even during the slow beginning.I read an incredible amount of historical fiction, and Doomsday Book is one of the only books I've ever read that sounded authentic. For once the medieval characters really seemed medieval, not just 20th century people in costumes. Also about the characters, the reviewers who say they seemed flat must not have been paying enough attention! Sure, a lot of the characters (Gilchrist and Latimer especially) were archetypal. But they all still had enough personality of their own to be very real people. Gilchrist and Latimer almost became sympathetic characters at the end when you realize that they were vulnerable too, which is quite a feat considering how they start out. Several, like Father Roche and Eliwys, are not easily categorized at all. Father Roche was a typical saint-like figure but still was human enough to have carnal thoughts about Kivrin and shout at Imeyne. Eliwys was a loving mother but, firstly, never resolved her feelings about Gawyn (notice the scene where she sends him to Bath to get Guillame) and, secondly, had her own problems and priorities and could sometimes be snobbish or cruel, unlike most stereotypical good mothers. You can also see the family resemblance between her and Rosemund just clearly enough to make it interesting. Connie Willis's people are *human*. They do make dumb mistakes and have personality flaws, just like the rest of us.But what really makes the book great isn't the characters or the story, but the writing. Anybody can write a book about a bunch of medieval villagers, but only Connie Willis could have written the scene where Rosemund dies. It just rips me apart every time. Also the scene where Father Roche quotes Romans to Kivrin after they bury Agnes, when he tries to help her stop being angry at God. And who can read &quot;You are here in place of the friends I love&quot; without crying?What a great book. Everyone should read it. It really does a great job of showing how much all people have in common. It's a nice change to read a SF book with real people and themes in it, not just stereotypes of good and evil and everybody getting exactly what they deserve in the end.",

If you like a good, gut-wrenching cry every now and then, get your Kleenex ready. If you've ever wondered how a carillon-ringing group works, then by all means dive right in.The basic plot of the book is fairly simple by fantasy standards. A modern university student is sent through time to the era of the Black Death, while pestilence sweeps her own era. The action switches back and forth between the two time periods. It sounds basic, but the unparalleled character development and unflinching look at the hardships of life in any century make this book truly unforgettable. Connie Willis's characters are flawed, funny, angry, *human* people who will suck you in to their world without apology.I just cannot praise this book enough.

Remember all those things that Mom said would help you succeed, and those things that might get in your way? Well, we remember some of them, but not all.Create Your Own Luck feels like Mom-or a good friend-giving you lots of perspectives, advice, and cautions. Azriela Jaffe is like a mom-or a good friend-to thousands of people. She's a wife and mother of three children, a nationally syndicated columnist, and coordinator of a wide network of entrepreneurial couples.We've all caught ourselves observing someone's good fortune and exclaiming that the fortunate person is so lucky. Jaffe asserts that creating luck is a skill that we can learn. It's an attitude toward life that we can master and, yes, control our own lives. In this book, she shows us how in a conversational tone that's captivating.The text is interwoven with stories told in the first person. The reading is so comfortable that I was drawn in to a sense of being one-on-one with the author . . . probably curled up in front of the fireplace. One after another, Jaffe shares Luck Builders, the behaviors that attract good luck. Interspersed with these words of encouragement are Luck Busters, warnings about the behaviors that sabotage the good luck you attract, and Luck Blockers, behaviors that repel good luck. Throughout the book are Luck Journal Exercises, suggestions to do things that will help keep your thinking where it needs to be. The book is well-seasoned with thought-provoking quotes.The eight principles, used as the organization of the book, are Open Your Mind, Ask for What You Want and Be Willing to Work to Get It, Pay Attention to Your Intuition and Meaningful Coincidences, Respond to Life's Trials with Resiliency, Take Yourself and Others Off the Hook, Have Patience in the Right Dose, Give and Receive in Equal Measure, and Focus on the Positive.And here's my recommendation, in action form: After I read Create Your Luck, I sent it as a gift to my daughter, Jennifer, a junior in college.",

I was a little bit STUNNED because this book is SO FULL OF TRUTHS that it made me see how many LUCK-BUSTERS and LUCK BLOCKERS I have had in my life... and guess who has created them?--Moi!!...... This is not an easy thing to recognize. It makes you upset and angry with yourself for a while (because deep down in your heart you know this is TRUTH!), but once you LET GO of this anger, you begin to ALLOW good things to be entering your life...... and INDEED, in the past WEEK (since I started reading this book) I've experienced more love and happiness than I have for a LONG LONG TIME :-)This is not because of the book. This is not some MAGICAL BOOK. This book, however, does what only the BEST BOOKS CAN DO... It reminds you of Universal truths that YOU ALREADY KNOW... It does so in a FUN and GENTLE way.... This book was clearly written in the SPIRIT OF LOVE.... It gets my HIGHEST RECCOMENDATION. Anyone, like me, who is on a spiritual path, anyone who is with an OPEN MIND(Principle # 1 of LUCK-CREATION according to the book)... Anyone who likes to be reminded of gentle yet POWERFUL universal truths should read this book!",

I wouldn't be shocked if she persuades J.K. Rowling to write a foreword in her next book.",

If you are a fundamentalist Christian, or an academic type don't bother (its fiction!) you will only be upset if the book doesn't follow your view of the way the world should be. This is a very good beach read, but five years from now no one will remember it so relax!Conclusion: Who cares? This book worked for me. Every time I get weak-minded and listen to how a man (any and all men) say how wonderful he is or how beautiful I am, etc, I pull out this book. Then I allow the more unsuitable men to return back to the common property cesspool from whence they came. The more decent ones are still around. At least we are friends. One is even more.My advice: ignore all the authors' angry critics, (including the women who are mistresses, and man-worshippers who have created and sustained the \"men\" the authors' book continue to screen out). I strongly recommend also STOP GETTING DUMPED.",

You know, the person who doesn't wear designer clothes, or who doesn't imitate those who yet manage some cheap imitation to get their 'friends' approval. Or the individual who dares to 'think'...REALLY think...for him or herself, despite being the 'laughing stock' of his or her 'peers.' Or the person who is continually 'pushing the envelope,' to the rage and fury of those little men in gray suits that skulk along the walls of any large corporation...or around your neighborhood block, for that matter. Of course you know the ones I'm talking about. The REAL Thinker is the odd one out. Why? Because each of us is a mirror to others. And the reflection they see in our mirrors show them what they are and are not, constantly. The \"average;\" the \"normal,\" are generally the ones who never had an original thought in their lives and never will, and yet are so incompetent as to have trouble in stealing ideas from others. Sure, you know the kind. They're all around you! You have to put up with them everyday, just to earn your bread! I'm talking about the \"bastions of society,\" as the herd (or, \"masses\") call the lackluster! Well, this book certainly ISN'T for them!What a pity, that most creative thinkers and doers are (at best) 'tolerated' by saying they, \"think outside the box,\" or (more usually) hated, by being labeled a \"psychopath.\" That's what this book is about. About resurrecting a NATURAL pride in the creative and productive individual...however the individual defines it for him or her self. And that is where it belongs-within the individual who has the courage to become more, do more, and to revel in the process, as much as in the achievement.This book is a rare bird that actually, though fiction decribes what is going on in the world today. It is learning a new field of knowledge, or living a life of dedication, direction, and the courage of one's convictions. But it is necessary reading for all people who MUST be reminded that THEY are the true \"Lords of the Earth,\" not the masses who benefit daily from the joys the 'rejects'...the \"psychopaths\"...continually create in all fields of human endeavor. To these \"crazies,\" I HIGHLY recommend this book! I'd say the courageous and determined among us have both a roadmap and a 'supply line' needed to achieve and become whatever it is we want to do and be...and with no holds barred. And all the while, enjoying who we are, while looking to none of the herd for approval, acceptance...or thanks. I also highly recommend \"Pyschopath\" by Keith Ablow.Cheers",

                "review/text": "This writer in her highly absorbing and comprehensive exposition, attempts to define anti-social dysfunction. Although she also takes into account behaviourist and biologistic explanations of the origin of the disorder (such as frontal-lobe brain disorder and the low Serotonin hypothesis),her main focus is that sociopathy is principally a result of inadequate parenting and poor socialisation. SHe justifies this assertion by quoting statistics which prove that the majority of fearless, aggressive, manipulative impulsive criminals with low I.Q. and little sense of commitment towards jobs, family or others -- (those who are responsible for raising America's crime rate) -- are mainly the result of being brought up in often single-parent households, or else reared by incompetent parents. This leads to delinquency in early youth, as the potential young offender finds no sense of discipline or authority at home, thereby gravitating towards dubious peer groups, such as gangs, who are usually presided upon by older, more mainipulative, though no less intelligent, gangleaders. The author also offers some engrossing insights on the possibility of a genetic component in fluencing psychopathic behaviour,on the hereditability of crime, a topic that has remained highly controversial in criminological circles. Though she denies the existence of a precise gene for 'criminality', thus avoiding the untenable view that criminals consititute a fixed 'type', she writes that genetics do indeed predispose certain individuals towards psychopathic activity. They may, for instance, be more venturesome, more aggressive, more competitive, more egoistic and more impulsive than other children, though these susceptibilities can only develop into criminality due to environmental inputs: - which, as Miss Quintiliano writes, are related to inadequate socialisation and defective parenting styles. The author writes that the same genes, given differing environmental conditioning, can be responsible for breeding either a criminal psychopath or a zealous crime-fighter, and she substantiates this claim by quoting a number of 3 percent. A very well thought out book on this psychopathic behavior. This is a very controversial subject that some people believe that prevention is far better than the cure, and it calls for much needed tax-payer funding for licensed 'parenters' to become the wards of parentless or potentially delinquent children. Otherwise, the majority of psychopathic personalities are incurable, and the only solution would be 'biological-prophylactic' legislation.",

In this book, Chapman invites you to enter the world of strip clubs, pornography and fast money. Raven Klein is a bi-racial teenager who lives in Iowa with her white foster mother who works at a diner. Dealing with racist comments from the local community and being the object of the white boys sexual curiosity, Raven wishes for a better life. One day she hops a bus, leaving Iowa behind to search for a place where she can connect with her African American roots. A chance meeting with Nia at the bus station leads Raven to Atlanta. What she finds there is a drama filled life that includes sex, money and intrigue.Nia, a former stripper turned music video dancer, has dreams of becoming an R&B; singer. Nia is the top girl in Rico's harem of strippers. No longer having to strip for Rico, Nia has enough pull with him to offer Raven a place to stay and assistance with a job. After reneging on a promise to Rico, Nia's role as Rico's top girl is quickly replaced by Raven.Rico is the owner of two Atlanta area strip clubs, one for the everyday working man and another for stars in the music and sports industry. When he recognizes what an asset Raven is to his business, he gives her part ownership in the clubs and even proposes marriage.Tyanna, Nia's tri-sexual friend (she'll try anything sexually), brings in big dollars for Raven. Having once sought revenge on Raven for causing Nia to lose her position with Rico, Tyanna later realizes that Raven has her back as well as Nia after she performs several favors for them. Tyanna returns the favors by helping to save her from a deadly situation.I was truly caught up in this book. The erotic scenes were hot! Murder, blackmail and deception spices the story as Raven finds true love. Nia receives the fame that she seeks and Rico gets what is coming to him when his actions catch up with him. The plot contained lots of twists and turns up until the very end. I am looking forward to reading more from this author.Reviewed by Paula Henderson for Loose Leaves Book Review",

                "review/text": "I see this book has received a mixed response from fans, and this surprises me. I found this to be one of the most entertaining reads in a long while. I keep reading it over and over, sometimes skipping to my favorite parts and analyzing the details for further insight.Following a rather slow beginning (I'd almost suggest skipping the first chapter), we encounter a slimy tabloid reporter who, due to an experiment run amok by an amateur scientist he's sent to interview, becomes doomed to sail randomly through parallel universes, many of which are at least as weird as the kinds of stories he writes for the tabloid paper. Each of these universes contains another version of himself, living life without any awareness of anything strange going on around him. (That is not the only one of the reporter's new &quot;powers,&quot; but I don't want to give away the most original aspect of this novel.)What I love about all of Foster's books is that his descriptions are so vivid, he makes the comically absurd seem almost plausible. You feel like you've lived in one of his books after reading it. Not only does he revel in verbose descriptions, he always seems to be pushing the limits of what's possible to put into words. His stories are often filled with &quot;shocker lines,&quot; not all of which work, but are nonetheless very enjoyable.In &quot;Parallelities,&quot; each universe the reporter protagonist visits seems to encompass a story in itself, and in the process the book manages to cross several genres, leaving open more questions than it answers. The book is hilarious, because the reporter keeps convincing himself he's finally back in his own world, but we know he's only fooling himself. Every time he thinks his life has returned to normal, he's only about to encounter something substantially weirder than anything before. These sequences play off like one of those dreams where you think you're awake, but then you notice some small discrepancy and everything comes crashing down.This is the kind of book that draws heavily upon the notion of existential angst. If countless parallel universes exist, each one as &quot;real&quot; as any other, and countless versions of oneself exist, where is there room for personal identity? It is heavily implied that there might be practically, if not actually, an infinite number of these universes in existence, which would make this universe equivalent to a grain of sand on a vast beach. If that is the case, how can the cosmos have any meaning, at least to the extent that humans can comprehend it?Just as there are multiple universes in this book, there are multiple explanations for the nature and extent of the protagonist's problems, and toward the end it starts to get a little confusing. Every time I read the book, however, I notice new things. For example, each time he visits the scientist who brought about his problems, he fails to take notice of subtle differences in the furniture, not to mention the scientist's personality. Still, there are a lot of questions I haven't answered to this day, and I'm not even sure Foster himself would know the answer.Despite the philosophical theme of chaos, the reporter's fate is almost a fitting punishment for someone so shallow and unethical. That's why it's not unpleasant to read about what's basically a fate worse than death. (In fact, it is hinted at one point that even death wouldn't necessarily get rid of his problem.) Toward the end of the book, due to certain events I won't describe, he starts to become painfully aware of his own flaws. I must say this is one of the most well-developed characters I've ever encountered in an Alan Dean Foster book, for he comes off as very real, not as a mere stereotype. Even though he's not that sympathetic, he's sufficiently ordinary enough that we can relate to him.At one point in the story, the reporter visits what appears to be a utopian version of his own world. Naturally, he wishes that he'd remain there permanently, but the irony is that he would never fit into such a world, because he isn't good enough.",

But there are few new plotlines, what counts is what you do with it.And in my opinion, Foster doesn't do very much at all with this one.To begin with, Maxwell Parker is not what you'd call a sympathetic character. Being a tabloid reporter, he's more than a little bit of a sleaze. Self-centered, egotistical, in love with himself, he's not someone you hang around with if you have a choice. And while this changes a little during the course of the book (nothing like meeting dozens of copies of yourself to give you a good feel for your weak points) , in the end, all Max really wants to do is go right back to the life he had before this all started, and in the meantime, all he's really doing is moping a lot. Self-centered depression is not what I call an ideal character development.In fact, if I had to sum up what Max learns through all this it's &quot;There's no place like home,&quot; a lesson The Wizard of Oz taught with much nicer characters - and which I have reservations about even there.Foster introduces entirely too many characters that do a brief walk-on, set up themselves somewhat, and then are never seen again. I understand that most of these characters are &quot;paras&quot; that will vanish before the end of the chapter (by the very nature of the story), but it still feels like Foster is setting up someone to use and then just discarding them.The whole book, in fact, is (over) loaded with long, winding, witty descriptives. It looks like Foster was trying to do the type of writing Terry Pratchett does in his Diskworld series (and other places). But Foster just doesn't quite manage it.Mind you. This isn't a horrible book, nor one you'll read halfway through and then toss across the room in disgust. It's just a bland, rather pointless meander that probably could have been done better as a short story or novella.",

I usually read books of Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler variety, but I was bored and it was there. As I started to read I was immediatly brought into a world where, at least for one man, the whole world changes in a second. So it's a desperate struggle for him to try and discover who he really is, and where he is really from. Along the way he encounters aliens, ghosts, other versions of himself (including a female one), and even a world occupied entirely by versions of himself!!! I enjoyed the small bits of humour thrown in and the actual science was kept to minimum. I highly suggest this book, no matter what you usually read, you will enjoy it!!!!!",

                "review/text": "Reviewed by Zane for RAW SISTAZ BOOK CLUBThere are some books that seem partially real and then there are books that seem so real that they have you limbering somewhere between trepidation and awe. Such is the case with Whoreson. From the first chapter, I was hooked when I discovered that the main character's birth name was actually Whoreson. His mother, Jessie, a prostitute, selected that name after she gave birth to him less than an hour after turning a trick. Jessie, along with her mentor Big Mama, raised her son to do one thing: become a pimp. He studied it like an art form, learned from those he considered the masters, and got his Ph.D. in Pimpology. There are numerous women in this novel with low to non-existent self-esteem that allowed Whoreson to turn them into prostitutes when he was too young to even get a driver's license. Especially Boots, whom Whoreson meets while she is pregnant and still tricking for her rent. For those who have ever wondered what makes a person decide to stand on a street corner, whether male or female, and sell their bodies for money, this book offers a significant insight into their lives. This is not a pretty book, but being that the author lived the majority of it, makes it remarkable. Whoreson, a semi-autobiographical novel that Goines wrote while he was incarcerated at the Jackson Penitentiary, is a fictional masterpiece. In and out of jail seven times, Donald Goines was shot and killed in Detroit in 1974 while he sat at his typewriter working on his latest novel. Having sold upwards of 10 million books worldwide, even though he has been given very little recognition in American media, I truly believe that we lost one of the best AA authors in history too young and too tragically. I can only imagine how many other masterpieces he could have churned out, being that he wrote as many as eight in one year. There is no one to compare him to. To even attempt to compare him to another author would be an injustice. If you haven't been turned onto Donald Goines yet, you are missing a world of incredible literature.I give Whoreson a 5 on the RAW Scale.",

I would say this is my favorite Donald Goines book but I'd be lying because I liked &quot;Black Girl Lost&quot; and &quot;Dopefiend&quot; as much as I liked Whoreson. Whoreson was better though because it was a longer book. In the book Whoreson we get to see Whoreson grow up from a small boy into a &quot;Man&quot;, why he was named Whoreson and why he was born a Pimp/street hustler. And that he really had no other choice in life. Thats all he knew. Something about Whoreson's character makes you like him even though he is ignorant as hell. There are lots of twists and turns, excitement as well as let downs that makes you just want to keep reading. As I said before it is a book for a mature reader as the sex and violence is harsh. I really enjoyed reading Donald Goines books and am reading &quot;Black Gangster&quot; and &quot;Cry Revenge&quot; right now so far they are worth the money I spent and exciting reads as well.",

The first time I read this book I was very young, at that time it was exciting because I knew that I shouldn't have been reading the book in the first place. (Kinda like sneaking and listening to Richard Pryor records when no one was around) I was amazed with the fast pace of the book and all of the underhandedness of the main character.Once I got older I was able to appreciate the author's writing style. In all my years of reading I have never read anything that was as clear and concise as Mr. Goines' novels. His writing is so clear, its like you are apart of the story. Almost like the story is unfolding right before your very eyes. Not only do you feel as though you know each of the characters, you get a sense of familiarity of the surroundings. I have never been to Detroit MI, a day in my life. But I can envision each scene, each street corner, each alley and every building that was mentioned in this book.I must say that not all writers have the capability of great story telling, nor do all writers have the capability of good writing style, well Mr. Goines had both.This generations of writers seem to be patterning after the same style of writing and the same story line. Every once in a while we should step back in time and take a look at something original. Read something from someone with ingenuity and originality, someone who definitely had a flare for writing. And from a writer who wasn't afraid of telling his story the way he wanted it told. Maybe I am a little prejuiced, but damn that man could write !!!!!",

At the end, Whoreson, may in one aspect lost as far as being sent to prison. But actually, he really won, because he finally came to grips with what he had become, how he had gotten to that point. As well as what he hoped for the future. I was also glad that he had gotten the right woman in the end. Lastly, I also liked how Goines showed the love that Jesse and Whoreson shared for each other. This displayed the bond between mother/child which weighs heavily in the black community. As well as the strong love between a black woman and a black man(Whoreson and Janet). Superb ending!!",

Whoreson is vicious and unrepentant - not much internal struggle takes place within him regarding the violence he perpetrates and I accept that's what he is BUT then he goes on to say he can love and change hmmm - which is he? Loving and thoughtful or callous and vicious?I think his character's behaviour could have been explained in more depth to make him more loveable and better understood even when he is bad so that when he decides to change the process is smoother and more believable.",

I found myself while reading the book dutifully from beginning to end, often going back and rereading sections.THE AUTHOR REVEALS HER INSECURITIES AND THEY ALL SEEM SO FAMILIAR. However, what got me, was that the author was not a young woman. She is in her late 50s, early 60s. So much for outgrowing them. Well, I had hoped. She examined these insecurities and failings in a sense from a view, I had not expected; as if they were assets. Now that's a thought. She had difficulty accepting this notion at first and the book subtly pushes this to the forefront again and again. Fascinating.THE AUTHOR'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HER ADULT SON IS MARKED WITH MIS-COMMUNICATIONS THAT DOMINATED THEIR PREVIOUS INTERATIONS. However, by turning off the critic to herself, she was more accepting and could &quot;hear&quot; others better. This greatly helped her and her son communicate on a new level. Any parent who has children making that change from child to adult could really use help here. Any help.THERE ARE PARTS OF THIS BOOK THAT MADE ME LAUGH OUT LOUD AND OTHERS THAT WERE POIGNANT. The author relates a story, where she hires a professional organizer and within moments of this woman starting to do her job, pays her to stop and leave. The author realized that she did not want to have her organization methods changed, but wanted a different outcome using the same methods... Don't we all. Change requires...Change.THERE ARE SO MANY WONDERFUL POINTS MADE IN THIS BOOK, A REVIEW, SHY OF RECREATING THE BOOK, CAN'T DO THEM JUSTICE. The best a reviewer can say is Read this book, read it slow and think about it. It is very Zen Buddist in philosophy and gives great weight to the day to day things. However, unlike &quot;Sweeping changes&quot; a book centered in Zen philosophy around house cleaning and maintenance, this book does not focus so much on day to day activities directly, but the philosophies of day to day relationships with people. The word Synchronicity comes to mind here.I PLAN TO RE-READ THE BOOK IN A MONTH OR SO. Books like this change in time. Next time I could write an entirely different review because different things will catch my eye.

A way free of sin, guilt, exclusion, boring TV, AND yet full of fun, joyful work, ways to lift ourselves up, ways to fulfill our human lives.I enjoyed \"The Celestine Prophesy\". That book was distributed at first in off Main Street \"New Age\" bookstores and leapt off the shelves. The author was amazed and went on to sell millions.The \"Kin\" is far more expansive, joyful, than the \"Prophesy\" for me. For those of you who know, what more can I say? For those who don't and are in search for a more meaningful life, buy, lease, or borrow this book.By the time you have read twenty pages, you will thank me and kiss my ring. Since I wear no ring, your buying this amazing book will be our mutual gift to one another.... I do not know how to reassure you on this point. Perhaps a little (very little in our society) trust is in order. You must decide.This is a joy filled adventure. Easy to read. Just over 200 pages in length. Very easy to read.

                "review/text": "Dorothy Bryant, who hales from the planet Berkeley, has written several novels that are so startlingly different from each other than it makes you wonder how one person could have achieved this feat.I don't like fantasy genre books, not at all. But just because Bryant had written this, I swallowed hard and read it. Oh boy. It's wonderful. It's the tale of a wretched man who seems to have killed not only his girlfriend but also himself. But he rouses from his `swoon' in a strange world where there are no signs of ugliness or violence - and the rest of the novel plays with the question of how he will fare in such an unfamiliar environment.I strongly recommend three of her other books. The Garden of Eros (a personal favorite; I'm a midwife, and there's a fantastic description of an unattended birth in this book), Miss Giardino, and Ella Price's Journal. Dorothy Bryant created her own publishing company, Ata Books, in Berkeley because of her desire to help local writers get published and to keep their books in print and on local bookstore shelves indefinitely.",

                "review/text": "It is a lovely book... somewhat surreal and definitely Utopian in theme but Bryant takes you so gently and slowly to her thesis that it's ultimately easy-to-swallow. Reflection over time, however, yields a few problems.As another reviewer has pointed out, Bryant uses a dispicable character to explain and augment the premise for the culture of Ata; many readers will find it hard to sympathize with his supposed enlightenment. Also, the id is completely glossed over in this book, the idea being that proper socialization within such a Utopian culture would erase or negate animalistic urges down to permanently manageable magnitude; many readers will question her conclusion in that regard and doubts will emerge on the entire premise. Lastly, the protagonists obtuse nature makes the book plod a bit; many readers will \"get it\" right away and be annoyed with how long it takes the main character to catch up (which in some respects he never really does)Then there's the attitude of the Kin of Ata themselves. While beautiful and loving and empathic and yadda yadda, they can easily come across as lackadaisical or just plain apathetic. While much is made of their near-telepathic \"oneness\" and reliance upon their spiritual nature, their repeated indulgence of the main character becomes tiresome.... have they no self-preservation? No passion? No overriding discipline? These questions are best exemplified by the fact that the Ata see no benefit from the notion of the written word. Much is made of their connection to one another; their oral history that becomes the art of storytelling etc. Apparently, historical fact-keeping is anathema to Utopia. I found that notion to be impossible to accept. Within the framework of a people absolutely cut-off from \"modern\" societies influence perhaps that could MAYBE be true, but one does not simply dismiss an obstacle to spiritual awakening by pushing it out of view. This comes across as a basic ostrich manuever to avoid facing the difficult realities of human natures: heirarchical thinking, competiveness and basic surivival needs that when unmet turn to aggression and antagonistic behavior. Those may not be pleasant realities but they are realities.For a more interesting (and possibly more intellectual) take on the same notion, try out Herland by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Although her victorian attitudes about female sexuality date the piece, all other aspects of her Utopia seem more plausible to me. Which is saying something, really.Actually, I'd be more enthusiastic to recommend The Dispossessed (or nearly anything by Ursula K LeGuin) or Wild Seed (or nearly anything by Octavia Butler) as both (the books and the writers) explore the notion of a Utopian ideal by handing it to humanity via an alien race who are well aware of the not-so-nice aspects of human nature. Both writers understand that some unsavory elements are iron-clad stuck in us, not just taught to us.By keeping the Utopianists as human as anyone else, we beg the question \"why do those humans never fight, never hurt each other and how would they deal with a natural disaster?\" which never seems to be answered by Utopian writers adequately. By beginning enlightenment with an outside species/race, we change the question to \"can humanity resist its negative tendancies in order to accept this Utopia?\" which is imminently more interesting and quite possibly answerable on some level.The Kin of Ata... neither addresses nor firmly answers these questions, which is it's only flaw. For fantasy, however, it sure is a wonderful read.",

                "review/text": "This is my favorite dream-inspired work of fiction, and it has been a major influence on my own approach to dreaming, as explained in my books CONSCIOUS DREAMING and DREAMGATES. Dorothy Bryant shows us that the first key to creating a dreaming culture is to open a safe space between people every day in which dreams can be shared and honored. If we can bring this about in our families, our schools, our work environments and our communities, we will take a tremendous step towards manifesting a more generous, spirited and compassionate society where we can move decisively beyond barriers of prejudice and misunderstanding. We will also bring gifts of storytelling and sponteneous healing into our everyday lives.The second aspect of Dorothy Bryant's vision of compelling interest today is that she beautifully portrays the possibility that the dreamworld is the REAL world, and that &quot;big&quot; dreams are real experiences in which we enter other dimensions, encounter other beings, and recollect our spiritual purpose. A sensitive movie version of this book would be a much-needed counterpoint to the film &quot;The Matrix&quot;, where the reality behind physical appearances is depicted as nightmarish, and an antidote to the consensual hallucination that dreams are &quot;only&quot; dreams.",

                "review/text": "One reading of this book is a modern Utopia. It's a place built on peace: happy, pastoral, multiracial, communal, and sexually liberated. The people are so viscerally in tune with their environment that they very nearly hibernate through the cold season and usually bear their young in the spring. The whole populace is dedicated to their dreams, to sharing their dreams, and to living more deeply in their dreams.A man from our outer world appears in that place, not the kind you'd want as your representative. He can not see into their depths, and violates one of the women who tends him. These peaceful people still accept him, though, and envelop him in their way. After many years, he finds his place among them. He also finds the true meaning of this Eden, a power and an ongoing place in the world that he never imagined.I'm still not quite sure what to make of this book. It comes from the hippy/commune era around 1970, and carries the indelible mark of its time. It's a bit simplistic at times, and only the first-person character is developed in any depth. This is a bit more than the common Utopia story, a bit more optimistic and a bit more magical.The very worst you can say about this is that it's light and readable, even enjoyable if you let yourself enjoy it. The story of personal transformation has been told before and is told well here. I guess real point is that this little land of loving dreamers is itself a dream worth having.//wiredweird",

Instead, he mysteriously finds himself in the land of Ata. Thus, begins this fantastical Utopian tale.The book is simply written and chronicles one man's entry into a world where the dream state is reality. It is a world where unconditional acceptance of others prevails, and symbolically all are spokes in the circular wheel of life. Much of the book is redolent of Christian ideals. How much of Ata is in this man's mind and how much of it is truly real, I leave to the individual reader to discern.

I think we can all learn valuable lessons from the wonderful people of Ata. For a similar type of story, I also recommend Marlo Morgan's Mutant Message Down Under.My main critique of the story is that it is told through the eyes of a lying, thieving, raping, sexist, murdering, privileged, white man, and though he supposedly was changed by his experience on Ata, I never could grow to like him or develop any empathy for him. He later forms a &quot;relationship&quot; with a woman, Augustine, on Ata and I could not bring myself to believe that the characters really shared any love. It seemed like Augustine just went along with whatever the raping, thieving, slime-bucket guy wanted. I wondered about that aspect of Augustine's character and what the author intended to convey by portraying her that way.Perhaps I need to read it again and ponder that, as well as the question of why Ms. Bryant chose such a reprehensible main character to tell her fascinating story.

Also included are sections on First Aid, &quot;Stalking the Wild Submissive,&quot; (very important!) and ways to do scenes that are exciting both for the Dominant and the submissive.I felt the chapter that John's wife, Libby wrote (A Submissive Writes About Submission) gives an excellent insight for Dominants into what (at least for her) submission means and what it's about.This book's second edition is now available on Greenery Press and it's an excellent addition to any kinkster's library, whether they are Dom, sub, or switch.Also recommended: SM101 by Jay Wiseman; Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns by Philip Miller &amp; Molly Devon",

The comprehensive treatise on safety deals with psychological safety as well as phsyical safety - something that, while desperately needed, has been overlooked in most other attempts at this very difficult subject. Yes, BDSM is a difficult undertaking as it requires not only deep knowledge but even deeper caring and ethics. Knowing that your Dominant is concerned and knowledgable in, and for safety, will create a bond of trust. A big step for a lasting relationship! The section written BY a submissive is a stroke of genius for the purposes of providing the submissive POV. Imagine! a book that tries to teach the Dominant what a submissive sees and feels. Understanding the submissive mind is a powerful tool for a Dominant that truly cares.I would combine this book with Jay Wiseman's &quot;S/M-101&quot; as the foundation for a beginners' entry into Domination and submission. Seeing these two books on the shelf of a Domme will perk my interest in persuing a relationship.

It is a no non-sense work in which aspects of BDSM are covered. Whether it be games to play in the playroom like whipping or bondage to the intricate relationship between a dominant and their submissive. I had a great time reading this book and I learned a lot about the subject. I would highly recommend this book to anyone at all even remotely interested in BDSM. In fact I would have given this book 5 stars but for one reason, whoever was the proofreader missed so many obvious spelling and punctuation errors that it continually drove me to distraction. I would be avidly reading a section and then WHAM, a spelling mistake. The first few times I ignored it, after that it got really annoying. Grammatical errors aside, I would still recommend this book to anyone and in fact already have recommended it to several of my friends. My copy is currently on loan to a friend in Indiana (and I am not sure that I will ever get it back, he said he wanted to borrow it to a friend in Michigan).

While this might be forgiveable in a first edition and I highly stress the word might, it is unacceptable in a second edition.

I guess that would describe this book. It seems like a random collection of thoughts hastily thrown together and, at least to me, seems more the subject for a vanity press than anything else. John Warren is definitely full of himself and what he feels is his expertise. I think the added publication, in yet another appendix of raw survey data without any analysis was meant to reinforce the validity of his statements. His partner's contribution is little more than touchy feely new-age crap and cheesy song titles that only demonstrate their lack of knowledge of good music. I gave it 3 stars although maybe 2 or 2.5 would be sufficient. This book is a quick easy read and, by and large, harmless but it is a far cry from a definitive introduction into the world of BDSM.

It masterfully blends truth and fiction in such a way that you are drawn into the life story of Edwin Mullhouse. Beyond the descriptive imagery, which is fantastic, and brought back many of my own memories of childhood, this book plays with form, in that it is a FICTIONAL account written in the style of a classic English biography. The narrator is a child, but writes in an adult manner, giving detailed accounts and analysis to such events in Edwin's life as how he learned to speak, his first comic book, and the first great love of his life (in 1st grade).This juxtaposition of adult analysis with childish feelings, toys, and concerns makes a great new form of &quot;fictional biography&quot;I also loved the &quot;physicality&quot; of words that exists in this work. Edwin, just learning to write, can't help seeing words as pictures. For example, &quot;yellow&quot; is a boat with a rudder and two smoke stacks and &quot;bed&quot; is two fat men looking at each other over a table. Edwin is fascinated with cartoons and comics and writes his masterpiece, &quot;Cartoons&quot; when he is just 11. This is basically a very detailed account of a cartoon. I LOVED IT! To &quot;read&quot; a cartoon and see it in your head as you read brings a new dimension to the printed page. The words become images and the images are words. Great reading, and highly recommended for any serious writer or anyone who wants to remember their childhood....(note: I picked up this book when I heard Charles Frazier was reading it; he wrote Cold Mountain---not only a great author, but a great book critic it seems ;)",

Myself nine years--almost to the day--younger than Edwin, I nevertheless found the account of a Connecticut childhood in the late 1940s and early 1950s eerily evocative of my own experiences on the other coast, which probably says a bit more about the relative stasis and the enforced conformity in which the surface of the country's middle class existed during that period than about my particular and individual receptivity to author Steven Millhauser's prose. Ah, but it is splendid prose indeed, and summoned up for me the vivid sense of, for example, the classrooms of the period. A more perceptive reviewer than the one I savaged above alluded to Nabokov's \"Pale Fire,\" and that comparison is spot on. Part of the joke is that \"Jeffrey Cartwright,\" who tells our story, is a humorless pedant fit to stand beside Charles Kinbote as a Nabokovian (or for that matter Jamesian) unreliable narrator (and for those who aren't disposed to get the joke, there's the scholarly 1972 Introductory Note by \"Walter Logan White\"--that year's \"John Ray, Jr.\"), whose approach to his material is that of a dutiful grind of a grad student, as author Millhauser was himself at that time.This is a beautifully evocative and fanciful portrait of the artist at American mid-century. I don't know whether it will resonate quite the same way with readers born after, say, 1956, but given that Jane Austen stays in print even though the grandchildren of her original readership have all perished, I venture to hope that \"Edwin Mullhouse\" will find new readers throughout this century.

There are a million great things I can say about this book, (the descriptions, the subtle parody of adult life, the weird set pieces) but I'll just confine myself to the fact that in this novel - like the last book I totally fell in love with, Infinite Jest two years back - all of the really important parts are not written on the page, but in your head. It's not an easy book, like much of Millhauser's work. I almost wish that he didn't win the Pulitzer, after wading through the comments of the legions of knuckleheads who picked up \"Martin Dressler\" because of its cred and got ticked because it wasn't The Alienist. Parts are confusing and discursive, though never without an inevitable point, and some of the long descriptive passages become interesting only the second time through. Which, for me, began the second I finished the last page. Really, this is an amazing, criminally neglected masterpiece. Reading it is like getting a slow-motion punch to the face. There``s plenty of time to get out of the way, but something compels you to wait and find out if it's actually going to hurt that much when it hits. And, of course, it does - and when the inevitable shot rings out, it's the reader that's pulling the trigger. END",

Jeffrey Cartwright was hoping his friend, Edwin, was going to become a major literary figure to whom Jeffrey could serve as Boswell. When Jeffrey finally figured out that Edwin was not a genius, Jeffrey lost it and killed Edwin. He then wrote this biography trying to pass off Edwin's inanities as genius so as to salvage his own need to have been in the presence of greatness.Many are right in saying that this book provides a powerful evocation of childhood. But at its core, Millhauser has written a clever, biting satire lampooning the need of so many of us to be in the presence of greatness and the bitterness that follows when we find we have been deceived.I can understand negative reviews by those who missed the nasty conceit underlying this seeming tale of childhood innocence. But I was dumbfounded that not one of the many positive reviews picked up on it.

(Nothing is given away here, it's said in the first paragraph.) Millhauser weaves together a tale that, while intently focused, is incredibly reflexive, to the point where the author's intent seems to be to call to attention the art of biography as much as the art of creative writing.The ages of the characters are highly important. If they were older, Rose Dorn and all of Edwin's other obsessions would be out of place. However, we almost understand everything that Edwin goes through, while Jeffrey (the biographer and Edwin's best friend) is left to puzzle it out. Jeffrey's memory is brought into question not by himself, but by his insistance that it is infallible. And, often, it is impeccable at remembering details of early childhood, as far as we know. His intentions are honorable, but just how far can we trust him?The other notable thing in this book is the language. Millhauser's words are vibrant, whether describing a closed down amusement park or a cartoon or the haunting of a writer. Where else can one find a line such as: &quot;And you see, there are all these words, nothing but words, nothing but words, what are these words, and there they are, so that's what you're faced with, words, words...&quot;This book is magic.

Jeffrey may be a literary \"device\", but he's also Edwin's best friend, just as Rose is the love of Edwin's young life. Millhauser knows that children have full emotional lives, and as we get older, we're lucky if we can hang on to at least some of that childhood intensity.This book means so much to me, because it's about a child who gets to fully express his genius (and all of us are \"geniuses\" until adolescence kicks in, and we start to doubt ourselves).",

Fuller finds his passage again with the aid of a woman( well a couple of women actually )and once again returns to his old self.This is a hugely simplified synopsis as this book has many sub-stories and twists.

I was not disappointed. *The Basic Eight* is a gem of a book. It grows on you as you read, building eventually into a book that cannot be put down--particularly toward the end of October in the narrative--and it leaves you thinking about it long after you've read the last page.Mr. Handler, moreover, is a wonderful writer. The plotting of the book is masterful, and the pages are littered with beautiful, apt phrases/sentences--pearls, one might say--which one wants to linger over--over which one wants to linger. (For example, on p. 280: \"I craned my neck to see who this person was, raised by wolves in some San Francisco wilderness and finally escaping by public transportation.\")Some reviewers have complained of inconsistencies in the narrative over the figure of Natasha--I'll not be more specific, as this isn't a spoiler. But, while I haven't reread the book to verify that everything is thus explicable, I think the point is that the whole story is being told through Flan's rather unreliable perspective.

Mortified that I am three times the recommended age group for the books, I was delighted to find that the author, Daniel Handler, had also written a book for grown-ups. The Basic Eight had a difficult time being published, as most editors didn't understand that a book about teenagers was not actually \"young adult\" fiction.The Basic Eight has all the clever in-jokes that hallmark the Lemony Snicket series, but oddly enough, not the complete absurdity of The Austere Academy. This is probably due to this book being a very thinly veiled lampoon of the author's own high school, so at times, one feels not unlike an Adam State, an outsider to the sniggering secret jokes of the clique. Which is not to say that the book isn't enjoyable, but it would probably be a howler had you suffered under the real-life pervy Carr or ineffectual Mokie.The writing style is fabulous, with the grammatical hyper-corrections and the satire of the \"study questions\" which always irritated me in my high school advanced Literature courses. What lets me down with this book is NOT the twist at the end, but the shoddy explanation of it. Other people have drawn the parallel to Fight Club, and it's a good example to use - in Palahniuk's work, you can go back and see Tyler was a figment of the imagination. In the Basic Eight, the characters do not interact with the imaginary character off-screen; she is seemingly a living, breathing (and swilling) part of the group. Yes, Flannery is sick and deluded, but still, the whole dual personality thing could have been handled in a more slick manner.While cultural parodies such as Dr Moprah may fade in time, they will still be understood as part of a certain genre. Future generations may not know who the great O was, but they will have heard of the ugly chatshow industry that revealed the sick voyeuristic and moralistic nature of our society.For a first book, The Basic Eight is pretty good, and makes me look forward to more works by this author, be they for kiddies or for adults.(Oh, and absinthe is not nearly as exciting or deadly as Handler paints it - it actually tastes vile, even if the ceremony involving the slotted spoon and sugar cubes make it a fun little digestif. I know, I know, Handler was choosing an oblique literary reference and not an actual street drug, but just in case anyone was wondering. You can get a cheap imitation of Absinthe in the Czech Republic, but there are also special places in France to get the \"real\" thing, wormwood and all.)",

I have to say that this book was just plain well written and drags you into its world, even if (like me) you might have preferred to stay out. The emotional candor the narrator speaks with (with which the narrator speaks) while losing control of her mind is terrifying and absorbing.There are a few clevernesses sprinkled about that call more attention to the author than the story (the last time I saw him was at the corner of California and Styx?

However, this adds perfectly to the darkness and foreboding of the book's climax.Handler captures the essence of high school friendship and heartbreak with great sympathy and I found that even the mundane events of the story touched my heart.\"The Basic Eight\" is the most tragic and beautiful book I have ever read.

                "review/text": "My first introduction to this author was via his bestseller Sleepers which, I have been quoted as saying, was one of the best books I've ever read. While I had high expectations at the start of this book, I wasn't disappointed as many other reviewers seem to have been. I almost feel as if I have to justify my 5 star rating. I knew nothing was going to be as good as Sleepers, so I kept an open mind while reading. In my estimation, Carcaterra cannot disappoint me because his storytelling expertise is unparalleled. Since I am not reviewing this book based on the number of cliches nor am I expecting a great literary masterpiece, my enjoyment factor alone warrants the 5 stars given.In the first part of the book, we are introduced to six characters, each of which was a great cop at one point in their lives. Unfortunately, things happen, cops get hurt and these six cops are forced to collect their pensions, lick their wounds and perform jobs that are less than enjoyable than their previous employment with the NYPD. While they are still physically alive, they feel dead inside. Each of them had an expertise and it is this expertise that will bring them together once again as a renegade crime stopping unit called Apaches. They are not sanctioned by the police department but still have enough connections to be able to call in the favors necessary to enable them to perform their mission.They have some great nicknames as well -- Boomer, Dead-Eye, Pins, Geronimo, Reverend Jim and Mrs. Columbo. Carcaterra introduces you to each character individually and you feel an immediate connection. Since the premise of the book is about disabled cops, you read each chapter with trepidation knowing full well that doom is imminent just around the corner. As the Apaches, they get involved with trying to stop a drug trafficking ring led by a woman, named Lucia, out of her homebase in Arizona. Her tentacles stretch all the way across the country but then so do theirs. There's one other member in their group and he isn't a cop at all -- not by any stretch of the imagination. His name is Nunzio and he is the owner of an Italian restaurant where the Apaches meet. Lucia's connections can't compare to Nunzio's if you catch my drift.While some of this book is definitely gruesome, the characters are so inspiring in not only trying to right a wrong but in the way they need their cop work to keep them alive. Unfortunately, throughout the entire book, you just know that they won't all come out alive and therein lies the dilemma -- who's going to die and who's going to live. Once again, Carcaterra has done it for me. I just love the way he tells a story. He makes me feel as if I know each character as a friend and I couldn't ask any more from an author.",

Six supercops, all of whom have had to retire due to job-related injuries, form a secret crime-fighting unit in which they aim to take down a hyperbolically sinister (and beautiful!) drug lord (drug lady?)during the early days of the crack epidemic. No cliche is too obvious for Carcaterra as these psychically and physically-scarred cops come back to life now that they can do the thing they were born to do - bring down bad guys. It is hard to take a book like this seriously, and perhaps it would have worked if Carcaterra hadn't taken it seriously himself, but are we supposed to believe these two-dimensional cartoonish characters? And what about the villains, who murder babies to use their hollowed-out bodies as drug mules? Didn't anyone think that life-like dolls would probably be more convincing than actual dead babies?I also found it troubling how Carcaterra needed to have token members of major police minority groups: an African-American, a Latino, and a woman. I'm all for inclusiveness, but here it felt so tokenish as to border on being offensive. Why only one of each minority? The answer, sadly, is that the reader would not have been able to keep two black or two Latino characters separate since, for Carcaterra, these people are no more than the sum of their ethnicity. I also found it fascinating that the only woman cop has the nickname &quot;Mrs. Columbo,&quot; named after the character from the TV show. In other words, Carcaterra can only imagine a woman as a cop so long as she is emulating a man. Sad, narrow-minded stuff.",

Even though some readers complained of the graphic and sometimes unbelievable crimes that were committed in the story(but shouldn't you stop to think that crimes like those do go on in society)but coming from a seventeen year old's point of view I think that the story is all together brilliant. The passion these police officers had before they were put out of commission, I have never seen in a police officer out of the world of fantasy. These officers strived to at least make one last difference in their world before they had to live in it without feeling the satisfaction of knowing they made it safe for future citizens and themselves. The lifestyle they had to take because of their injuries could not feed the hunger and feeling they missed of bringing down a criminal. The way &quot;Pins and &quot;Geronimo&quot; died was very moving because of the way they shared that special moment right before they died. Also the way &quot;Boomer&quot; and Mrs. Columbo carried their secret love for each other all the way till the end was just so breathtaking. I would recommend it to any high school student or a person of any age, believe me you won't regret reading this book. If I had it my way I would give it ten stars.

Reading \"One\" twenty years later made me feel ashamed of the opportunities I had let slip past, and of the neglectful way I often treat my future self. It also renewed my resolve to take responsibility for my every dream, doubt, achievement, and failure. And it made me appreciate Richard Bach that much more for writing the two books that have most influenced my outlook on life.Every choice you make in every moment of your life, whether it's your whim to smile at a stranger in an elevator, your last-minute decision to eat a healthy meal instead of an artery-clogging one, or your whim to read one book and not another affects more than your next few seconds or minutes or hours. It can affect your entire future and the lives of others. I missed this point when I read \"Illusions\"; \"One\" drove it home.\"One\" isn't as tidy as \"Illusions.\" It introduces a lot of ideas but doesn't follow through on some of them to the extent that \"Illusions\" did. You may find this either a blessing or a curse, depending on how much material you need before you can run with it on your own.There's a lot more to the book than what I've mentioned. Some of it bored me and some of it even annoyed me, but that happens when we listen to our best friends speak with candor. Maybe it was something I already knew; maybe it was something I'm not ready to know yet; or maybe it was just plain wrong. Bach shares his soul generously and we're free to take it or leave it. What we learn, or fail to learn, from an experience is also a choice. What I learned in \"One\" may escape your notice entirely. What I failed to learn may be your epiphany.Or not.

As in two of his other books, Illusions: The Tale of a Reluctant Messiah and Jonathan Livingston Seagull, Richard Bach uses flight maturely and appropriately as a chance to learn without the constraints of earth, or reality. As the plane he and his wife are flying in disappears from radar and reality, they have the chance to see the infinite possibilities of their lives: past, present, and future. They learn eventually that they are a part of each other, and that everyone is ONE. The readers are the writer, heroes are murderers, and you and I are interchangeable pronouns. It is a complexly simple and beautiful idea. However, unlike two of the author's other stories of individuals who are socially shunned, rebel teacher-types, this one stresses the submission of the individual to the whole; definitely not written for the fiercely independent individuals who may be expecting encouragement rather than calmness from the book. The reason for only a four-star rating is not indebted to any socially radical leanings, but is for a contradiction from this usually mentally agile author. Toward the end of the story, our humble narrator stumbles a bit by mentioning a higher power. Was getting past this dependence not the point, or has the grand and gaping logic of philosophy circled and returned, recycled, to a dependence on something other than ouselves? Do I hear the Pageites rattling somewhere in one of their name-induced wars? The eloquence and energy of the story, though, fade any inconsistency to a mere blur on the horizon. It is an honorable tribute to those moments of tearful and laughing love for the world, the universe, humanity, and for the ecstasy of existence.",

If you're unsure about faith, religions, philosophy...or any of that good, meaningful stuff, read this book! You'll love it! Richard Bach is a great author and it is exemplified in ONE. I thank Bach for changing my life with this book!",

                "review/text": "A second chance at love is worth fighting for as Matthew Farrell and Meredith Bancroft prove in this blissful book by Judith McNaught. This book will keep you riveted from the first! You'll experience so many emotions and such intense feelings -- love, hate, grief, joy, sadness, anger and frustration -- that when you're finished you'll feel like you've just stepped off an emotional roller coaster that left you wanting more. Remember to have a box of Kleenex handy when you begin -- you'll need them!Matthew and Meredith are some of the very best characters I've ever had the privilege to read about. They're true-to-life, three dimensional and so real that their emotions jump from the pages and weave themselves around you making the story come to life vividly. Matthew is the absolute definition of a romantic hero. Though hurt long ago by his true love he realizes he still wants her and does everything in his power to prove to her that they belong together. The way he stoically stands by his resolve to have Meredith for his own is beautiful. Though she feels betrayed by Matt, something inexplicably draws Meredith to him every time they meet. Watching Meredith burst free from the confines of her life that say she should not be with Matt is wonderful. The love between these two is explosive and oh-so-passionate! They have a deep and abiding love that even time and sordid lies could not kill.Ms. McNaught has a keen talent to make you experience her work and feel as if you've stepped into the story. Her secondary characters are just as fleshed out as her main characters and become quite real themselves. Meredith's father is a hard, bitter and selfish man who makes everyone's life miserable. I actually wanted to climb into the book and choke a fictional character!I really loved the way that Ms. McNaught showed the growth of her characters. Each character reshapes and expands throughout the book giving the reader a deeper insight into their personalities while keeping the characters genuine. By the end of the book Meredith's father even changes into someone half-way likable.I appreciated the look at Meredith's youth that gave insight into the things that shaped her as a woman and I also adored the look into the future of our couple.The plot was also outstanding -- I became engrossed in the business world that Ms. McNaught so realistically created.I can't say enough good things about this book! My first by Judith McNaught that left me wanting to rush to the nearest bookstore and snatch up all her work. Don't be daunted by the length, this book will fly by and before you know it you'll be at the end. Don't forget to search up _Perfect_ by Ms. McNaught, I hear Meredith and Matt are mentioned in that book as well. Please don't hesitate to buy this book it's one of the best I've ever read.",

                "review/text": "Toni Morrison is one of the best authors living today, and has firmly placed herself as an author that will be read years down the road. Paradise is perhaps one of her best novels, and is one of my all time favorites (I have read it three times).It does pose a difficult read for those looking for a casual book, because it is a deep and complexly interwoven book meant to stir emotions and one's mind. I am amazed at the spotlight reviews who seem confused by her style of writing and could not become involved with the characters. Morrison uses a recursive approach, one that breathes new life into each chapter (as a new character is introduced Morrison takes the time to back track to explain that person's past before joining the character with the present time of the book; Morrison's Master's Thesis was on Faulkner, who used the recursive style heavily). Although this could create confusion if you aren't aware of it, I think it makes for an altogether complete and compelling story.The Convent itself and the women that reside within are compelling, and sad, stories ready to be told, and as they unfold with their interactions with Ruby it creates a book that is absolutely amazing.This book is not for those looking for a quick easy read, or something that goes from point A to point B with no stops in between. This book will test your mind and emotions as the tale unfolds through complex chapters, leaving you with a much more fulfilling book than one that does not make you think about what you are reading. If I could give this a six star rating, I wouldn't hesitate.",

It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you groan in frustration and smile with joy- and when you get to the last page, you feel that you are parting from very dear friends.You can feel the chemistry immediately when Matt and Meredith meet. Did you ever meet someone and after that first long conversation, you feel that you've lost a long lost friend? That's how Judith makes us feel when we read of the night they met.They have been separated ten years when they meet again under rather amazing circumstances. I don't want to give any plot away, but Judith is so stinkin clever with the twist she came up with to bring them together again, and even more clever in how she keeps them together. Vague, huh?! Sorry about that but I don't want to give it away! I've never seen an author so cleverly weave such a crazy but completely believable set of events.Meredith is strong, kind, and forgiving. Her father is autocratic and domineering, belittling her no matter how much she excels but she still manages to blossom into a caring adult. Matt is tough and confident and encourages her to be more assertive. He's not only a perfect mate for her but also the perfect partner.Matt. Oh my. Where to start! He is one of my most favorite heros ever. He begins as a steel worker but builds a massive financial empire a la Trump. He's classy and smooth but a bit reserved and afraid to let many people get close to him. He's brutal with his payback when he's been wronged but will stop at nothing to win what he thinks he deserves, including getting back the woman he loves once he realizes she loves him back. Good, old fashioned ethics and a strong opinion of wrong and right. He's a knight in shining armor, whether she wants him riding to her rescue or not!",

I pull it off the shelf every few months to re-read it, and it's still as fresh and interesting as the day I bought it. Meredith and Matt are irrresistable as the lovers whom you know in your heart will make you truly believe that love makes anything possible! Circumstances hinder their relationship at every turn, but still they manage to beat the odds, and find a way to be together. And best of all.... after you read the last page of &quot;PARADISE&quot; you get to pick up with Meredith and Matt in &quot;PERFECT&quot;, and find out what happens after they walked off into the sunset. While not a sequel, &quot;Perfect&quot; is another great love story. Julie Matthison and Zachary Benedict will remind you just how great a writer Judith Mc Naught is. Two exciting stories that prove the true power of love. Sometimes,I try to decide if I have a favorite among the two, but there's no need. After all two are better than one anyway!Pick up &quot;PARADISE&quot; and &quot;PERFECT&quot;. You Just can't ask for a better way to spend your 'reading' time!",

Depending on how you answer this rather basic question, you will either love or hate this book (and the rest of Morrison's catalogue, for that matter). In other words, is reading merely another hobby for you, or is it an obsession? Morrison caters to those of us who are obsessed. We may not have all read James Joyce's Ulysses, but we plan to one day. Paradise takes a rather complex story and tells it in a complex way. If you expect to have your hand held as you saunter through this novel, go read something else. Morrison challenges her reader at every turn, forcing us to exercise our intelligence. Do you draw character maps while you read books? Perhaps you should. I diagrammed the town of Ruby to the best of my ability.The reason why so many people struggle to get through a book as difficult as Paradise (which Morrison originally planned to title \"War,\" by the way) is because they are afraid of being confused. Morrison, however, uses confusion as a means of bringing us deeper into her world. The act of reading is not so much a discovery of answers, but of more questions. Paradise is first and foremost a mystery novel: who are the nine men with guns in the first chapter? Who is the white girl? What has provoked this violence? etc etc. Every answer that Morrison gives us comes at a price: more questions. Personally, I wouldn't want to have it any other way.",

An earth goddess, yes, but nevertheless a goddess of literature and wisdom, symbolic for women the world over as One Who Has Made It, One Who Has Expressed It, One Who Teaches, etc. She is among my favorite writers. I don't love each work equally, but she's an artist, so she's entitled to irritate or bore on occasion. I notice from previous reviews that, like all artists, she touches some and leaves others cold. What I got from Paradise is her ongoing teaching that not all African American people were raised in the south; not all were directly effected by slavery; in other words, there are myriad Black stories just as there are myriad White stories. This one was particularly odd. I just got the unabridged audio version to find out what I missed in a first reading, and I'm sure there will be much. To dissatisfied reviewers: some literature is not a quick read. It takes a bit of thought, study, review, and if it's a nonlinear book you might have to re-read it in a nonlinear way, even keeping a journal of what baffles you until the pieces of the puzzle fit. In that way, Ms. Morrison is not unlike Faulkner, whose great book The Sound And the Fury has bedeviled readers for years. I feel this novel is a box of (Pandora's) secrets, or a puzzle.

Authors have done so in the past with varying degrees of success---Shakespeare, for one, was extremely succesful, but Morrison is no Shakespeare and I very much doubt that her works will endure to the extent that our old Elizabethan friend's have, if at all. The crux of the matter lies in this: Morrison, in all of her self-conscious effort, has written a tale so complex and so multifaceted that it lacks a firm center, something for the average reader to hold on to. (English teachers love this sort of book; gives them a lot to talk about.) She foregrounds too many themes and places equal emphasis on all of them so that we, the readers, are left without a definite direction of thought. I am extremely skeptical when someone claims that they have read Paradise and that they &quot;get it.&quot; One can &quot;get&quot; a theme here and there, but I have yet to meet someone who understands the novel as a whole, and I really don't believe that I ever will.

To the causal reader, the novel is almost completely indiscernible due to the very complex and very confusing plot structure and lack of an active narrative voice.So did I understand Paradise? Yes, but only after carefully picking it apart chapter by chapter in one of my English seminars. Even now, I'm not so sure that I truly comprehend all of the book's themes. And do I understand the ending? Yes, but only after wading through hours of various interviews with Morrison in which she discussed her book to great length. Most importantly, was the book worth the read? I believe so, but I devoted a lot of work to Paradise before arriving at this conclusion. Morrison's writing style is not to be taken lightly; words and themes often contain several, and sometimes seemingly infinitesimal, levels of meaning. The bottom line is that what you take away from Paradise, if anything, is up to you. If you want to walk away from this novel with any sort of satisfaction, be prepared to commit a lot though and research to the undertaking.Now, I'm not going to discuss the novel's meanings here for those who don't have the time or the will to put in the sort of work I'm talking about because doing so would far exceed the 1,000 word limit that amazon.com allows for these reviews. (I wrote 10 pages alone for my seminar on the theme of sexuality as a form of female submission and still had plenty of material left over to work with.) Whether Morrison has overextended her literary license with Paradise is debatable, but I would encourage you, the reader, to devote some effort to the reading. Who knows, you might find something worth keeping. I sure did.",

S. Eliot's famous essay on Dante; it is a classic. Esolen's introduction to the Paradise in this edition is alone worth the price of the book, and I would characterise it as a must-read for anyone interested in Dante and his Comedy.As with the previous volumes of the Comedy, in the Paradise Esolen again proves himself to be a sensitive and judicious translator, and the notes are again excellent.",

It is also, literature of the highest sort, a searing look at how everyday life can blend into madness.It is the first person account of one Hannah Luckraft, a thirty-ish year old woman whose alcoholism is either medication for an intractable depression or the cause of it. While sections of the book have been described as humorous, it is humor of the wry sort, the I-know-what-she-means sort (i.e. having been there myself,) it is nothing close to comic. It is the story of an addiction in all its technicolor black and white, its unanswerable needs and inevitable debasement.

To the newcomer - this is a very good book with which to be introduced to John Barnes. Barnes is all about extrapolating very interesting, and EXTREMELY detailed future histories. His characters' individual stories are interesting ways for him to bring his histories out.This is the third novel in the history of the 21st Century that many people are calling the &quot;Meme Wars&quot; series by default. (Not really an accurate title, since The Meme War doesn't start until 2048, and the first book in the series, Orbital Resonance, takes places a whole 25 years before the Meme Wars and is concerned with a vastly different topic.)There is also a short story, Delicate Stuff, in his anthology Apostrophes and Apocalypses. The author's blurb before this piece indicates that there will be a total of 4 novels in this series, but I suspect he could do MANY more.This book does a reasonably good job of standing alone. You can jump into it without any previous exposure to John Barnes and follow along quite well. But what it does best is provide an alternate point of view to the extremely dystopian Kaleidescope Century. In KC, we see the 20th century unfold from the point of view of 2 psychotic mercenaries. Candle shows us some events that are very closely linked to events in KC, but from the viewpoint of two very decent people who were unfortunately born at a difficult time in history. The themes are the same - who's in charge? Who has the right to be in charge? And how does one balance personal needs and desires against the good of society as a whole? But the treatment is completely different.On a grander scale, Candle illuminates (no pun intended) two very important background characters who have figured only peripherally in the earlier books - Phil and Monica. Phil and Monica wind up being among the greatest heroes of the early 21st century. Phil, under a previous name, developed the CSL curriculum which figures prominently in Candle and in Orbital Resonance. And later, Phil and Monica author the FreeCyber meme which represents earth's last stand against Resuna/One True.(to correct a previous reviewer, Phil and Monica are NOT related to anyone in Orbital Resonance.... Although Josh Quare's adopted daughter Alice IS the mother of Randy Schwartz.)My only beef with this book was the ending, which actually shocked me considerably. It wasn't a bad ending, but after reading Kaleidescope Century, I had a hard time believing that One True would suddenly go so &quot;warm-fuzzy&quot;. (As a side note, I think KC would have made more sense if Candle had been published first.)If you like this one, pick up Orbital Resonance for certain. I generally recommend Kaleidescope Century too... but be forewarned - that book is NOT for the squeamish. Although it does give a more thorough explanation of Disksters.",

                "review/text": "Out of the mainstream SF writers to emerge in the last ten or so years, John Barnes has stood out for a number of reasons, notably his consistent quality (especially given how prolific he seems), his excellent storytelling abilities and his interesting extrapolations of new ideas without getting so far &quot;out there&quot; that he loses the reader completely. In a previous book &quot;Kalidoscope Century&quot;, Barnes gave us an overview of his near future history, including a look at the &quot;Meme Wars&quot; where basically intelligent computer programs used people as pawns to take over the planet (that's oversimpifying by a bit, actually). In this novel Barnes takes us back to just after that time, where hunter Currie Curran lives with his wife in a world where the meme &quot;One True&quot; controls everyone through its program Resuna, adjusting thoughts and memories and emotions in order to make everyone more effective and happy. Currie used to hunt &quot;cowboys&quot;, people who hadn't been &quot;turned&quot; by One True and lived independent lives on the edge of society. There's one still left called Lobo and Currie goes out to hunt him one last time. It doesn't go well and Currie ends up Lobo's prisoner with his link to One True missing and his copy of Resuna disconnected. Here the story actually begins as Barnes tries to use this as a backdrop to explore the meaning of individuality and what it means in a wrecked society that needs repairing, as well as showcasing his imagination. The problem mostly lies with the execution. After the initial rather thrilling sequence of Currie remembering the first hunt against Lobo and then going out and getting the guy again, the book sort of loses all momentum and stops dead while the two fellows swap stories about what they were doing during the Meme Wars. While Barnes can craft a good tale, these tales on the whole come off as rather static and it's hard to get any kind of suspense when you have two grown men drinking wine and sharing a bath in the name of male bonding. Some action starts to get generated towards the end but the ending itself pretty much comes out of nowhere and seems way too warm and cuddly as well as far too forgiving of a lot of things that Barnes himself brought up. All in all, somewhat disappointing given the premise, Barnes really doesn't make it as interesting as he could (as he's proved in the past) and that makes the book frustratingly uneven. Fans will probably enjoy it to some extent, since it's not bad, just average, but newcomers would be wiser to start with some of his earlier novels and work down from there.",

However, he gets trapped by his prey and there is never an explanation for how that happened. I really wanted to know how he was outsmarted.The story basically is over at this time and the rest of the book is a lengthy character history of the two men.

Orbital Resonance was a Coming of Age story, Kaleidoscope Century was an Anti-Hero Cautionary story. What does that make Candle?Candle is a story about personal control, internal and external, and what it really means to be human in relation to whether a person actually controls their own destiny, or has their destiny controlled by others. These are deep subjects, and this novel is neither as fast paced as Kaleidoscope Century nor as sympathetic as Orbital Resonance. Instead it tries to point out that a person is not really a person unless they are themselves free of external control. This is more and more important in the real world as various elements of society vie to control the minds of everyone they can in any way they can.The book gets deeply into the minds of the central character and to some degree his opponent as well. It also showcases some of the effects of growing old out of a profession and a lifetime of activities based on youth and vigor.For fans of the first two books, a variety of questions are resolved, but even larger ones are raised. I can't reveal more without revealing things that are left to the end of the novel, but it raises questions based on things the other books have speculated will happen in the future.Overall, I felt the book was excellent, but as I said, also quite different.",

After all, the setup is not necessarily compelling: two guys hiding out in the snow, trying not to call attention to themselves. It doesn't make for an action-packed plot.Luckily, quite a lot of the book is given over to the two main characters telling their life stories, filling in some of the history of the Meme Wars. Most of the philosophical exposition happens inside this panoramic and engaging context, so it works better than the high school debate-style discussion I feared and expected.Once again, John Barnes has managed to make reading about abstract, high minded concepts be fun.",

This time the suspense comes from those who wish to gain something from this Incan site and a legend of \"Satan's Blood\"; a near magical substance that holds a key to an age-old secret plan. Like the first book, there was some imbalance in eco systems where there seemed to be more predators than the food supply could allow but this time it is less important to the plot and therefore easier to overlook.Both EXCAVATION and SUBTERRANEAN are better than AMAZONIA (his fourth book) with the stories being more complete.

I've got to admit that once I finally got into the story, this was a hard book to put down.I'm not big on giving too much of the plot line away in these reviews because I hate it when somebody does that. So, suffice it to say, Rollins does a nice job keeping two plots lines going and tying them together at the end of the book. There's a lot of action in the last 300 pages and it's easy to pick out the &quot;bad&quot; guys in this book - a group who's usually not thought of as being &quot;bad&quot; guys, I might add!

As far as I can tell either his talent has greatly increased or an editor finally decided to reign in his ideas and give them direction because SOMETHING has happened in between novel 1 and novel 2--something very good.I found myself drawn into this tale virtually from page 1 and it honestly began to get better, gradually at first, and then like a steamroller with no brakes it takes off and refuses to slow down. I have to say, that the thought of being caught in an archaelogical dig with THOUSANDS of albino tarantulas massing to use YOU for an evening snack was enough to bring the hair on my neck to attention. More detailed, MUCH more complex, 'Excavation' is a great Hollywood movie in-waiting in my opinion. Kinda like 'X-Files' meets 'Indiana Jones'. A great combination and overall, a VERY fun and exciting novel, and when all is said and done, a TREMENDOUS improvement over 'Subterranean'.",

I picked it due to an intriguing description and cover, and hoped to be in for some good, old-fashioned adventuring. What I ended up with was a book so poorly written as to be unignorable... you can't even just not-think your way through this one, it forces its badness into your skull with a small golden dagger. I will give the author what credit I can: he would make an excellent screenwriter. This book can't shake it's inherent movieness, it cries out for a film version. The dialogue is snappy and the visuals would be stunning on-screen, and I get the distinct impression it was written with just that in mind. Its plot is just coherent enough to make an action/adventure movie, the sort where you don't think too hard, you just relax and watch. That, however, does not play well in book form. When read, the characters (all but one) are painfully two-dimensional stereotypes and the plot is so full of holes, omissions, contradictions and bizarre leaps of logic that it simply falls apart, leaving the reader clutching his or her head in pain and wondering why. The author's vocabulary is good and his prose is better than some, but the story and characters are simply not very good. I can imagine the characters reciting their lines with quiet embarassment written on their faces... And the part of the book where our heroine feigns seduction on a novice monk in order to get information was so reprehensible that it made me want to vomit. It's best when writing, I think, not to make the reader feel as though he's accidentally put his hand in something unspeakably horrible and squishy. I can't help but think that scene speaks volumes about the author. The whole scene felt like the literary equivalent of two first cousins getting married... you're disgusted, and at the same time, embarassed for them.There are positives I should say... the premise is undeniably creative, and seems to be quite well-researched. I tried to like it, I really did, but by the end it seemed clear that the book simply suffered from a lack of real care. Rarely was any emotion conveyed, as the characters and situations were so cliched that you didn't really have to *read* it to know what was going to happen... There was no apparent message or theme, it was just... there. The author shows potential as far as concepts are concerned, but everything else was just unrealised.",

Poorly characterized and predictably plotted, it reads like an \"ABC After School Special\" version of an Indian Jones movie.Oddly, Rex Stout wrote this book (or something almost exactly like it) about 80 years ago and called it \"Under The Andes.\" It's available online in its entirety if you don't believe me.There are dozens of authors who do this thing better: Philip Jose Farmer, Jeff Long (\"The Descent\"), Talbot Mundy, H. Rider Haggard-- heck, read Lovecraft's \"At The Mountains of Madness\" for a ten-times-better look at an expedition seeking a lost civilization.But skip this-- even if Rollins get a few things right in the first few hundred pages, actually spurring you to seek answers to several interesting plot developments, he throws it all away in the last few hundred with cliched writing and a surpriseless denouement.

How can such a tiny book create such havoc in my brain? I now understand the (ir)rationale for the drill bits.Hakim Bey writes in a beautifully poetic style. The book begins with a series of essays on chaos, art, sorcery, etc. Examples of what he calls poetic terrorism: Break into someone's home and leave a bizzare object behind, kidnap someone and make them happy, put up a commemorative plaque where you've had memorable orgasm, etc. Hillarious! If ever you're feeling down just pick a page at random and I promise you'll never find better medecine.The final portion of the book consists of a long essay entitled The Temporary Autonomous Zone. A T.A.Z. is a virtual/physical space beyond the reach of the Spectacle where no rules exist. It is temporary and constantly changing because only this way can it avoid absorbtion by the Beast/Empire/Spectacle/Choronzon, whatever you choose to call it. Ultimately though, any attempt to describe what the T.A.Z. &quot;is&quot; becomes a lie, like trying to define God or Tao.Another great thing about the book is that it is small enough to carry in your pocket. I have it with me everywhere I go, and I always keep a backup copy at home in case I loose it or give it away.Anyway, if you value your life and (in)sanity forget this garbage review you just read and buy/steal your own copy of T.A.Z.",

But slowly it has been bubbling to the surface, often in unexpected places. The novel and film Fight Club, surely shows an affection for poetic terrorism, an idea rooted in Bey's ontological anarchism and closely related to the situationist tactic of detornement. T.A.Z. is not the property of any philosophy but chaos and elegant disorder. Sure, there are aspects of anarchism, chaos thinking, situationist leanings, but that is just a symptom of the spectacle and is such precisely because of it. These essays all point to a way out of this spectacular society, but the first step comes with the mere recognition of it. This is harder than it sounds, or perhaps easier. TV and the media are always easy components to recognize, the real challenge is to recognize how the spectacle, i.e., the prefabricated, artificial, consumerist milieu penetrates, influences and shapes even our most intimate thoughts--which we often mistake for our own desires, wants and needs. In T.A.Z. Bey offers suggestions on how we can extricate ourselves from this structure and start creating our own temporary autonomous zones, within this system of economic, social and cultural oppression. Immediatism, Poetic Terrorism, and the embrace of Chaos are just a few of the strategies that he advises, all of which presuppose a new dialectic with reality.This is only an outline, a mere review, I leave discerning and interpreting the details to you...Get this book today (also available in spoken word from axiom records).",

Personally i reckon that we are in the midst of a conspiracy, yes...but most likely an unconscious one--the aggregate of fear & complacency & ignorance & such things, that is, resulting insidiously in the effects of a sort of conspiracy. What sort of result, for example, would one really expect from blowing up a transmission tower? A sudden enlightenment of the populace? No: most people would likely become even more reactionary when faced with causes for alarm.Essentially this book, in spite of its claims to the contrary, seems to me a variety of art movement and not the \"ultimate\" anything, but as with anything so incendiary and beautiful its value can still hardly be overestimated. Who can resist Poetic Terrorism or Bey's felicity with language (eg. Chaote art)? The language and imagery are colourful and bursting full. Imagine a feast laid out on a table with barely enough room for the feasters' plates--and certainly not enough for their elbows--and everyone seated around it wearing purple plumage or velvet saris or nothing at all & laughing with food in their mouths.I'll take what i need and leave the rest, as it goes. Implicit in most of the writing is criticism of those who would reject any part of the \"freedom\" described, but who's afraid of Hakim Bey? I'm glad he wrote even if i won't be taking all of what he wrote to heart.",

It's like discovering Marge Piercy at the tender, malleable age of 12, or finding Clarissa Pinkola Estes' book, worn and well-loved, after a ten-year marriage filled with abuse. Except, TAZ doesn't require you to be at any particular phase of your life to change it. It just does. Sometimes, it's not immediate. Sometimes it sits quietly in the back of your mind, bubbling up curt replies to oppressive corporate and societal forces that occasionally - tragically infrequently, to begin with - with issue forth from your mouth and cause bank tellers to go pale with shock.Temporary Autonomous Zones are nets of co-conspirators, ready to take the mass of over-bearing government and the thin veneer of so-called civilization down, not through bloody revolution, but rather through obsolescence. If we do not respect the right to control us, if we have our own power back to do our own work, only then are we our own people. And moreover, in &quot;Ontological Anarchism&quot;, we find the suggestion that we do not have to define ourselves by ANYTHING other than what WE feel we are. We are &quot;supposed&quot; to be productive, civilized, friendly, codependent, well-dressed, well-paid, well-fed and easily coddled. But humans are NOT that - we are animals, base creatures of a triple nature, as gods are, as goddesses are.

The beauty of this tiny molotov cocktail is it's insistence that personal rebellion, rather than superficial political activism, is the real way to freedom, a conviction I've held firmly for a good deal of my life. Only through a reordering and a total recreation of the individual's perceptions can he or she be truly free, and even then the mental discipline necessary for true liberation must be maintained with the greatest vehemence.

This is pehaps the very worst book I have ever forced myself to finish cover-to-cover. The bloated detailing made me think that I was actually rading the production notes on a screenplay. The trademarked brand name-dropping became so trite halfway through the book that I looked up it here to be sure I wasn't just irrational. I found several reviewers remarking on the same. One quipped that the book was in desperate need of an editor & another talked of the 60 page story fluffed out to 500. It's all true. What's even worse is the \"for pay\" endorsement by Robert Parker. I assume this because the quote attributed to him is pure B.S. It is neither \"compelling\", \"taut\" nor \"wonderfully told\".

Self-diagnostic questions and simple examples combine to give you a good sense of what you need to work on.The author provides a number of definitions of charisma (including the one in the title of this review), and seems to focus on &quot;the ability to influence others positively by connecting with them physically, emotionally, and intellectually.&quot;Daniel Goleman has written a great deal about emotional intelligence (see his books, Emotional Intelligence and Working with Emotional Intelligence), and has noted that many people lack skill in this area. For those who have little of this capability, Charisma will provide a useful toolkit for assessing and adapting successfully in social situations.The book is organized around a few key ideas: making a good first impression, making a good impression when you speak, being an effective listener, becoming more persuasive, using physical surroundings to your advantage, maximizing adaptability to the situation, and expanding your vision and ideas. These are all good areas to focus on, and few will find that they are equally strong in each one. Once you find your weaker points, the author provides you will simple, effective suggestions for improvement.He sums up all his thinking in a Platinum Rule: Do unto others as they would like done unto them.If you want more advanced help in this area, you will find Goleman, Cialdini (Influence), and books on neuro-linguistic programming to be helpful.The main point is that we should all work on our social effectiveness and comfort. All of us know more than any one of us, and we can accomplish much more together. Enjoy this stallbusting book and have more joy in your life!",

He then offers a weak thesis that charisma is related to communication then proceeds to stuff the rest of the book with what is obviously old material on the subject of communication occasionally tying it to charisma.

I've sat through seminars, workshops, speeches, and classes hoping to pick up one more little gem of an idea to improve my effectiveness.In Charisma, Tony Alessandra has pulled all of that knowledge together in one place. After many years in business, and a whole lot of learning about how to be successful in sales, management, and life, I recognized quite a bit of the contents of this volume. I really enjoyed the refresher and reinforcement . . . and I picked up some new advice that I'd missed along the way.The book starts, appropriately with an introduction to Charisma: &quot;the ability to positively influence others by connecting with them physically, emotionally, and intellectually.&quot; From the introductory chapters, Alessandra takes us on a journey through seven fully-loaded chapters spilling over with the secrets of how to fashion and hone that influencing ability.To enable you to see the framework of this tool kit, I'll list the chapters. Sending Out Your Best Silent Message, Speaking with Authority, Listening Attentively, Becoming More Persuasive, Using Space and Time to Your Advantage, Maximizing Your Adaptability, and Expanding Your Vision and Ideas. As a reader, you'll find yourself asking your author-mentor how he learned all this stuff! Wow! Your respect and admiration will grow, followed by appreciation as you put the many principles to work and start seeing results.This book should be required reading for every salesperson, every high school senior, every young person starting out on a career. People who have been around for a while, but who have not yet achieved the success they desire, will also benefit greatly from this guidebook. The continual flow of advice and wisdom is interrupted by a self-test in every chapter. You'll be able to see yourself grow page by page.Hint to make this a better world: Parents, buy this book for your kids.PS: Alessandra is also author of The Platinum Rule. Read that one next!",

During this time, he slips into drugs and petty crime. Rejected by his parents, out of school and in trouble with the police, he claims for himself a new identity as a permanent outsider; he gets a crossed-bones tattoo on his arm, and takes the name \"Bone.\" He finds dangerous refuge with a group of biker-thieves, and then hides in the boarded-up summer house of a professor and his wife. He finally settles in an abandoned schoolbus with Rose, a child he rescues from a fast-talking pedophile. There Bone meets I-Man, an exiled Rastafarian, and together they begin a second adventure that takes the reader from Middle America to the ganja-growing mountains of Jamaica. It is an amazing journey of self-discovery through a world of magic, violence, betrayal and redemption.",

He read it in three days and loved it. I quickly finished the book I had chosen (A STAR CALLED HENRY) and picked up his copy of RULE. I had never read Banks, except for a few short stories here and there, but now I am a complete convert (so much so, in fact, that I'm reading CLOUDSPLITTER now, which makes RULE seem like an even better book than i first thought). i noticed that one reviewer wrote that Banks had gotten the voice of the narrator all wrong. That reader apparently does not spend the majority of his waking hours with teenagers. I do. And let me say that the narration is dead on in every respect. So often critics claim to have discovered the next CATCHER IN THE RYE or the heir to HUCKLEBERRY FINN and never before have I agreed until now. RULE OF THE BONE is a beautiful novel with something real at stake, perhaps something more real than Holden Caufield's three-day ramble (and certainly more engaging). Bone's journey to himself (his &quot;I-self&quot;) is visceral and funny and sad and moving. I plan to teach it next year in my modern novel course.",

It is probably good escapism for responsible teens who fantasize about abandoning school work and simply drifting, so long at they don't sink themselves into escape, fly from reality and start using drugs. Though a low quality of life is portrayed in this book, the quality of the writing is high.On another level, this is an interesting look at the devastation which irresponsible parents can wreak upon a child, people who never had any business having kids in the first place. To a thinking individual, the vagabond life that young Bone is leading is, initially, absolutely disgusting. His values are non-existent, his behavior atrocious -- and then some facts emerge which make you understand, which make you feel genuinely sorry for the kid.The question is, did Bone grow up, mature and move on in his life? Or did he simply become a drug-wasted drifter for the rest of his days?",

My wife says he's smug, I say he's a realist. However, compared to other Banks novels, Bone is a joyride. Plenty or lighter moments and a protagonist who's spunk makes him worth cheering for if not quasi-likeable. While not a fast read, it's quite literal and moves along as quickly as the locales of the story change. Again, Banks explores familial relationships and how they're affected by societal conditions. Perhaps the only thing keeping this book from getting five stars from me is the knowledge that Continental Drift and the Sweet Hereafter exist. Every time I read a Banks book, besides Cloudsplitter, I wonder why he isn't a more popular writer with the status quo. He's a great writer and this is a good book.",

In many matters, this book will capture anyones attention right from the start. It is true that Russell Banks doesn't show great punctuation throughout the book, but if you really understand a teenager you would know that this is truly how a teen speaks and writes. As a teenager growing up I was faced with the temptation of smoking out because of my peers and Banks was only letting the world know a little more on how nowadays the pressure of dealing with drugs is a lot greater and in our everyday life. Most can say that this book will catch anyones attention right from the start because what we see and hear today is the basic reality that Banks created in his book. I would recommend any one mostly guys to read this book. I know some people are like me that won't be caught with a book but trust me you'll enjoy this one. You'll enjoy it greatly because it is very lucid and for parents who want to understand the mind of a troubled teen or any teen you should definitely read this book.

The main character and some other characters, will go through situations that most adults have never and will never go through in their lifetime. The honesty of the writing will certainly leave some people with their mouth wide open in a state of amazement and shock. I have read Rule of the Bone, and on a scale of 1-10 I, personally give it a 6. I agree that for such a popular book it is lower then expected but once you read the book and see my reasons you might agree with me. I enjoyed the book in the beginning because it was as if the book was exciting and fun to read. The sense of excitement kept me turning the pages therefor it wasn't hard to get into the book. Although I would have preferred a dull beginning (in this case) and an intense middle and ending but, unfortunately it was the opposite. As you will read the first few pages you will see that you might have to go back and read something over. This is due to the long sentences which are used throughout the whole book. These long sentences provide the reader with some difficulty and takes away from the pleasure of reading. The books language and vocabulary contains slang and some detailed scenes that might disturb and even disgust the reader. If all of these will prove as a problem, don't stop reading the book, because in the end it doesn't matter how good of a book it was. Instead, go back and read the page again, if slang is a problem read on and try to figure out what is being said. I have had to read this book because it was mandatory for my Social Issues class. And although I had choices of reading other books, the reason I chose this particular book was the title. It sounded exciting and in a teens eyes dangerous. The other reason was the first paragraph, and once you read it you'll know what I mean. I recommend this book to males in particular due to the strong violence and content. If you like &quot;intricate&quot; writing this might be the book for you, and if adventure is what you like this will top anything else you have read. &quot;I opened up the drawer, and inside there was a bag with 20 neatly rolled up joints, a marvelous find.&quot; This quote illustrates some of the content which is talked about throughout. This scene takes place in a house which he and a companion broke into; this is the sense of adventure that I was talking about. Although the book is mundane for chapters and chapters until a new adventure begins you wont be too disappointed.",

Although slow, these opportunities and open doors do arrive. With the help of a Rastafarian guardian angel, who helps him find the way. Chappie learns about life, love, family and friends the hard way but with many memories and experiences that will be with him for the rest of his life.Rule Of The Bone by Russell Banks is a page-turner. With out hesitation this book gets a 10 in my opinion. Once you start you will not want to put it down. There is no warm up chapter; you're addicted from the first page. The teenage vernacular was crafted to perfection, making it easy to read. Especially the vocabulary. The story is complex. It invokes all new ideas, thoughts, and feelings into your head.You might have a very difficult time reading this book if you can't relate to teenage behavior or can't deal with it. Critical and judgmental people might also have a hard time with it because of the unconventional journey of the lead character. This book can easily be called a modern day Catcher In The Rye. It's bound to be a classicI would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story about life and for people who are trying to figure out who they are inside. This book gives you a perfect look at how one boy finds himself. Rule Of The Bone is fun for all ages from adolescents to people with Alzheimer's as long as they have an open mind.&quot; It's weird but as long as I didn't look at her and watched the guy with her instead, her uncle or whatever, I didn't flip out, all I was into was bumming a smoke from the guy.

As you can see there are no big words you don't know the meaning of and there are not any complicated sentences. In fact, it's quite the opposite. The sentences sound as though an actual teen was talking to you and the sentences have no structure. They are all &quot;run on&quot; sentences.

        "description": "The 50th anniversary edition of the notorious, radical survival guide to living free as a revolutionary from one of the greatest activists of the 20th century--now with a new foreword. In 1970, infamous activist Abbie Hoffman sat in Cook County jail, awaiting what would become known as the Trial of the Chicago Seven. Hoffman and six conspirators were prosecuted by the US government for their part in anti-Vietnam War and counterculture protests outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention. It was in jail that Hoffman would begin to write Steal This Book. Labelled by publishers as a book that would \"end free speech\" and causing scandals with its advice on how to get free food, housing, transportation, medical care, and more, as well as how to run a guerrilla movement, Steal This Book is a revolutionary's manual to \"survival in the prison that is Amerika.\" Hoffman criss-crossed the country, ferreting out alternative ways of getting along in America--some illegal, and all radical--using his own decades of experience in living and fighting underground. Split into three sections to Survive!, Fight!, and Liberate!, Steal This Book captures the spirit of those years, describing actions and techniques that were already in use in all 50 states and sharing them with the masses. This anniversary edition will give you a window into the movements of the sixties and seventies. While many of the holes in the system which Hoffman exposes have since been plugged up, the spirit of revolution, the dedicated to undermining injustice, and the earnestness of activism remain--in this book and in activism today.",

                "review/text": "Steal This Book is truly a clever and apropos title. It's also as far as quality in the book goes. Other than for the novelty, the book isn't worth the time it takes to read it. Poorly written and full of grammatical errors, it tries one's patience while its anarchistic ravings raise blood pressure. The book is rife with ignorance, teenage angst, and--especially--hypocrisy. He rages against war, but teaches knife fighting, weaponry, and bomb-making. He rails against the injustices of the &quot;Amerikan&quot; legal system, yet advises how to exert one's rights and seek protection under the very system he aims to bring down. While complaining that no publishing company would buy his book, he blasts capitalism as a pig establishment, yet offers no viable alternatives other than to steal from those who have. Even taken in the context of the times, that of the early 1970s with anti-war sentiment at its peak, the book is hard to stomach. Hoffman gives the impression that he loves revolution for the sake of revolution, not for any well-defined philosophy based on principle, virtue, religion, or political belief. Abbie Hoffman comes off as the product of a privileged society, a child of advantage, a spoiled rich kid with too much time on his hands, a kid who never experienced real hunger, hard work, or the joys of accomplishment and reward. This is the rant of a naughty boy. He calls on the &quot;Robin Hoods of Santa Barbara Forest to steal from the robber barons who own the castles of capitalism,&quot; but warns that &quot;To steal from a brother or sister is evil. To not steal from the institutions that are the pillars of the Pig Empire is equally immoral.&quot; Unfortunately, he fails to offer advice on distinguishing between brothers and pigs. Consider these quote gems: &quot;Make war on the sterile machines of corporate death and the robots that guard them.&quot; &quot;It's so easy to get on Welfare that anyone who is broke and doesn't have a regular relief check coming in is nothing but a goddamn lazy bum!&quot; &quot;Power to all the dirty fighters!&quot; On knife fighting against the police he says, &quot;Remember that today's pig is tomorrow's bacon; it's good to know a few handy slicing tips.&quot; If you want to read it, don't steal it; don't reward those who write and publish such garbage. Borrow it, if you must. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead.",

Regrettably, it is VERY difficult to follow the late and great Abbie's advice and \"steal this book\" from Amazon. Nonetheless, if you read the book when it first came out, it is worth a reread. If you have not read it, I would recommend reading it for a wide variety of reasons. It gives a good historical perspective of the time, and aside from the outdated technology; much of the philosophical content is still quite valid.And, of course, if you are planning to attend a riot at the WTO, etc., you can get some great advice on protecting your lungs from tear gas and your brain from batons. Not all of the advice is outdated. Some of the &#8220;projects&#8221; are still interesting and informative.For just a small price, I think you can forgo stealing it and buy it here at Amazon.Peace!",

But ultimately, the book is a contradiction in direction and a collection of anti-American hyperbole with ways to become a worse person and ultimately make society a lesser place to live.Now, the above statement is not a commentary for those who believe this way. There are times when I still feel anger at the actions of the corporate world and the government alike. But I don't promote peace while preaching ways to kill another person with a knife, like Hoffman does.I strongly agree with one reviewer who says that, \"The book is rife with ignorance, teenage angst, and--especially--hypocrisy.\" What you have here is a book which really rallies against nothing but a generic idea which can be summed up with the expression, \"Things I don't like.\" By attempting to rally the American youth by saying we are all brothers and sisters, he holds on to this thin veil of togetherness while teaching you ways to blow things up.Most annoying is Hoffman's continued insistence on using the expressions \"Pig Empire\" and \"Amerika\" as if these acts of defiance justify his position. All they do is paint himself in the corner of the teen angst the above reader mentioned.Again, I'm not supporting business and government. But this approaches presented in this book are mindless and equally oppressive. Essentially, he wants the world to fall into anarchy where you just take, by force if necessary, whatever you want.I find the book an interesting study on the culture of the times. Not so much because of what's in it, but because of the fact that you can read this book with the knowledge that it was something that was marvelled at from the time period. Other than that, there are a lot of other books that are worth the time above and beyond this one.",

The frequent advocacy of violence as a tool to make change appears to be more in line with the far right.There are some useful critiques of power relationships here, but the book suffers from very outdated information. What was cutting edge for activists in my parent's generation now seems like it should be a historical footnote in a Smithsonian exhibit on political protest in the 1960's.Individuals who are looking for an in-depth portrait of Hoffman should consider renting/purchasing 'Steal This Movie'.",

People like MLK and brother Malik Al Hajji Shabazz (Malcolm X)did not want freedom FROM responsibility for themselves and their people; they wanted freedom TO be sucessful and responsible. The people he claimed to understand so also did not at the time get welfare or live in poverty because they enjoyed it; it was for survival and because they had to. They also wanted the poverty to be as temporary a situation as possible. They also did not glamourize drug use or dealing, think living in filth was virtuous, have any use for \"free love\" that actually was costly and had no real love, and indeed resented the yippies and hippies for bringing in a drug culture and vandalization to the ghetto that we still today have to rise above.

        "description": "In this haunting and riveting firsthand account, a survivor of Jim Jones's Peoples Temple opens up the shadowy world of cults and shows how anyone can fall under their spell. A high-level member of Jim Jones's Peoples Temple for seven years, Deborah Layton escaped his infamous commune in the Guyanese jungle, leaving behind her mother, her older brother, and many friends. She returned to the United States with warnings of impending disaster, but her pleas for help fell on skeptical ears, and shortly thereafter, in November 1978, the Jonestown massacre shocked the world. Seductive Poison is both an unflinching historical document and a suspenseful story of intrigue, power, and murder.",

                "review/text": "Writing a review of Deborah Layton's &quot;Seductive Poison&quot; is not easy for me, because I can't think of any words that will be superlative enough to do justice to this book and to compliment the author on being so courageous and for so eloquently sharing intimate details of her experience of life in and her escape from a destructive cult.I didn't know *anything* about cults or anything about Jonestown for that matter (I was not only too young at the time these events took place but also literally on the other side of the world) till a few weeks ago when I feared that someone who I loved and still love dearly may be in a cultic group. A search on Amazon led me to Deborah Layton's book and reading Seductive Poison combined with the events happening concurrently in my life can only be described as a life-changing experience.Deborah Layton's account of life in and her escape from Jonestown is the most moving of any personal accounts I have ever read and I will admit that there were parts of the book that had me in tears... which says a lot. When I first read this book I was convinced that the book is just that... it's *a story which happened to someone else* and things like this don't happen today...until I started experiencing the effect of a mind-control group first hand -- happening to someone very close to me. If you ever do the mistake of thinking that this cannot happen to you... be sure to catch yourself, because 23 years later, after Jonestown, after Waco, after Heaven's Gate and numerous others... it's the same mind-control techniques and the same deceit and debauchery that is just as much prevalent today as it was then and potentially even more refined than it used to be.Seductive Poison helped me understand what a cult is and made me realize that I cannot try and deal with the situation I was faced with using the rules I knew so far. The rationalism and logic that you would expect to always be present and help a person make their own informed decisions and judgments are sometimes suspended - and always suspended when an individual is under a situation of being under the control of a destructive mind-control group or even an the influence of an individual. I never realized that until I read Deborah Layton's experience.Seductive Poison should be required reading in high-schools / colleges, just so more people are aware of the dangers lurking about them. I have personally bought over a dozen copies of this book to hand out to friends and family (Amazon must really love me by now!) and I don't think I'm done handing it out to people yet, because in my opinion, this book is a vaccine for the human mind and it is critical for *any* person living in today's society - in any country, in any environment - to develop some level of immunity which allows them to recognize a destructive situation before they get sucked in too deep.I'll end with a quote from an email I sent shortly after reading Seductive Poison and co-relating events in my life: \"The mind is a very fragile thing, and I strongly believe that no stimulus and no words can go by without affecting a person -- I don't claim to know more or less about what is true or not, but I do believe in being pragmatic and using ones own judgment and critical thinking to set the boundaries for our actions.\"And last but not least, to Deborah Layton - thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing your experience with all of us and thank you for being the amazing person I know you are.",

She was only a young woman when she first got in touch with Jim Jones's temple and got involved deeply with it.The book is written in a way that the reader can follow each step of a member joining the cult, so we can track every single decision made and question it. It is interesting to note, following her narrative, that there seemed to be no highly unreasonable decisions, just a sequence of commitments that drove the temple members deeper and deeper into the psychological orbit of the reverend. From San Francisco to international banking transactions to hide Jim's money, to obsessively worrying about an imminent governemtn attack, the reader follows people who would otherwise be reasonable and kind doing outrageously aggressive and violent actions, even including physical torture.There is also, unexpectedly, a high suspense section in the end, when Deborah escapes the compound in Guyana to try to come back to the US. Though I suppose she is a first time writer, she was quite capable of transmitting the gut wrenching circumstances of her escape.This is an eye opening book, one that you will find yourself thinking about for at least a couple of months after reading it.",

The explanation for this behavior is apparently that the author was very innocent and felt unloved by her family. The author also describes amazing scenes of people vomiting up cancers and other dramatic healings by Jones but never explains what she thinks is really going on here. References are made to several influential politicians of that time but no explanation for their involvement with such a bizarre group.

Jim Jones was able to convince many a politician he was legitimate. How else could he have become the Director of the Human Rights Commission? Lord knows none of us would have been able to tell THEN what we know perfectly well NOW with 20/20 hindsight. I think Deborah has given a part of her soul to explain what happened. And the least folks like me who are blissfully ignorant and often arrogantly opinionated can do is take a second look at something that still desperately needs to be understood.

This book was a real eye opener for me.Seductive Poison is heart-breakingly honest and tells a story so few people actually know. I had heard about &quot;what happened&quot; and then just dismissed the members as a bunch of uneducated lower class people. I now know I was dead wrong. I can see where this could have happened to someone like me had I been in California during the 60's. The country was in turmoil over the war in Vietnam, the civil rights movement, the Black Panthers, free speech and People's Temple fit right in by pooling from the disenchanted, disinfranchised &amp; young hopeful college kids who wanted to make a difference. I know that feeling even now in my own search for meaning and purpose. In so many religions we are taught to think of others, help them, get involved and that is what the members of Jone's group believed they were doing. To think so many well intentioned people were gradually deceived then islolated and murdered in a far off country is heartbreaking.I recommend this book highly!

                "review/text": "During my last battle with procrastination, lethargy and anger at not making headway upon my goals, I purchased Peter McWilliams book \"Do It!\". I had reached a point where I was stagnant, and hoped that this book might do like the title suggest and get me off my butt. The book looks huge, clocking in at over 500 pages, but don't let that fool you. It is barely half of that because there must be 300 quotes blocked out throughout the text. I read the introduction and became interested in what McWilliams had to say.McWilliams breaks the book up into six larger sections full of small chapters. He tackles his topic quickly and abundantly. The book begins by explaining the reasons why we procrastinate, working through finding a goal, achieving that goal, and what to do after the goal has been achieved. The most helpful section to me was the first as he explains the reasons why many of us do not achieve our goals. His belief is that going against our comfort zone is the hardest thing to do, and it is this comfort zone that prefers us to procrastinate.I think that the book is above average in motivating you. McWilliams has a way of writing that excites you to the point where you think you can do what you need to accomplish your goals (even if finding a goal is your goal). He provides tips to help you achieve your goal, like needing to work on your goal two hours a day. He uses a handful of exercises to help you identify your goal, but otherwise there is not much interaction for the reader. He also provides a lot of quotes. Some may find quotes motivational. I found them entertaining. There are more quotes than just those that appear in boxes. McWilliams tends to write by using a quote, and then interpreting it and expanding on it to get his point across. So, you need to like quotes before reading this book.I feel like I got something out of this book. It's not the best motivational book, as it didn't make me dive into achieving my goal, but it did get me to think about my goal and what I need to do about it. It also gave me ways to combat the comfort zone. Overall, I think if you have strayed slightly from your goal this book will help you get back on track, or if you are looking for a goal to pursue it may help you identify one.",

                "review/text": "I purchased Do It! expecting it to help me get motivated and overcome procrastination. I'm writing this review, not necessarily to be critical, but to inform prospective readers of the book's high content of New Age thinking. I point this out simply because nothing in the book title or description gives any clue as to the authors religious/spiritual point of reference.The reader is guided into such practices as the consultation with an inner \"Master Teacher\" (as part of a greater inner \"Sanctuary\") and meditative chant (complete with a recommended list of tones for energy, healing, etc). It stops short of stating outright the New Age belief that we are all gods, but it certainly drops hints (i.e. tithing your money is saying thank you to YOURSELF for your abundance). The authors carefully tip-toe around the discussion of any belief in a creator, as if your creator isn't to have any say in what your purpose is or what your highest dreams should be....huh? Moral standards are subject to being completely discarded if they are deemed counter-productive to achieving your \"Big Dream\". Nowhere in the discussion of guilt is it even hinted that you might need to seek reconciliation with God or others, guilt is portrayed merely an energy to be used for escaping your \"comfort zone\". The authors refer you to Matthew, chapter 7 as a biblical stamp of approval on their ideas, yet they completely ignore the message of the rest of the Book.The pity of it all is that in between all the aformentioned psychobabble is some genuine wisdom, motivation, and downright good ideas, written in a humorous, easy to read style that makes the book hard to put down. I truly believe the book could have been as much or more effective without all the pushing of religious beliefs. If you're into eastern mysticism or New Age thinking you may find this a wonderful book. I give the 3 star rating arbitrarily because I could not in good concience apply many of the practices prescribed by the author, but again, readers of another mindset may find the book extremely useful and motivating.",

                "review/text": "I have read a lot of self-help books, but this is the first one that actually helped.First off, I would say DO THE EXCERCISES!!! There aren't many of them, they are simple -- though not easy. They force you to focus, to confront yourself and your assumptions about your life.The main thing I took away from this book was a more realistic outlook. The world does not owe you a thing. As Mark Twain said, &quot;The world doesn't owe you anything; it was here first.&quot; I think a lot of people are like me -- it's not that we don't have any dreams -- it's that we have too many. this leads to a sense of not having enough time. It's like being in the perfect library -- there are so many books you want to read, you have a hard time decding which one to start with. Our dreams are often like that. What is needed is a plan. What do you really want to read. Not, I want to read Moby Dick, and then Madame Bovary... the trick, when confronted with too many choices, is to find a more overarching dream -- I want to have read the best American Novels of the 19th Century. Then, as sad as it may make you feel, you drop Madame Bovary. BUT that doen't mean you cvan't come back later.The trick is to START! Often you will find that when you pursue one dream, other dreams you had take care of themselves in the process.Buy this book. It's a quick read -- even with the excercises, and you will come away with a sense that it really is never too late, and that with work, your dreams are possible.",

I have read a disgusting amount of self-help books in the area of motivation and realising and making dreams come true. And here I am, in the process, but perhaps taking more time to make them come true than is really necessary.This is the be all and end all of motivation books. The research that has gone into this piece, the endless and inpsiring quotes, the humour of the authors and the fabulous and down-to-earth method in which the book is written make it the finest of thousands of books on the same topic. Perhaps there is nothing really new in this book that you won't find elsewhere, but the authors work to make the readers realise their power, and the possiblity of their dreams.Granted, I am not one to carry out time consuming exercises in discovering my true passion, which this book contains a few of. I personally have never had the patience for them (perhaps the very reason my dreams are not yet a reality) but I believe they are important, and the authors present them in a way that simplifies the process of motivation.I found this book to be astonishingly good, wonderfully presented and researched, simple, and inspiring, much like 'You can't afford the luxury of a negative thought', another of their impassioned and humourous pieces. I feel like going out there and doing it right now; working to make my dreams come true, and after reading Do It!, I know it is not as hard as I have been led to believe. I cannot recommend this book enough.",

This book is light hearted but not for the faint of heart. Be prepared to make changes in your life and be open to facing some hard truths that you may not have known about yourself. Don't be intimidated by the size of the book --close to half of it is really one page motivational quotes. Most of the content is common knowledge but the goal of reading the book should be how to apply the knowledge. Perfect for any age and an excellent gift for those into self improvement. Take a look at the excepts and contents listed on Amazon and you'll see that it's never too late to just Do It !!!!!!",

Since each person has their own beliefs, this book easily covers everyone without offending anyone. I can not emphasize this enough: As a motivational wake up call, buy this book and read it every six months. Drill what he says into your head (only the parts you like, not the whole book is necessary) and you will be happier and more successful. Just reading the book won't do it.

Emails are. Cassie Woodson is adrift. After suffering an epic tumble down the corporate ladder, Cassie finds the only way she can pay her bills is to take a thankless temp job reviewing correspondence for a large-scale fraud suit. The daily drudgery amplifies all that her life is lacking-love, friends, stability-and leaves her with too much time on her hands, which she spends fixating on the mistakes that brought her to this point. While sorting through a relentless deluge of emails, something catches her eye: the tender (and totally private) exchanges between a partner at the firm, Forest Watts, and his enchanting wife, Annabelle. Cassie knows she shouldn't read them. But it's just one look. And once that door opens, she finds she can't look away. Every day, twenty floors below Forest's corner office, Cassie dissects their emails from her dingy workstation. A few clicks of her mouse and she can see every adoring word they write to each other. By peeking into their apparently perfect life, Cassie finds renewed purpose and happiness, reveling in their penchant for vintage wines, morning juice presses, and lavish dinner parties thrown in their stately Westchester home. There are no secrets from her. Or so she thinks. Her admiration quickly escalates into all-out mimicry, because she wants this life more than anything. Maybe if she plays make-believe long enough, it will become real for her. But when Cassie orchestrates a \"chance\" meeting with Forest in the real world and sees something that throws the state of his marriage into question, the fantasy she's been carefully cultivating shatters. Suddenly, she doesn't simply admire Annabelle-she wants to take her place. And she's armed with the tools to make that happen.",

The truth starts coming out, and bit by bit the story starts becoming more far-fetched. By the time this one is over, you'll be sitting there scratching your head and wondering why your name was left out of this book...after all, everyone else in the world was apparently in on this deception. The closest I can come to explaining this is a soap opera. As the end was revealed, it was like &quot;Your brother-in-law's second cousin's third wife's stepmother was married to my twice-removed uncle's niece's third child's grandson&quot;.

However, Coben does an excellent job with Grace and Charlaine, two strong, resourceful women. I was moved by his dead-on depictions of the special love parents have for their children. And his numerous pop culture references ring true.

Coben has again written another brilliant adventure full of twists and surprises but be warned his style is a bit different in this one to previous independent novels. It is not a bad thing but if you purchase only wanting his usual old style then you may want to know. In Just One Look Coben writes a lot of pages through the main villain's eyes, similar to the way Dean Koontz or James Patterson do. It works extremely well in this novel but obviously most Coben books have you guessing who the bad guy is for most of the book, I mean you still get to that with who hired psychopath pressure point assassin Eric Wu, but like I said it's a different style. Wu is an exceptional and very interesting villain, one of my favourites by any author. The other main difference is the main victim/hero of this novel is female (Grace Lawson) whereas usually the main character is male in Coben books but again this works sensationally here. I loved this new style and it complements and blends in well with Coben's successful traditional way of writing. Coben even has aspects of his last Myron adventure in here by talking about Little Pocahontas' trial which is happening in the same real time as this independent adventure.The basic plot of Just One Look is that Grace Lawson, crippled in the Boston Massacre years earlier and now mother of two young children picks up a developed roll of film from the mall and finds an old photo amongst it with a blond girl crossed out, and amongst other figures someone she thinks could be her husband. When Jack (her husband) sees the photo he leaves the house without telling her and never returns. This is because he has crossed paths with Eric Wu an ex Korean torturer now assassin for hire who knows how to bring anyone down with his bare hands and can paralyse just with one pinch. Who hired Eric Wu? What will Eric do to Jack and others? Who put the old mysterious photo in with the others? Why did Jack react the way he did to the photo? Can Grace protect herself and her family from its secrets?Check out Coben's other masterpiece independent novels as well such as Tell No One, No Second Chance and Gone for Good and also his Myron Bolitar series, I would recommend starting those from the initial Darkest Fear novel to get the most out of them.",

I loved the pacing, the intricate plot, and most of all the attention to family and relationship. &quot;Gone for Good&quot; and &quot;Tell No One&quot; were masterpieces of suspense. &quot;No Second Chance&quot; felt a bit more contrived, but I still enjoyed it throughout.&quot;Just One Look&quot; is full of suspense, no doubt about it. The plot unfolds in all the right places. The characters react as might be expected. Yet, I felt as though I was taking apart a music box that had been robbed of its melody. Coben's family rhythms and song seemed muted. The plausibility of the scenario was strained. Sure, I was entranced by Grace's search to discover the truth behind her husband's disappearance and a decades-old photo, but I was not emotionally invested.That said, Coben is a master of the serpentine mystery. My love for his writing is steadfast. Next time around though, I hope his characters have a little more time to look me in the eye and draw me into their world. In this book-dating scenario, for me, it's all about relationship.",
