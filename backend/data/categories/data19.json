                "review/text": "I was recently asked by someone who had read some of my reviews which study Bible I recommended. Such a hard question, since there are many excellent ones available! My answer to him compared the NIV Life Application Bible and the NIV Study Bible. Here are my thoughts on these two, plus comments on the Quest Study Bible as well.The Large-Print Edition of the NIV Study Bible doesn't have HUGE print - just a bit bigger than most Bibles. I still use that Bible a LOT and it's just comfortable reading. It is a bit bigger and heavier than my LAB, but not by a lot. I really like the larger type. You can get REALLY large print, but that's not what this is.The Quest Study Bible doesn't go as deep. I think it's perfect for someone who is just beginning to study the Bible and has lots of questions like those that are answered in the Quest Study Bible. However, that's not to say that I already know all the answers to those questions! ;-o It just doesn't go much deeper than those questions.I have in front of me the NIV Study Bible and the Life Application Bible NIV. They are both excellent - either one would go deeper into the Word than the Quest Study Bible.The obvious differences to me are as follows:Text The Life Application Bible (LAB) has the text straight across the page - the NIV Study Bible has the two-column layout. I think I prefer the two-columns. It is easier to get through some of those Old Testament books such as 1/2 Chronicles! ;-o However, this is very much a matter of personal preference.Notes The notes, while excellent in both Bibles, are different in tone. The NIV Study Bible notes are very objective and purely informational. One of the downsides to the LAB, for me anyway, is that sometimes the notes in the LAB get rather preachy and sometimes go far afield of the text. I'm not saying asking personal applications is a bad thing, but if you're doing a lot of reading in that Bible, it might get to be a bit much. The tone of the notes is is the reason I gave the Life Application Bible 4 stars instead of 5! A note might ask &quot;Do you believe that God can help you? Do you really want his help?&quot; (note for Matt 9:27-30).The clear, informative and objectively stated notes in this NIV Study Bible earned it 5 stars in my book!! I would, however, have appreciated lengthier personality profiles. But no study Bible has everything!Other helps In the back of the LAB, there is an &quot;Index to Notes&quot; which includes the maps, charts, personality profiles, and the notes. It really isn't a concordance, but it is helpful.The NIV Study Bible has an Index to Maps separately, an Index to Subjects, and a Concordance. The Concordance isn't exhaustive, of course, but it is much better than the one in the LAB.The LAB wins the contest in the &quot;Personality Profiles&quot; category. They have quite a detailed description of all the key people you'll meet in the Bible - they often cover about 2/3 of a page!! In the NIV Study Bible, these personality notes are relegated to just a few lines in the Notes section! The LAB definitely is the winner in this category.Both Bibles contain a Harmony of the Gospels, something I find really helpful. The LAB, however, numbers each event in the Gospels, and before the section in the text, it gives this number and then gives the passages in the other gospels that tell the same story. I found the number to be really helpful. The NIV Study Bible doesn't have such numbers.I could go on and on, but you get the idea! Those are the main differences, I think!! Both Bibles are excellent. I haven't found any others that are better. I also have the NIV Living Insights Study Bible that has Chuck Swindolls notes, but the notes aren't as complete. Also, the &quot;Word in Life Study Bible&quot; is chockfull of different kinds of sidebars and articles and is just wonderful as well.I had purchased the Large-Print Edition of the NIV Study Bible because of some temporary vision problems. I hope this is helpful! Please check out my other reviews of Bibles and other Christians books and contemporary Christian music!",

During discussions with friends or family, however, I saw a need to share the information contained within the Study Bible. Therefore, I always keep one here to study with, but I never put my name in it. I keep it &quot;unassigned&quot; until someone I know needs one, then I give them mine (but, of course, I still have my regular NIV and KJV, too). Invariably, this kind of &quot;opportune giving&quot;, that is, giving the Study Bible after a frank discussion of its contents, leads to eager reading. I gave one to my sister-in-law recently, who forgot to bring her KJV Bible while visiting. I lent my NIV Study Bible, and her eyes were opened to a whole new understanding. She was so enthusiastic about &quot;not having to translate&quot; what she had read (as she was used to doing with her KJV), that I offered her the Study Bible to take home. When she protested, I explained that I always kept one for expressly that purpose. It has become her study Bible of choice.

I prefer the NRSV for more serious study, but the NIV is a great devotional Bible.The King James Bible was the best in its day. In today's world, it is NOT closer to the original Scriptures as some think, but as its translators say in the forward, it is a revision of a revision and was meant to be improved upon as the English language evolved. That is what translations like the NIV and the NRSV attempt to accomplish. We have uncovered better Greek manuscripts now and understand the language better.",

Compare, for instance, these statements from the Introduction to Job:[1995 ed.] &quot;Two dates are involved: (1) the date of the man Job and his historical setting, and (2) the date of the inspired writer who composed the book.&quot;[2002 ed.] &quot;Two dates are involved: (1) that of Job himself, and (2) the composition of the book.&quot;While the editors have not gone overboard trying to turn the NIVSB into a &quot;pc/inclusive language&quot; text, they have restated a few things here and there that, to my sensibilities, seemed worth fixing. For instance:[1995 ed., from Wisdom Literature Introduction] &quot;The Jews sometimes speak of the OT as the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings.&quot;[2002 ed., page 725] &quot;An ancient tradition among the Jews divided the collection of their holy books into three major divisions: the Law (Pentateuch), the Prophets (Former and Latter) and the Writings.&quot;These are small but welcome changes. [For those who may be following the controversy about the &quot;Today's New International Version&quot; translation, an adaptation of the NIV which endeavors to use gender-inclusive language when both men and women are clearly being discussed or addressed, the NIVSB uses the &quot;unaltered&quot; NIV. This is a good choice for a Study Bible, since serious Bible students need to confront the patriarchy of the ancient world at some time or another. The notes, rather than the translation of the text, seems the best place to accomplish this.]Although I see nothing in the introductions and notes that should be alarming to the book's primary audience (Evangelical Christians), the NIVSB now seems worthy to be used by Christians from other Protestant traditions, as well as by the general reader who may be curious about the Bible as one of the most important texts of Western civilization.The NIVSB continues to use three &quot;icons&quot; with its introductions, charts, and notes: a &quot;seedling&quot; to suggest an item that will help the reader apply something to her/his personal life; a &quot;trowel&quot; to identify items based on archaeological discoveries; and &quot;a human head&quot; to call attention to items relating to key characters. One could read the notes carefully and dispute the way these icons have been assigned throughout the text, but the editors should be applauded for their judicious restraint. To tag more notes with icons (or to introduce more types of icons) would have created visual clutter. The publisher should also be applauded for making the icons gray instead of solid black as in the previous editon; it's easy to read around them. (I only pay close attention to the &quot;trowel&quot; icons, because I am personally curious about what in the Bible can and cannot be confirmed by external evidence; although I usually skip the &quot;seedlings&quot;--because I don't like to be told how to apply Scripture to my life--these notes often discuss key theological concepts and are equally worth reading.)The typography is improved in the 2002 edition, most notably in the center column reference system. However, I still find it difficult to know where to look when I see a superscript marker in the Scripture text (To the center column or at the foot of the Scripture text?). At some points in the text, there are two superscript markers! For example, the name &quot;Immanuel&quot; in Matthew 1:23 is followed by a roman superscript &quot;d&quot; and an italic superscript &quot;w.&quot; Oddly, both identify Isaiah 7:14 as the related text. Although, I suppose, there's nothing technically wrong with stating something more than once, I think it unnecessary in a book so tightly packed with information. The unintended effect on the reader might be to erode his/her willingness to pay attention to the notes or to bother to look things up. That would be unfortunate, indeed, because there's a lot in the revised NIV Study Bible that is worth checking out.",

                "review/text": "The main difference between this new 2002 and the previous 1995 revision is the inclusion of 800 new study notes. A quick browse through easily reveals a number of these, the first of which being at the first line of Genesis. There are also a number of explications to replace the frustrating \"See note at Psalm 15:2\" type of notes. Now they sometimes tell you why you should see it. Many of the earlier notes are also revised based on comments from seminary students, professors and pastors to bring them up to date with current conservative evangelical scholarship. There are also a few more charts in this version, a couple of new color maps (only dropping one, the pointless \"The World as it is Today\" from the previous edition). The typography is also slightly different, as are the icons used to denote archeology and life application passages. The font used for the headers is also different (in my view a slight improvement since it makes it easier to quickly spot stories and parables), and the comfortable font used for the Bible text itself remains unchanged. The standard edition is 2198 pages not including color maps, while the 1995 version was 2172. The spine of the leather version is also more stylish than the 1995 edition, simply stating \"Zondervan NIV Study Bible\" and \"NIV\" and \"Zondervan\" near the bottom. The 1995 edition said \"The NIV Study Bible\" \"New International Version\" \"Words of Christ in Red Letter\" and \"Zondervan,\" which made it a little busy. Oh, yes--the new version contains no family record pages, apparently realizing that study Bibles are used for study and not as heirlooms. There's only a nice presentation page and then it gets right into the timelines. All in all I highly recommend this update--and that's only after a quick browse-through! Frank",

While I use them all, my favorite for study and for Scripture reading is the NIVSB. The language is easy to understand and the study notes are fairly comprehensive. The commentary hails from a conservative evangelical theology.Book binding quality:The binding is strong and is durable. I've carried this Bible around a lot, and it has held up with no sign of failure.Scripture Page layout:The Scriptures are laid out in the natural paragraph form, rather than the bullet form based on verse numbering. The Scriptures are laid out in two columns, with a column for Scripture cross-references in the middle. The bottom of each page contains commentary listed by corresponding verse. The words of Christ are in red, and contextual sections have headings that correspond to the outline at the beginning of each book.Introduction to Books:Each book of the Bible has a discussion of the author, audience and purpose, date and place of writing, characteristics, sources and a short outline of the book.Commentary:The notes deal with archaeological, historical, lexical (minimal lexical inputs) and cultural aspects that pertain to conservative hermeneutical exegesis. In disputables, the often do make definitive conclusions, but also at times give different views giving info on what the editors believe is the most probable correct conclusion. It is impossible to put all information on a topic into a study Bible, but the NIVSB does a good job of packing a lot of information in for a significant level of understanding.Indices:There are several helpful and easy to use indices at the back of the Bible. An Index of Subjects acts as a topical study help. An Index of Notes acts as an index for the subjects of NIVSB commentaries. There are several map and measurement aids and finally a standard but fairly comprehensive concordance is included.A note on the NIV translation:The NIV translation is a controversial translation. It has begun to outsell the long-beloved King James Version (KJV) Bible. I am not here to say one translation is the one to read while another should be shunned. I prefer to study many different versions, hence my use of parallel Bibles. But, please know that many of the negative reviews tend to be based on dislike of the NIV translation. Until Zondervan creates a parallel study Bible, this will remain one of my favorite Bibles.To find comprehensive information of a topic or passage, I use my Thompson Chain Reference. For seminary study, I use parallel Bibles (Evangelical Parallel NT and NIV/KJV Parallel). For initiation of a study, reading and study away from home, I use the NIVSB. There is a wealth of information in this study Bible.",

                "review/text": "I received this Bible as a gift a number of years ago, and I've used it regularly ever since. Personally, I prefer the New American Standard version for studying and reading, but I always keep this Bible handy for its unbeatable study notes and cross references. The notes, written to be nondenominational and always upholding the infallibility of the Bible, shed light on difficult passages and historical information, helping readers get the most out of time spent in God's word. Bible book introductions are often several pages long and discuss the book's origins and themes. And between the cross references and the excellent included concordance, I've been able to examine what the rest of the Bible says regarding topics in the passages I've studied. In fact, I often copy information out of this study Bible and put it in my other Bibles, so that I can always have easy access to information about my favorite verses and chapters.How this Bible looks also makes it stand out. The leather is high quality and attractive. Inside, the font size makes reading easy on the eyes, and other formatting features help make the Bible simple to use and navigate. Its size makes it a bit cumbersome for everyday use while on the go, but for at home study and going to church, there's no problem.Bottom line: NIV fans who want excellent study supplements inside an attractive cover simply can't go wrong with this Bible. The highly respected, easy to read translation combined with top notch study notes, cross references, and a concordance make this Bible a great way to set out on the journey of studying God's word.",

                "review/text": "I was surprised by some of the negative comments about the NIV Study Bible, though my own opinions of it are less than raving about its perfection. While not the best around, I did find it has some definite redeeming features, (apart from the end, of course).The NIV has a very useful cross-reference system, (for which it is justifiably well-known), that makes pursuing a particular topic or item through the Bible very easy. This makes finding things a breeze. In addition, and contrary to some, the subject index and concordance are pretty good. Yes, they are very basic, but this is a Bible and not a concordance in itself. I did not find anything wrong with them, and they were pretty useful.There has been some comment about the introductions to each book, and I have found to be reasonably balanced and realistic about the evidence. In some cases, I would personally suggest even later dates for the books than the NIV gives. While the introductions are not perfect, (for more detailed information, see the real evidence out there), they do the job. I don't see how dating books accurately according to evidence is \"godless\" or in anyway detrimental to the Bible. Anyway, back to the point: the introductions are not detailed, but they are adequate for the task.I found the translation to be ok in most cases, though in some places, it seems to soften the ideas and teachings of Christ. This is noticeable when it is compared with other versions, which take a more literal translation as a technique. A teaching on marriage and not being married seemed to be softened in the NIV as compared to others. While I have no problem with the \"dynamic equivalence\" method, (it is not paraphrasing, as some seem to think), the NIV highlights the need to check with a couple of translations, unless you are going at it from the Greek, as well. This is something which makes me cautious to recommend the NIV as a primary study reference.While limitations of space have a significant effect on how much commentary you get, the NIV could have a little more. Admirable effort at leaving the real thinking to the reader, but in some nasty places there was very little commentary given, and it would have been useful.Overall, the NIV is not bad, and certainly not worth burning along with the other heretical works. It does a good job, and it has some very good features that make studying it easy, functional and even fun. Apart from the concerns above, it is pretty good.",

What I liked about it was that it is a widely accepted translation, excellent commentary on most every verse (important to someone like me that did not grow up reading The Bible), and a lot of contextual information (drawings, book introductions, etc).For the uninitiated, it is a toss-up between this and the Quest Study Bible, also published by Zondervan. The Quest has a slight edge for the lay person as opposed to the serious Bible student -- it has answers to a number of blunt questions that may cross your mind, but which do not classify as Bible Study.I purchased a leather bound edition of this Bible from an Amazon seller. It was brand new, in unopened packaging, in leather, for far less than the list price of the paperback version. So, shop around the Amazon marketplace sellers before you buy.The only quibble I have is that Zondervan does not stitch the spine of its Bibles (atleast not the one that I have). No matter how carefully you treat it, a stitched spine always beats a gummed spine. See if you can get an edition with a stitched spine for a few extra dollars. It will be worth it.",

I also have the Oxford New Annotated Bible and the Harper Collins Study Bible sitting on my shelf right now and the NIV is without a doubt my favorite and most helpful study bible (followed by the Oxford). The cross references may be the best thing about this study bible! They are amazing! If you wish to find any of the obscure Old Testament prophetic references in the book of Revelation, for example, the center column cross refernces are your best friend. In addition the NIV has (I believe) the largest concordance of any major study bible, which makes finding that reference that you only sort of remember much easier. The notes in earlier editions were slanted a bit in the Reformed-Calvinistic direction, but the revisions of the last few years are supposed to make for a more ecuminical study bible. The introductions to the sections and books are also very good, TONS of info is included about the historical contexts from which the different books come in addition to the theological emphases.

It combines a readable and reliable translation, excellent reference material, and unbiased commentary. I have seen this study Bible through all it's previous editions and am continually impressed.Pros:1) The readable and reliable NIV text.Some people can be rather critical of the NIV even to the point of accusing this translation of heresy. Such accusations are completely without merit. I have studied from the NIV for over 20 years and I have never found it to be anything but reliable.2) Excellent reference material.Cross-references, maps, charts, timelines, historical context, and more. This study Bible has just about everything you would need for a complete study of any given passage. Granted, space restrictions do not permit an exhaustive analysis of any of the above. However, there is more than enough information to satisfy all but the most intensive reader.3) Good commentary.The study notes offered in this Bible are excellent. They do not enforce any one denominational position and present various viewpoints on disputible issues.4) Easy to read print.I do not know what kind of font was used for the printing of this Bible but it is incredibly easy to read.Cons:1) Thin paper.Unfortunately the paper quality for many of Zondervan's Bibles has been rather poor recently. It is ultra thin, probably to allow for thinner Bibles. It can be distracting to see the opposite page through the one you are reading. Especially if the next page is a chart or a map. This can also cause problems for people who like to take notes in their Bibles.2) Only available in the NIV.As I've said in the Pros this format is very good for Bible study. It would be nice to have this available in another translation for those who prefer a more formal translation like the NASB or ESV. There is a Zondervan NASB Study Bible that is very similar but it has not been updated along with the NIV.Overall, I would recommend this Bible to any one who desires to dig into God's word for themselves.

Every page gives you some way to apply the lessons taught to help in your every day life. Facing the hard times life hands us, learning to forgive, relationships and how to become more involved are handled in a way everyone can learn. The Beauty tips may at first seem unseemly, but when you take time to read them you find a lesson. I like the Women of the Bible segments, brief biographies of some of the Bibles most famous (and infamous) ladies and what we can learn from their lives. The monthly calendars are interesting as well. I intend to buy the teen versions for my two nieces, and I am sure friends will be finding copies of this Bible wrapped in birthday paper over the coming months. I know they will love it and USE it as much as I will.",

                "review/text": "There are three big decisions involved in getting a Bible, not counting expense.The first is the translation. If you want something to give you an easy, casual reading, and you don't care about accuracy, then the NASB is not for you. If you want something that is fairly accurate, but don't really care if it is precise or not, then the NASB may or may not be the best choice for you.If, however, you believe that the Bible is the Word of God, and you want it translated into readable modern English as precisely as possible, because you want to apply the Word of God to your own life, then there is NO other translation that will do. From my perspective in comparing both the Hebrew and the Greek, there is no other translation that even comes close to the NASB for accuracy, with the possible exception of the NKJV, which to me ranks a fairly distant second.The NASB is written in clear, readable 12th-grade-level English. That makes it a bit difficult to read for some. If you are willing to put forth the effort to let your life be stretched by the Word, however, is it not also worth the effort to let your English be stretched by the most accurate translation?One of the commentators on here mentioned that he preferred the NRSV over the NASB for accuracy. I'm afraid that is simply not correct. The NRSV is loaded with inaccuracies in translation, which appear to me to have been deliberately inserted to skew the translation in favor of a particular theological viewpoint, making it one of the LEAST accurate translations available.The second big decision is what kind of study helps to get. I find the Life Application editions well organized, easy to use, and Biblically sound, but to each their own. I suggest looking at some friends' copies to decide for yourself.The third is what kind of cover. The top-grain leather is the only one that will last a lifetime. (I know, I've worn out two split-grain editions and a couple of vinyl editions.)Don't think of it as a book. Think of it as a lifetime companion on the road to glory.",

I needed help in understanding some of the phrases about what I was reading, and the advantage of this Bible is that this Bible contains very informative commentary and historical perspective at the bottom of each page which helps in adding meaning to Bible study.As a former seminary student, I hesitate using any single form of reference when it comes to commentary, but I've found this Bible reflects an understanding that I perceive to be quite accurate and reliable. At seminary, there was an overall consensus that the NASB (New American Standard Bible) was actually the most preferred of the updated versions of Scripture to the King James Version. The NASB version has the reputation for being one of the most, if not, the most accurate version which is expressed in plain English, making it easier to read. I have to admit that I prefer the elegance of the King James style, but understandably, it has proven to be difficult to interpret by many, thus creating a market for additional \"easy to read\" versions of the Bible, such as the NASB version.If you're like me, and appreciate getting some help in understanding as I study, I highly recommend the Life Application Bibles. Again, there will always be those with differing opinions and reviews, but I have appreciated this Bible enough to have one in King James Version and also [the] NASB version. Serious students, however, should study by using various credible research sources to obtain a sound biblical perspective. Be reminded that it's not always what is printed, rather how you interpret what is printed, along with the Divine relationship that you maintain. The key to biblical understanding is realizing and knowing that the credibility of Scripture comes from it's own text which has sustained the test of time, and that it encourages testing its wisdom against our experiences in life and all other forms of education. May the Lord bless all of you in your journey and pursuit of Truth.",

These definitions, cued to the Strong's numbering, are easy to read, accessible, and meaningful. Study notes are lucid, especially with their historical background. Of particular use to praise/worship leaders and songwriters, is the addition of the thematic outline of many of the Psalms in the study notes. All of the Psalms are song lyrics (not poems). The word Psalms is from the Greek psalmoi (and the Hebrew mizmer) which means to pluck. Hence, Psalms is an arranging term from the Temple indicating that these songs are to be performed with plucked stringed instruments. For Christian songwriters, these study notes can be an invaluable guide to not only better understanding the individual lyric, but equally in creating your own new ones.The text has a very balanced view of the Holy Spirit which few should find fault with. NT study notes are equally lucid especially in explaining certain cultural issues, alternate translation possibilities, and clarifying difficulties from the NKJV translation of the Pauline epistles.Center column references are very practical and useful. There is a brief subject index for those liking the Thompson Chain Reference approach, and an excellent concordance spanning about 200 pages. There is a comprehensive outline for each Bible book, nearly as deep as G. Campbell Morgan's Analyzed Bible.The graphic layout is quite good and easy to read. Of all study Bibles of all translations, I rank this #1, followed by the NIV Study Bible, and the Spirit Filled Life Bible (NKJV - Jack Hayford Editor), and Dake (KJV only). Thompson's has a totally separate study approach and therefore isn't quite comparable to the others.Key word for this study Bible: balanced.A readership note: The NKJV is about a 12th grade reading level. By comparison, newsmagazines are written with a 7th grade reading vocabulary. Readers looking for an easier reading translation would do well to consider getting the New Living Translation to complement the Nelson Study Bible NKJV.I've selected the Nelson's as the study Bible of choice for Alexander University students taking our online Christian songwriting classes.",

Understandably, you need to be careful with study bibles in case you begin to adopt the editors' slant on things, but from what I can tell the Nelson team has done a fine job of retaining the integrity of the NKJV translation in their commentaries.I'm still on the Old Testament (2 Kings right now) and I've throughly enjoyed most every single chapter so far. Thanks to the well-written and not-too-long commentaries on many verses it's easy to comprehend the significance of the passages and understand some of the ancient practices prevalent at the time.Great maps in-text and at the back, helpful tables of dates and events, thorough cross-referencing, definitions of especially meaningful words in the Hebrew context, as well as in-text discussions of major concepts make this a definitive study bible for any NKJV reader and also as a reference work.",

The devotional quality is achieved primarily through the tone of the copious and scholarly notes, which are reverent, main stream, and remarkably non-intrusive. I have a number of other study Bibles, and have generally found them lacking.I appreciate the lofty literary style of the King James (Authorized) version, and wanted to try the New King James (NKJV). I have spent hours comparing the two versions. The poetic books are almost unchanged except for long obsolete words, pronouns and inflectional verb endings. The meter is unchanged. Other books have been further updated with modern sentence structure where it is most needed. The result still sounds magnificent and timeless, and glows like a freshly restored work of art.The Nelson SB contains a remarkably comprehensive concordance which contains proper nouns and describes them within the concordance listing. Thus the concordance can also be regarded as a Bible dictionary.There are eight pages of color maps in the rear. I would have liked a color map showing the twelve tribes at the time of the judges (after Joshua's conquest of Canaan), but the intext maps show this very nicely, so this is a quibble.Nelson's SB is most remarkable for its highly tailored, complete and accurate annotations, which can only have been achieved through a devotion to the work and a lot of toil. This book is quite evidently a labor of love, and this, more than any other quality ranks it as the finest SB I've encountered.I received the black bonded leather edition. Its Gold stamped quality leather cover and gold edged paper, as well as the overall high quality of workmanship make this book a delight to the senses. A real treasure all 'round.",

Certainly, the editors and contributers of this translation achieved what was necessary for producing such an excellent Bible.The foreward proves itself very welcoming by concisely exerting the main features as a helpful tool in studying the Word of God. The preface explains the history of the NKJV, the precision and accurracy of the translation, the devotional style for the reader, and the general format for the Old and New Tesaments as a whole.Some aspects that will be beneficial and enjoyable while reading this Bible are the in-depth prolouges that describe who the author was, when it was wrote, and for what purpose the author served in writting the book. On top of all of this are finely arranged outlines and timelines to further your aquiantance with the general themes of that particular time in antiquity. There are 350 words held equivocal in this translation, so the scholars provived a section for these terms and called it 'word focus.' The words are discussed with regard to the context in which they are used, and their meanings and biblical usage are explained wonderfully. Also the scholarly commentary, the vast array of maps, pictures, charts, graphs, and cross-references add all the more radiance to this edition. To cap it off, there lies in the back a subject index to the annotations and special features provided in this Bible. Following that I found the Concordance and colorful maps in the back to further add prestige to the Nelson Study Bible.So for the overall quality of this Bible I would highly recommend this work to anyone who wishes to grasp ahold of a great study bible.

It looks great, but after a little use, it falls apart.Some of the graphics in this Bible are excellent. The frequent maps are helpful and the diagrams really explain the text. The page layout is clear and neat. The cross-references are thorough and have some fun features.But the annotations are awful. The annotators either ignore, or are unaware of, modern scholarship. The introduction to Genesis reads, \"Genesis was written and compiled by Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai\" (p. 1), ignoring source criticism. Song of Songs is \"a moving love story about a young country girl and King Solomon\" (p. 1097), ignoring the difficulties in interpretating this text. The annotations are padded with paraphrastic summary, and when they give information they tend to enter polemics (\"Mary was blessed because she received God's grace, not because she bestowed it\" [p. 1686]) or excuses (\"The apostles did not take Jesus' words to mean that they had the power to forgive sins\" [p. 1808]).Some of the features are superfluous. The \"WordFocus\" studies highlight words in Greek or Hebrew and give them lengthy explanations. This reflects an unfortunate Evangelical trend where people ignorant of Greek or Hebrew do \"word study\" with a lexicon. This leads to invalid doctrinal conclusions (cf. D. A. Carson's \"Exegetical Fallacies\").Some of the charts are great, but most are not. For example, see \"Isaiah: A Bible in Miniature?\" (p. 1144). Here we learn that Isaiah has \"66 chapters\" while the Bible has \"66 books.\" Entertaining, but a waste of space.Dr. Radmacher's essay on how to read the Bible is poor. The essay works from his premise, \"meaning is singular\" (p. xiii), which is not an historical Christian way of approaching the Bible. This \"fundamentalist\" approach is a disservice to both Fundamentalists and others.Finally, the binding: some of the pages fell out of the back after a year.If you want an explicitely Protestant study Bible, there are a host of others.

Also, I happen to prefer the \"Open\" with its dictionary at the beginning of the book, as it makes a nice buffer between Genesis and the cover. It greatly reduces wear in the spine in the first couple of books. The full color pages in the \"Nelson\" that I just mentioned make thumbing through the Bible a little difficult, as your page flipping becomes hindered by passing a glossy thick page every fow hundred pages. They just make the book overall open and lay awkwardly. The \"Open's\" layout is simpler and better, I think, and leaves much more Bible text per page. It's not cluttered with hundred of magazine-article like topic headings. In short, it's not worth the money to switch to the Nelson.Now, if you have neither, I suppose the best idea is to get a \"Nelson.\" For one, the \"Open\" is discontinued, so I guess you'd have no other choice in most cases, depending on which edition you're interested in, although there are still a few \"Opens\" for sale on Amazon. Overall, the \"Nelson\" is very full and informing. It makes a great secondary Bible, and if you don't mind many pages containing only a few paragraphs of Bible text, a great primary Bible.Doctrinally, the \"Nelson\" is fairly middle of the road. Pretty much any Christian would find this Bible usefull and non-threatening to their personal beliefs.Of all of the major study Bibles, the Nelson is quite the best choice for anyone.",

I've used The King James Study Bible by Thomas Nelson for a few years, and it's been extremely useful and informative. My wife uses The New Spirit Filled Bible (NKJV) which is also by Thomas Nelson. Those are the two Bibles I'll use in comparison to The Nelson Study Bible.The strength of this Bible is in the annotations at the bottom of each page. Nearly every verse is expounded upon. While I can't fault the editors for being thorough, the sheer volume of the notes causes one to bypass them altogether, unless he has a question about a specific verse. This version does not have any form of The King James Study Bible's Doctrinal Footnotes to lead the reader through a systematic study of the Bible's teachings. Nor does it offer Personality Profiles or Archaeological Sites, as the KJV does.This version does offer WordFocus Word Studies, which are very similar to Word Wealth offered in the New Spirit Filled Bible. In both versions, these are sprinkled throughout the text near relevant verses. Finding a particular word study is no problem in the Spirit Filled Bible, because there is an alphabetical listing of them at the front of the book. However, in this version the listing is not alphabetical, but instead lists them in the order they appear in the book, making it very difficult to find any particular word. The same is true of the listings for the \"InDepth Articles,\" the \"QuickView Charts,\" and the \"InText Maps.\" How hard would it have been to list these alphabetically? The WordFocus studies are not even cross-referenced in the text as they are in the Spirit Filled Bible, so finding one occurance of a word won't help you find its word study.Most Bibles have a section in the back where miscellaneous materials can be found. Things like a harmony of the Gospels, listings of the teachings of Christ, etc. This Bible does have many of these features, but they are spread randomly throughout the text. They are all listed in the tables of contents, but I've already described what a catastrophe those are.Despite the claims that this Bible was years in the making, I feel it is basically shovel-ware. There is little organization, and the features that are included are not easy to find. If bottom-of-the-page annotations are what you're after, this Bible offers lots of them.

The text on mine is a tad small, the genuine leather version is a tad pricy (as with anything, you get what you pay for), but I know it is something I'm going to use for years and years. You'll regret buying the &quot;other&quot; Bible on the rack. Trust me. It's easy to use and the cross reference system is a snap. The &quot;study&quot; notes are informative without being intellectually invasive. It's sturdy too (that's a real consideration if you take your Bible everywhere). I know I can spill coffee on it, use it as a pillow on long trips (leather softcover version) and still take it out and read God's word in small group study. Buy it. Real men still love Jesus.

Besides the copious and helpful notes, there is a subject index, concordance, and colored maps and a historical timeline. Interspersed throughout the entire Bible are pertinent maps, charts, outlines, etc. The KJV Study Bible also has brief word definitions or substitutions for outdated words listed in the center column, which is helpful if you prefer the KJV but stumble on some of the wording.The binding and pages are typical Zondervan---cheap and not likely to hold up long. I have the large print edition; the print is wonderful to read, but of course makes this book HUGE and heavy--not a Bible to carry around.All in all, this study bible will give you hours and hours of reading and study pleasure.",

There are over 40 major characters that receive extended articles from Abraham to the Woman at the Well. Under Paul's article, there are entries for specific events in his life, his missionary journeys, and the themes that run through his writings and teachings. Additional articles also give an overview of certain groups, such as the Judges, Kings, and Prophets.The only drawback to this book is the lack of a pronunciation guide (you'll have to look that up in the Bible Dictionary of the same series) but the meanings of names are given when known.

Although the font size is extremely small, the book comes with a handy magnification lence.It does not, hwoever, have a snap flap, or any oher sort of flap, to protect hte book, rather, it looks identical to a larger Bible, as just the covers.The edition I own, and displayed here, si the Authorised King James Bible,the most beutiful, stirring, and masterful translaiton in English, and the most Faithful translaiton thusfar in English.I know others will disagree, and one reviewer even used this as a con, but it is the Bible of preference for me, without getting too much into a debate.It certainly is a helpful Bible to have on hand for travels or small trips, and will be a blessing to whoever owns it.Mine has withstood abuse, and keeps on standing up, with crumpled pages and a bent cover, but still usable and in excellent shape.

The font size is larger than I thought it would be, and makes for very easy reading. There is plenty of room on each side margin for notes, and also many blank pages at the back for more detailed and complete notes or observations. The size of this bible is very nice for me as well, as it's somewhat smaller than most wide margin bibles, which I find easier to carry in my everyday reading and studying. Also, the binding, although somewhat stiff now (I can tell it's brand new), is well done and should soften up nicely with age. Finally, I like the fact that there are no commentaries or notes at the bottom of the page. I like to learn about the bible on my own, and I find this one very helpful because I don't have someone else's notes taking up space.Now - the negatives:1) The words of Christ are in red-letter format. This doesn't bother me at all, but I know it does some people, so if this is important to you, you might want to look elsewhere.2) There are very few references to other verses, and little in the way of footnotes. If you are looking for a comprehensive study bible, this isn't the one for you.3) There are no wide margins on the top and bottom of the text - only the outside margin. I don't mind this, but if you need the extra room, this one might not work for you. (Although the text is single-column, so you don't have to worry about fitting as much on a page as you would if you were writing notes for two columns.)All in all, I enjoy this bible very much. The font size, margin space, and physical size work very well for me, and although it's not the most comprehensive bible out there in terms of notes and references, if you're like me and just want to discover the text of the bible for yourself, but need a little extra margin room for notes, you should find this bible very helpful and useful!",

There is a decent amount of space on the margin on each page to write your study notes right next to the Scripture passage. And there are even blank pages at the end of the Bible specifically designed for the purpose for writing additional notes.Even though I only just received the Bible, I have already put it to use and it is already one of my favorite Bibles I have ever owned because it is so useful and practical.One thing that may be a detraction for people is the absence of study notes or commentary in the Bible. For me, though, this is actually a bonus. I do not dig built-in study notes or commentary in the Bible. I also appreciate the single-column format of the Bible-- it makes it more readable for me.What could have made this a better study Bible for me are several things. First, I actually would have liked slightly wider margins on the side, as well as larger margins on the top and bottom of each page for additional space to take notes. I also would have liked even larger print. I also do not dig Christ's words in red. I prefer black lettering throughout the Bible. I also wouldn't have minded a larger concordance in the back either. But I suppose you can't have everything.Again, if you like to take notes in your Bible and find that you never have any room, this Bible is for you.

At 1616 pages long, it's not so big that it's cumbersome to carry around. The page layout, and print are attractive and easy to read. The paper quality is better than average, though I prefer the paper in the Cambridge and Thompson Bibles.This Scofield is published by Oxford. They use a KJV text with the old time spellings: saviour, privily, and etc. If you compare the Oxford Scofield KJV with the Cambridge KJV Bibles you will find that while the Cambridge updates the spelling in a few places, in the Oxford Scofield it is updated in only a very few places. This would be very important to someone who wants to be sure he has a \"genuine King James Bible.\" The only places that I found where the spelling was changed my Scofield was the use of \"inquire\" in place of \"enquire\" in Genesis 24:57, and the use of the lower case \"s\" in place of the upper case \"S\" in Matthew 4:1.The only downside to this edition is that Scofield can go off on a tangent with some of his notes, although I did find them helpful more often than not.The other strong point of the Old Scofield KJV is that the concordance is among the best that I've seen in a medium priced study Bible. I've got about six daily use Bibles including some by Cambridge and Thompson Chain, (see my other reviews) yet this is one of my favorites. Amazingly enough, the Scofield was the most inexpensive.

It has even turned me back to using the KJV (I was reading the NIV before...).One thing that I don't buy in the notes is the support of the events that allegedly occured between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2 (the Gap Theory). The Scriptures used to support this position are questionable for this application. Of course, no notes added to a study Bible are ever going to be infallible. Only Scripture can make that claim. Overall, this is the best study Bible available for serious study of God's Word. Just make sure that you get the OLD Scofield Study Bible (Not the New politically correct one).",

Since i knew about Scofield's Study Bible i decided to buy it. In fact, i bought it just before i started the course. The \"Scofield\", beeig of such importance to Evangelical Theology, would be the best choice i guessed to go with the BSC from Moody.I must say, i really don't regret buying this wonderfull commentary. I know the pro's and con's about Scofields ideas on some matters, i know some see him as a \"fundamentalist\" and i don't share all his ideas either but still i'd suggest you buy it anyway. Especially since a lot of the 1917 edition is Gaebelein's work. Apart from that it has a load of cross-references and a great concordance (as more people wrote before).The Bible itself is leatherbound, thumb-indexed and with \"gold-print\".

        "description": "Male alliances, partnerships, and friendships are fundamental to the Hebrew Bible. This book offers a detailed and explicit exploration of the ways in which shared sexual use of women and women's bodies engenders, sustains, and nourishes such relationships in the Hebrew Bible. Hebrew Bible narratives demonstrate that women and women's bodies are not merely used to foster and cultivate male homosociality, male friendship, and toxic hegemonic masculinity, but rather to engender them and make them possible in the first place. Thiede argues that homosocial bonds between divine and mortal males are part of a continual competition for power, rank, and honor, and that this competition depends on women's bodies for its expression. In a final chapter, she also explores whether female characters in the Hebrew Bible use male bodies to form friendships and alliances to advance female power, status, and rank. The book concludes by arguing that women are essential to the toxic biblical hegemonic masculinity we find in the Hebrew Bible, but only because their bodies are used to make it possible in the first place. This book is intended for scholars of the Hebrew Bible, as well as advanced undergraduate and graduate students in religious studies, women and gender studies, masculinity studies, queer studies, and like fields. The book can also be read profitably by lay students of biblical literature, seminary students, and clergy.",

This bible is pretty easy to read (though not as easy as the NIV or NLT) but it is also considered to be the most literal English translation today.This is a nice personal sized bible, and it is perfect for a daily reader and a bible to take to bible studies and church. Every book has a summary at the beginning, and there are a couple of maps and other types of study aids that are scattered throughout the bible. Otherwise, it is a plain, center column reference bible and it is a red letter edition (which I personally like).But the one major problem I have had with this bible is the binding. The pages are simply glued into the spine, and because of that, after a few months, whole sections of my bible began to fall out. I had to use Elmer's glue to re-glue the sections back in, and thankfully, that seems to have done the trick for now.Still, the font size is nice, the center column references are nice, and the bible is a nice size and the price is fantastic. The only really complaint I have is the binding, and had the binding not been an issue, I would have given this bible 5 stars. But since losing whole sections from the binding isn't a small problem, I am forced to give this bible 3 stars.This bible is great for a daily reader, but if you're looking for a bible that is going to last a lifetime, or at least a really long time, I would suggest spending a little extra to make sure you get a bible that is bound better.",

In more that 300 engaging and insightful portraits, Edith Deen brings alive the saints and sorceresses, queens and servants, mothers and daughters, wives and widows whose profound influence is felt through-out the Bible. \"You can almost trace light and darkness in the Bible by the women themselves,\"she writes. \"Hannah, praying mother of Samuel, gave birth to a son who became the first great Hebrew prophet. And, of course, there was the mother of Jesus. On the other hand, Jezebel and Herodias were vile influences, the first tearing apart the northern kingdom of Israel, the second causing John the Baptist to be beheaded.\" Combining thorough detail with a lively and dramatic narrative, All of the Women of the Bible portrays the real women behind the Biblical stories and shows how, in their human struggles and triumphs, they are very much like the women of today. With each major biography identified by Bible chapter and verse and prefaced by a key passage of scripture, this is an ideal resources for teachers, Bible students, preachers, and writers, as well as anyone who wants to learn what it was really like to be a woman in Biblical times.",

Whenever my interest in the Church and the Bible was awakened, however, it was due to interest in the writings of the Bible.Whatever the initial reason that my interest in the Bible was inspired, however, I always read about the same topic: women and, in particular, the heroic women who were respected and revered by their husbands, families, and/or nations. I wanted to find women to emulate.This book is the best I have read on the subject of women in the Bible. Deen's work remains concise, while she makes you feel as if you know each character as a woman and as a part her place in history. Then, after writing these evocative passages, she has useful appendices such as an alphabetical listing of each woman who is named in the Bible and a brief description of each, a listing of women according to their station in life, a bibliography, and an incredibly in-depth index. This is a book that you will refer to throughout your life, whether you are looking for an interesting story, you want to learn about the age these women lived in, or you simply need inspiration. No matter your need, this book can fulfill it.",

Or was it? Edith Deen has compiled all the data necessary to answer that question. She has reviewed every woman mentioned in the Bible, those whose names were given, and those who were unnamed. She has pointed out those who were &quot;leaders in front&quot; and those who were &quot;leaders behind.&quot;She has also listed them according to their roles in the family: daughters, wives, mothers, widows. There is an excellent index to help you further find them by their roles (e.g, &quot;Warfare, women taking action in&quot;). This is a delightful book, whether you are wanting to discover what roles women played in ancient Israel, or whether you just want a book that has sections that you can read quickly for a short moment's diversion.",

I have used the Open Bible, Thompson Chain, Matthew Henry Study Bible, Dakes, Word, and Scofield to name a few. The notes and helps in each of these have their particular strengths and weaknesses. I could comment on each but will not. For my expository style of study, I have found that I like the Ryrie by far the best. What I am looking for is insight into the scripture for what it actually means, giving consideration to the original intent of the author, NOT JUST A PRETTY DEVOTIONAL THOUGHT. In the Ryrie, notes on Old Testament symbolism with New Testament fulfillment are great. In particular the notes in Hebrews are very well thought out. The notes in the Gospels are also excellent.Dr. Ryrie chose his words in his notes to be concise meaningful but not overly wordy. This allows for the Bible not to be cumbersome to use with overly exhaustive notes that give repetitious lists (i.e. Dakes). If I had to choose one study Bible for the rest of my life this would be it.My only regret: I purchased the less expensive bonded leather rather than the genuine leather. Now I have a favorite Bible that is full of my own hand written notes and underlined passages, but the cover is separating. Oh Well...TRW",

I took it out of the box, opened it to about the center pages, browsed a little, then turned back to the front cover.It had already started to tear from the binding. I looked at the very back, and the same thing. A small tear in the upper part of the cover.If this is \"genuine leather\" I'll BBQ it and eat it without any steak sauce. I noticed the Bible was printed in Columbia. It looks like it. It must have been from a shop in the jungle. I can't believe the poor, poor quality of this bible. I just lost $75 for the worst quality product I've ever been unfortunate enough to buy.One other tip while I'm at it. Just because a bible says \"genuine leather,\" don't let that fool you. There is genuine and then their is actual GENUINE. I thought I could trust Moody. What a mistake that was. This is even poorer quality than the \"bonded leather\" junk these publishers push on the public. They need to have Lewis Printing of Vermont print their bibles. Now there is genuine quality.Save your money. DO NOT BUY THIS product. Go to the salvation army and spend a dollar for a bible. It will be better quality.Moody should be embarrassed by this absolute piece of junk they are inflicting on the public. I will NEVER buy ANYTHING sold by Moody again.All I can say is the bible is pathetic, Moody should be ashamed of themselves, and Columbia needs to use labor that have worked in the printing industry before.Once again, save your hard earned money and do not buy ANYTHING by Moody. How cheap can these corporations be?On a more positive note, the Ryrie Study Bible, leaving out the printing quality, is one of the best study bibles I've ever owned. There is room in the margins for notes, the print is good size, the notes are extensive, and of course, Dr Ryrie is an excellent expositor of scripture. The notes are much more comprehensive than the Scofield Study Bible, dealing with subjects other than just prophecy. The contents of the Ryrie Study Bible can't be beat, it's the quality I have the problem with.",

The footnotes really help in that respect.My only wish for this Bible is that it included the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical books, but I suppose the omission is understandable, given (as I perceive it) the predominantly evangelical theological orientation of the contributors and editors.",

Two reasons. If you are buying a study Bible, you are obviously doing it to study the Bible. That being said, a KJV is the version you need because Strong's Concordance is keyed to it (you need a Strong's if your going to study also). The second reason is that every study Bible that I have picked up adheres to some particular doctrine and is weighted toward it. This is the most doctrine neutral of all the ones that I own.

There is a time line of events in the book at the top, a few paragraphs summarizing the message of the book, and a chart of the themes. My favorite feature of this Bible is that it is not separated into columns, and it is in paragraph form, both of which make reading much smoother, and like a normal book. The bottom half of the page is notes about specific verses such as 2:13 and then the note. Sometimes they are spiritual and sometimes they are practical explaining the culture, or why something was significant. Underneath the Bible verses, and above the notes are definitions of certain words in the Bible such as: 1:2 rent: torn Obeisance: bow low. There are all kinds of charts in this Bible and hundreds of personality profiles. Also lots of maps, which are great for understaning battles. There are all sorts of helps in the back of the Bible such as Table of Weight and Measurements, a Master Index, and a Dictionary/Concordance.

Now when I read a regular Bible I realize how much I don't like all the hyphenated words and constantly going to the next line. As for the Life Application comments, what I like about them is that since they take about a quarter to a half of most pages, they provide a place for notes.
