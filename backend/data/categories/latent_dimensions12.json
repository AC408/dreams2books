Even so, I was hesitant to get this level because I didn't see how the layout was going work. I needn't have worried.The previous level book (Very Easy True Stories) is set up so that there are illustrations with captions. This level has the the same clear illustrations, but the story is written in paragraph form on the the facing page. What I do is use the book as a speaking tool. I have my students read the story and then tell it to one of their classmates, or to me, pointing to the illustrations to help them continue. Having the story on the opposite page means that I can cover up the words and so they have to search their minds for the appropriate vocabulary instead of continually looking for the word on the page.I have used this method with students from every leel and because the stories are so captivating, it works very well for all. The students are barely conscious that they are learning new vocabulary; they are excited to be speaking and telling an interesting story.Each story is followed by exercises which reenforce the vocabulary and act as indicators as to whether the student has understood both the specifics and the general idea of the text.I hope that the author comes out with a second part of this level as she's done with the first level.",

I borrowed several and found this one to be the best for starting reading. The stories are extracted from newspaper articles that are gossipy and that have vocabulary words related to current life. For example, there are stories about true love, tatoos, how to find a spouse, etc.The articles are charming and they are good humoured. My neighbors got a good laugh out of the first story about a couple with mattress problems. This was a great beginning for their work with me. The other stories have helped the students open up and talk about their lives in English.I do think the exercises after the stories could be more relevant and more conducive to drilling. I can't move through the book very quickly because it doesn't pick out grammar and idioms for my students to study. However, it has some very good conversation topics in the teacher section. It also has some writing exercises.In the past, I have taught foreign languages to high school students but never English as a Second Language to adults. This is a new experience for me. I do think that this is the best material I have found so far to keep the students engaged and get them thinking about the words they need in daily life.It will take a long time to finish all the articles and then I will be able to update this review.",

The stories them selves are intriguing, but it was my students' own related stories which made them like the book.

It has high interest stories written with high frequency verbs in past simple, it introduces one or two new vocabulary words in each story and then repeats them so that the students learns them easily while reading the story. There are questions and activities which I don't use but are well thought out. The stories really capture the attention of all of my students and don't condescend at all.I have my students read the stories in English, translate them to Spanish (I teach in Spain and have found that their comfort level goes way up when they fully understand the story and can process it in their minds in Spanish), and then ask them to relate the story back to me in their own words in English. It's been an absolute revelation. The fact that the stories are true means that the students relate to the stories more easily and appreciate them. I bought the intermediate level book which was too big a jump and introduces too many new vocabulary words for my students, but I'm going to try the high beginner book.I can't recommend this book highly enough.",

        "description": "An angel spreads his wings. . . . Sonny Barger is the number-one spokesman for the motorcycle experience. His New York Times bestseller, Hell's Angel, was an exhilarating history of his adventures with the world's most notorious motorcycle club. Now he brings us rousing, moving, and wildly entertaining true stories of his renegade brothers and sisters in the relentless pursuit of liberty, individuality, and the \"ultimate ride.\" And what stories he has to tell -- freewheeling, bare-knuckle tales of brawls and battles, brotherhood, breathtaking adventures, crazy quests, and the inevitable classic scrapes with \"John Law.\" The most colorful legends and unforgettable characters of biker lore come alive in this book. In addition, celebrities like Steve McQueen, Johnny Paycheck, and David Crosby thunder through these pages in a sensational collection of rebel tales that runs the gamut from poignant and inspiring to thrilling and utterly outrageous. Whether you ride, have never ridden, or dream of riding, Ridin' High, Livin' Free is a reading experience you won't soon forget -- a fascinating glimpse into a unique culture of freedom that recognizes only one commandment: the code of the road.",

He's managed to make money of the Hell's Angels for fifty years now. That's pretty impressive. And to be willing to openly discuss portions of his life in that society takes guts. However, this book falls short in many areas.One, the few stories that relate to the Hell's Angels are over-the-top. It's just too hard to believe these exploits.Two, the non-Hell's Angels stories aren't any better. The picture painted of bikers throughout this book is that they are greasy, dirty, smelly and disgusting. Even the women profiled here are portrayed as little more than tramps.Three, we're subjected to Barger's attempt at fiction. Atleast it's only boring, unlike his actual fiction book (DEAD IN FIVE HEARTBEATS), which is a fictionalization of his autobiography with some preposterous action sequences thrown in.So, if you're really into juvenille biker stories, this is up your alley. If not, but you want to explore this genre, there are plenty of better books available.",

Now, whether this person is himself or not, I think that this person has imbibed in way too many foreign substances. There's multiple stories of running around and talking to ghosts, taking ghosts for rides on their motorcycles, then hooking the ghost up with ol' ladies in the ghost world, etc. There were other typical Sonny Barger hidden slams about other clubs selling their old ladies in houses of ill repute, when in reality, it's much more believable were it to have been a confession. Either way, I really like the quote from Freewheelin Frank in his own book (a 60's paperback, now out of print) where he Quotes Sonny as saying: &quot;When I make money from the patches on my back, I will no longer be a Hell's Angel&quot;.

Barger has reinvented the story of the gang-beating of Hunter Thompson. Skip Workman himself admitted in a 1967 television interview that women once in a while needed to be beaten like a rug. A woman's beating is the reason Thompson expressed his disapproval and was subsequently beaten (Workman's comments were specific to the Thompson beating). Barger softens the story in the book, as part of his overall attempt to change the reputation of the club and make them appear to be heroes. Barger further hopes to canonize himself through this self-fashioning. Once this credibility is broken, one cannot help but question the account of Barger's wife's accidental death while attempting to self abort. Barger freely admits he did not want children. As long as you are ready to indulge the over 60 Barger's attempt to use this quick read to convince you he is an American hero (he supported the Vietnam war), take a peek, it won't take much of your time.",

All they had was a collection of short stories that I didn't remember ever having heard her talk about, called The Moths and Other Stories. I picked it up, bought it, and by the end of the day had finished reading it. What a great collection of stories it is. It's so enjoyable to read that you finish it before you would like to.

I found these stories at turns fascinating, poignant, and annoying. The Moths is a touching and true-feeling story of devotion between a dying grandmother and her granddaughter. As one reads of the narrator tenderly bathing her disoriented, cancer-gnawed grandmother, the question occurs: Is the author commenting on the selfishness of our attempts at helping others, our efforts offshoots of a feeling of \"obligation\" to our benefactors? Or is it a comment on the Hispanic family structure, or merely an illustration of one moment?Growing is a bittersweet story of sisterly devotion, from the hispanic perspective. Naomi evolves from a perception of her younger sister Lucia as an onus (an escort) to a realization of her as a worthy, budding human being, all of which has for a catalyst a game of baseball played by some barrio children.Birthday involves a young girls abortion, and is the sometimes lamentable introduction of stream of consciousness into the author's stories. Other stories become more disturbing, both in topic (The Cariboo Cafe masterfully treats the brutality of the border patrol while neighbors studies the disintegration of urban hispanic neighborhoods), while Snapshots, the story of an old woman deemed crazy for her attachment to the past, is infused with a doleful brilliance.I have boundless respect for the technique of stream of consciousness, from Faulkner's babbling yokels to Woolf's introspective, ethereal characterizations. But it has to be done sparingly (especially these days, when the technique is old hat) and adroitly. These two stipulations are the only two for which Miss Viramontes does not answer in full on this work. Still worth your time, though.",

In the spirit of Borges and Calvino, Dasgupta's writing combines an energetically modern landscape with a timeless, beguiling fairy-tale ethos, while bringing to life a cast of extraordinary individuals-some lost, some confused, some happy-in a world that remains ineffable, inexplicable, and wonderful. A Ukrainian merchant is led by a wingless bird back to a lost lover; Robert De Niro's son masters the transubstantiation of matter and turns it against his enemies; a man who manipulates other people's memories has to confront his own past; a Japanese entrepreneur risks losing everything in his obsession with a doll; a mute Turkish girl is left alone in the house of a German man who is mapping the world. Told by people on a journey, these are stories about lives in transit, stories that grow into an epic cycle about the hopes and dreams and disappointments that connect people everywhere.",

The reviews were very \"literary\".To my pleasant surprise, it is more accessible than I expected. There are 13 short stories of varying styles. The stories are told by travelers stranded in the Tokyo airport (hence the title). They are told in various forms: fables, modern tales, a sectioned/outline format, and set in modern and fanciful times. Be prepared to suspend reality. This is one of those books that can be read on many levels. I enjoyed the stories in and of themselves, but also enjoyed thinking about them afterward. I plan to read the book again. I suspect I will get more out of it on the second reading.Dasgupta has an interesting writing style. I was often amused, occassionally embarrassed or surprised, sometimes sad or even bemused... overall a very interesting book. I still don't \"get\" the Frankfurt Mapmaker story, but I enjoyed it. Hmmm...I'll surely read it again. The Billionaire's Sheep was powerful - it made me think. I don't want to give anything away here - please forgive my generalizations.This book is not of the IWE (Indians Writing in English) genre, though the writer has a good command of India. This is not Lahiri, Mistry or any other Indian writer - so don't expect that kind of novel. (Though I have enjoyed Lahiri and Mistry.)Dasgupta has his own voice. I plan on recommending this to a few friends who I think would appreciate this unique book.",

I was expecting something connecting the stranded passengers but I really did fall into the magical realism we're used to finding from writers like Isabel Allende et al. Actually none of the stories relate to each other (excepting some references in the last story to earlier incidents) though they all demonstrate the writer's knowledge of capital cities and some astude references to current global affairs (eg, the economic crisis in Argentina). I loved the unrealistic side of the tales, the exploration of the depth of the human mind and the concept of dreams as reality. Its refreshing to read such an International book (meaning, you really couldn't tell where the author is from by just reading the stories). I believe this is Rana Dasgupta's first book and I really have to give him credit for his incredible style and the enormous amound of research that went into the work. If I was to find one fault (and this is the only one) and while I really enjoy the style of writing and the great idea of using stranded/bored passengers to share their stories...........they all had the same style and they all used the same bizarre magical reality throughout. Some more individualism (ie, a different storytelling style) might have added to the authenticity of the situation.........The odds of finding 13 excellent storytellers on a stranded flight seems a little too incredulous! All in all, however, this was an excellent Summer read and I thoroughly recommend picking it up soon.",

The premise is what made me initially interested: a group of 13 strangers are stranded in the airport in Tokyo for the night and decide to pass the time by telling stories. Sounds interesting, right? I thought that the stories would be global and realistic stories about people and life. I was wrong. The stories are certainly global, and the author describes beautifully each city in the book with intimate knowledge, but the collection of stories are more like fairy tales and fantasies. I did not fully understand many of the stories, but the book kept me reading nonetheless. Overall, it was not a bad book, just different. The author writes well, and for the imaginative, this may be a great book. I just think that I would have liked similar stories about life told without the fantasy better.",

That's fine in small doses but it doesn't add much to understanding characters or life in general. The \"plot\" device of 13 people stranded in an airport could have been something interesting but there is only one of the passengers who is given any identity at all so, an interesting situation is wasted and we know nothing of the people who are telling these stories.

In fact, it would be blasphemous to mention the two in the same breath. The book's concept is great-- 13 strangers are stranded at an airport and each has a story to tell, but it wasn't handled adequately. Each story is creative, no doubt, and imaginitive, but at the same time many are familiar. Others are grotesque. The voice doesn't change at all throughout the book. The only somewhat interesting thing the reader can notice is the different locations in which Dasgupta sets the stories, other than that, the book becomes remarkably dull. It's almost impossible to read in one sitting as the style becomes repetitive.The actual writing is good at times, the descriptions in particular are a treat, however Dasgupta at times inserts a \"twist\" into a story that seems completely ineffective and juvenile. Such as the image of the grim reaper in the middle of the short story: The Memory Editor (the image is meant to symbolize the main character's paranoia, I suppose, but is useless and sudden, and the \"twist\" ends abruptly with the main character realizing it's Halloween.)The last thing about this book is the background story. I mentioned before that it should not be compared to The Canterbury Tales, and I'll state it again. The stories are meant to have been told by some unnamed member of the 13, however, several stories are not formatted to be told verbally, which is why I thought the background story should've been eliminated completely. For example, in The Billionare's Sleep, there is a string of dialogue involving the billionaire, his wife, a customer, and a telecom operator. Without any breaks between quotes, the dialogue becomes jumbled to the reader, and most be even more difficult to understand if heard out loud.Overall the stories seemed rushed, with no specific thought put into how they would come together, and although descriptive and at times creative, the book leaves much to be desired. Overall quite a big disappointment.",

So, it made me wonder just how many other works in this book were also excerpts.To me, there were lots of other wonderful stories by well known authors, such as Sandra Cisneros, Richard Rodriguez, Gloria Anzaldua, Rudolfo A. Anaya and many more. Each of them were unique with the topics they've chosen as well as their writing styles.There were many topics covered in the stories. However, just about almost everyone had a similar experience. Topics covered death, education, religion, Spanish, English, gringos, food, social norms and many more. Experiences were similar when it came to social norms, teachers, Catholic schools, pronunciation of names and the like. I could relate to some of them, which made some stories more cherished than others. There were a couple of stories that I just could not \"get it\".Nonetheless, it was a good read. I just wished that there were no excerpted stories. Excerpted stories feel abrupted and it's mainly because you're only read a sample.

Unfortunately this was the farthest thing from reality.Most of the stories in this book are watered down versions of the stories that they are aiming to tell, and were one to tell these stories in the company of others who knew other versions, it could prove very embarrassing.The authenticity of the rest of the stories became suspect for me, when the stories which are fairly common knowledge were twisted in such a way as to use them to forward the Noble Savage myth/ ideal, and to perpetuate a set of beliefs that are not necessarily true, accurate or useful.The questions are leading, overly touchy feely and over explain the stories in an attempt to guide the reader to the authors already pre-determined conclusions about the intentions of the story. A prime example being The Woman Who Fell From the Sky, significant portions that don't contribute to the readers perception of the heroines persona are excluded and other aspects completely altered. Significant details are missing, which create the balance of the story, leaving it polarized and creating a cut and dry Mother Goose and Grimm good and bad guy, rather than illustrating the depth and interplay of the forces within the story. To see such an awesome and colorful story flattened to yet another supergirl story was just sad. Bits and blurbs, and dirty ditties season the book in an effort to keep the reader believing the picture the author is trying to paint.These stories are not being used to teach tradition, standards of behavior or anything else - unless one is seeking to reaffirm what a special little snowflake floating through a sea of fire they are.I was incredibly disappointed.",

Filled to the brim with rural anecdotes, for womenfolk and fellas alike, \"Pissing in the Snow\" is sure to get any reader plumb excited.All regionalisms aside, I truly did enjoy this book. It starts a bit slow, but once the old-fashioned nature is understood and appreciated, the country boy jokes about bodily functions and not-so-veiled references to intercourse keep the laughs coming. Replete with colloquialisms such as \"twitchet\" for female sexual anatomy and \"tallywhacker\" for the male organ, the stories should elicit a sense of nostalgia from anyone who's heard a good campfire joke told by someone from The Great Generation.Most of the time the stories revolve around a preacher, a traveling salesman, clever country folks tricking dumb city folks, or the ubiquitous farmer with a young nave daughter about to be deflowered. The language used throughout is interesting to say the least, with improper verb conjugation and pronoun usage sentences like, \"That's just what Bobby Ray done, too!\" are not uncommon.My favorite part of each story was the ending. Each ending is supposed to confirm the veracity of the story, but only adds doubt. It's like hearing someone end every story with, \"For real!\" They come across like a story from your Grandpa, creating a positive, enjoyable vibe that amplifies the innocence past. Without what would be considered vulgarity by today's standards, \"Pissing in the Snow\" proves there is more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to humor. There may be times when readers from the big city will dismiss this as boring or unintelligent, but I reckon if you-uns read this here collection of stories you'll think differently, because Amazon readers is smarter than that, anyhow.",

You might imagine my delight to find that in addition to some very funny, albeit very crude and crass, stories, there was a thoughtful, intellectual critical introduction and a series of short annotations after each nasty excerpt, including thematic code numbers under the Stith Thompson indexing system. I simply can't recommend this book to highly for anyone with earthy tastes, but an aspiration toward the higher and more thoughtful aspects of the vulgar.

He has written novels ranging from politics (First Among Equals) to revenge (Not A Penny More, Not A Penney Less) to corporate rivalry (The Fourth Estate), all of which have elements of his trademark 'twist' at some point.I awaited To Cut A Long Story Short with much anticipation, as I strongly believe that writing short stories is what he does best.I found this book highly enjoyable though certain stories were a little disappointing.'The Endgame', 'The Grass Is Always Greener' and 'Chalk And Cheese', were especially entertaining. 'The Grass Is Always Greener', in particular, I thought was a really superb read, both in terms of content and language. One aspect of Archer that makes his books so zestful and fun to read is his balanced usage of simple and complex language.Then again, I found 'A Weekend To Remember' rather dull and mundane. Perhaps the plot was rather limited as it was based on a true incident.Archer has written two very short stories, 'The Letter' and 'Love At First Sight'. These were not exceptionally good, but then, how many of us can produce really good short stories?Contrary to the five stars displayed, I award this book 4.5 stars. It loses the 0.5 star as I still think A Quiver Full Of Arrows outperforms it in terms of plot twists. Certain stories, however, such as 'The Grass Is Always Greener' show Archer to be capable of outperforming himself. All in all, this is one terrific book.",

Most of the stories are short, well-conceived and well-executed. The tale of two pub friends who trade off roles in their lawyer/expert witness routine is hilarious. In fact, Archer's droll wit is apparent on just about every page. I thought 3-4 of the stories were terrific, but even the &quot;sub-par&quot; ones I found enjoyable. I read the whole book in one sitting. Most readers of this kind of surprise short story should find these diabolically clever and suspenseful.

During the new romantic era of the 80's, Tony reached stardom as frontman for Spandau Ballet with his distinctive voice and adoring fans. But as the 80's were coming to a close so were Spandau Ballet. I was quite interested to see how Tony and guitar player Gary Kemp's friendship tunred sour and eventually landed in court over royalties. This book tells the story of how Tony had it all then lost it all.I was almost disillusioned to read how relentless Gary Kemp was in not only to stop paying royalites on Spandau Ballet's material, but to keep his former bandmates, Tony, John Keeble, and Steve Norman at bay not even allowing them to use the words &quot;ex-Spandau Ballet&quot; members during their tours. It was this conflict with Gary Kemp that caused Tony's downward spiral.But the book goes through the many highs and lows of Tony's life both in Spandau Ballet and in personal life, which kind of serves as a lesson for all of us. After reading this book, you will see that no matter what gets in your way of succees, or people that want to bring you down, or even if you make mistakes, don't ever give up on your dreams. Life is an adventure, take it day by day; that's Tony's philosopohy. I'm sure for all you diehard Spandau Ballet fans hoping to see a reunion sometime in the future, after reading this book, you will see that it will likely never happen.&quot;I know this much is True&quot;",

The stories were written to the reader. She'd be better off reading the companion book, His, which is written from the perspective of 30 different women to a male reader if she wants to read a book written from a woman's view point.) This book is absolutely unique. I haven't read another collection like it. The stories are exciting and erotic and very well written. Fantasies include having sex at a party, sex in a car, sex with an ex, outdoor escapades, sex with a coworker, and many more. The style of the stories is such that you can fall right into them.

One of my favorite stories is \" First Crossing\" by Pam Mun Ryan.\"First Crossing\" shows that it is not easy to cross the border to America. A boy named Marco and Papa try to cross the border to America to work. It might be Papas tenth time crossing the border, but for Marco it is his first crossing. One important phrase said by Papa was \"My future and the children's future are marked in stone here\". This is important because he is saying, in America there is a better life for him and his family.I did not like all of the stories in this book, but I would still recommend this book to anyone that wants to read stories about people trying to fit in.

Although initially, I had expected true stories of immigrants in a longer format, the stories in First Crossings are fictional and short.I enjoy reading multicultural fiction, and I throughly enjoyed reading some stories in the book, although after reading three to four stories, the stories began to become transparent and rather canned.I guess this is to be expected with a collection of stories all about the same subject, but I expected more from such prolific writers of the topic such as Lesley Namioka (whose books I have read before).Also missing from First Crossings is something that I think would be very relevant to current events in the United States, a story about illegal Mexican or Central American immigrants living in America, rather then just the immigration process.. Reading through the book, I found that it covered all manners and variety of immigration to America, with the glaring omission of this topic.To be more complete, I would recommend such a story be included. Otherwise, I have enjoyed reading from this book.A wide variety of topics related to immigration are presented in a sometimes humorous format, including the immigrant handling of cultural differences and misunderstandings, the customs and cuisine of a new country, and, especially valuable, the search for an identity as an immigrant in a new country, coming from a country with a distinct culture to another country with another distinct culture.The characters in the \"identity-related\"stories often struggle to find a balance between their birth and adopted cultures, and satisfyingly, appear to make adjustments and blend the two in unique ways.Although not what I expected, I enjoyed reading First Crossings.",

The information gathered within this book comes from old legends and folk stories that have circulated in Europe. There is a brief mention of other shapechangers, like were-leopards, -tigers and -bears, but the book clearly centers around \"werwolves\".Most of the information is given in the form of stories and legends, they are a very interesting read. As you read the stories, you can notice how most of the stories have a moral to them, in the same way as fairytales tend to have. You can almost imagine how these stories have been told in the dark to scare children and to teach them things like not to be too vain and proud.The book also contains some information on specific topics, like on how to become a werewolf, what is the spiritual side of them and if exorcism would work on a werewolf. The book has different chapters for some countries, including places such as Germany, Spain, British Isles, France and Finland.I highly recommend this book for those interested in the old were-legends.

Mr O'Donnell, by the way, is not an historian. He is a writer and spiritist. He states unequivocally that he believes in werewolves, and that he thinks they are formed by the evil spirits or elements that (in his opinion) also helped to create the world. His blend of shamanistic spiritism is big on imagination and short on facts. There's NOTHING about source material here. Not so much as one example. All the stories (very nicely written - there's no doubt about O'Donnell's ability to spin a good tale) are without attribution.The quotations Mr O'Donnell includes are notable for their lack of accuracy or the complete lack of existence of the works mentioned.This isn't what I expected. The information is incorrect, incomplete and based on Mr O'Donnell's personal beliefs. He doesn't provide any of the terrific sources available on this subject from the classics - it's just story after story after story after story...If I'd wanted a book called Tales of the Werewolf: A Collection of Chilling Stories by Elliott O'Donnell, I would have looked for that. I didn't want such a book - I wanted something that covered the primary sources of werewolves in documented history.Don't waste your time with this book unless a book of well-written fiction and a fair bit of blather about spiritism is what you're after.Definitely not recommended. I give this two stars for the effective writing style, but that's all.",

There are also many that are reminiscent of first drafts from a night-school creative writing class. When he's good, Keret is a fantastic new talent, full of humor and existential angst, but when he's not - he's trite, cliche, and boring - one more young guy writing about getting stoned and laid.The titular story \"The Nimrod Flipout\", is one of the best in the entire collection. Three young men are possessed, in turn, by the spirit of their friend, Nimrod, who killed himself after his girlfriend broke up with him. [Variety is also not Keret's strong suit. There are at least two other stories where someone kills themselves because they've been dumped.] After the narrator, the last to succumb to the spirit of his deceased friend, the possession repeats itself starting over again with Miron, the first to be possessed. It's a touching story about the frivolity of youth, and deeply tragic, as well; its also one of the funniest stories in the collection.\"Fatso\", the opening story, I also loved. It is about a guy whose girlfriend turns into a fat, drunk, soccer-loving man after the sun goes down, and how, after spending many nights going out and watching soccer at the bar with this character, he begins to love his girlfriend, too.This collection has its shining moments, and is highly recommended to fans of short fiction.

Often, these excellent stories elicited strong reactions from me, or made me smile at their strange, wonderful, and twisted genius. The first story of the book, \"Fatso,\" is such a gem of a story (in structure, in its strangeness, in style, in images, in character, in a surprising dose of magical realism) that, in addition to reading it four or five times, I'm also going to photocopy it, and send it to two friends. I think they'll find it excellent as well.Other stories are not nearly as good.But, after reading several of the other Amazon reviews of this book, I wonder: perhaps all of the stories are incredible, and some just appeal to different kinds of people from others. Several reviewers and readers seem to agree that this book has some excellent and some not-so-excellent stories, but do they all agree about which are which? I saw that at least one reviewer really appreciated the book's title story \"The Nimrod Flipout.\" But this was one of the stories with which I was thoroughly UN-impressed. It didn't move or excite me, and the writing didn't seem all that compelling. On the other hand, I absolutely loved \"Halibut\" - it is one of my favorite stories of all time. Each of the occurrences it describes is brilliantly timed, and the whole thing fits together in a brilliantly peculiar way. But, I wonder, did everyone else think that this story was excellent? I don't know.So maybe all of the stories are excellent, and some appeal to people like me, and others appeal to different people. It seems possible. I'd be curious to know what other people think.",

These tales sound so real your audience may not see them as fiction. Youths 11 to 15 years old, (the suggested age group) will believe them up to a point, and they will like them. Properly told, even an adult audience should find some meat this anthology. Although the book is marketed to Scout leaders in particular, these are not \"Scout\" stories for the most part. Your non-Scout youth group will like them.Besides the original stories created by the author, CAMPFIRE STORIES includes Forgey's masterful adaptations of uncommon vintage ghost stories penned by others, and even offers a true tale, \"Death of an Old Lion\" as told by Ernest Thompson Seton. Even a story by Mark Twain comes included. All of these stories are highly memorable, with entertaining, suspenseful plots. In \"The Valley of the Blue Mist,\" Forgey shares his version of this old story, which is found elsewhere under other names, but his is the best version I've yet seen.Only two of the stories out of the twenty were a disappointment: \"La Cucaracha Mine,\" a pointless, plotless hole, and \"The Indian Chief's Wait,\" which you will soon figure out is that familiar joke story, \"Falling Rocks\" in a poorly disguised form. The 5 stars are for the other eighteen \"must-have\" stories.At least the storytelling advice given in this book is practical and useful. Forgey includes a sequentially-numbered plot outline at the conclusion of each story, which I don't find necessary, but I'm certain many will find these most helpful. This book is a bargain!-Byron C.

Despite the title of the book, there are a smattering of female characters in some of the tales. They rank with the standard fare of impetuous women that Hemingway likes to write about.The scope of the stories is quite broad, featuring painful topics such as abortion, breakup, heartbreak and being past ones prime. The latter theme is taken up in THE UNDEFEATED, THE KILLERS and FIFTY GRAND and later on re-appears in Hemingway's THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA. FIFTY GRAND, which details the demise of a washed-up boxer, is my favorite short story in this collection.Stories such as IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, and NOW I LAY ME introduce motifs that are echoed in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, which was published just a few years after MWW.Tho I've never been enamoured with the short story genre, Hemingway does rank as one of the best in the business - particularly in the American literary canon.

The subject matter of interest-bullfighting, gangsters, bicycle racing, boxing and the effects of the ravages of war on the male psyche bear this out.In some of the short stories like A Canary For One where he introduces a forlorn woman and thus strays from the theme he is on less firm ground. And that kind of sums up the problem of the whole conception behind this compilation. Unlike Scott Fitzgerald, his contemporary and friend, who was very comfortable writing about women Hemingway does not show that same talent. The sparse, to the point dialogue we have come to expect from Hemingway gets its ususal full workout here but not a nuanced view of a two-gendered world.

Men Without Women is a collection of 14 (often quite short) short stories. His stories are often powerful, occasionally very moving, but the subject matter simply does not speak to me strongly.The two longest stories here are variation on a theme: a matador's last fight (\"The Undefeated\") and a boxer's last fight (\"Fifty Grand\"). Though both stories have a brutal honesty that I admire, neither the world of bullfighting (which comes up again in \"Banal Story\") nor the world of boxing is particularly interesting to me. Others, of course, who find these subjects more appealing than I would find more enjoyment here.Hemingway is often considered a writer for men (as even the title of this collection implies), and there is some truth to that. Not only is the subject matter more likely to appeal to men, but the characters about which he write are predominantly men. Sometimes, even so, this leads to some universally appealing results, like his hitmen story \"The Killers\" and his brush with homosexuality in war, \"A Simple Enquiry\". Ironically, however, the best of his stories are those that feature women: the abortion conversation in \"Hills Like White Elephants\", the veteran who loses his wife in \"In Another Country\", and the young man betrayed by his girlfriend in \"Ten Indians\". These are the stories I will remember from this collection.There is so much about Hemingway to like. His spare writing style and his ability to end a story quietly is wonderful. His willingness to tackle subjects like abortion, drug abuse, homosexuality, and the horrors of war is admirable. Without a doubt, some of the stories in this collection rise to the truly magnificent. To some, I'm sure, Hemingway is a perfect writer and I can see the appeal. I just wish the topic he chose to write about were more interesting to me.",

        "description": "Out of print for two decades, Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence, the explosive international best-seller, is back with a new foreword analyzing the unprecedented impact it had on the lesbian community and mainstream culture. In new afterwords, the co-editors reveal how the book came to be and what happened to their lives when, for the first time in history, a lesbian book from a small publisher went mainstream. Each nun in these stories describes her individual and searing path in, or out of, the convent to discover and face the truth of herself. Still myth-shattering, the stories remind us of the courage required to live-and love-in congruence with our authentic selves. \"Oblivious to the controversies that surrounded the initial publication of Lesbian Nuns: Breaking Silence, whether they originated within the Catholic Church or the lesbian feminist movement, thousands of readers across the decades have embraced the book and found their lives changed by its message of empowerment.\" - Joanne E.

There are too many stories in this book to just write these women off. If anything I think it is a sad but accurate portrayal of how often institionalized religion hurts and controls the people it is called to love. I never aspired to be a nun, but I have experienced both goodness and harm done in the name of religion.

                "review/text": "Forsyth is best known for his taut thrillers, especially The Day of Jackal, but this collection of short stories reveals him a very competent crafter of clever short stories. Originally written in the early to late '70s (and three of which appeared in Playboy), each of the ten tales is a mini-morality tale, with a lighthearted tone and a twist of some sort. Their unifying theme is revenge/comeuppance&oacute;each story is about someone getting their just desserts one way or another. The exception to this is \"Duty\", which is not light at all and quite different in theme and perspective, and for those reasons, feels wholly out of place.Two of the stories feature wealthy protagonists, including the title story, which tells of a handsome, successful English businessman who can have anything he wants from life and yet is still bored. It's the old \"money can't buy you happiness\" story, until one day he falls for a married woman. She admits the mutual attraction but won't leave her husband, and so the tycoon decides to send a hitman to solve the problem. The mechanics of the hitman's assignment are very compelling, and it all leads to an obvious twist that reaffirms the moral. \"A Careful Man\" is another rich man tale, but in this case, the wealthy coin dealer is dying of cancer and has no one he wants to leave his fortune to&oacute;least of all his detestable sister and her family. His solution is fairly clever and the fun is in watching the odious family catch up with what the reader already knows.Another set of stories feature unassuming hard-working middle-aged men who have yet to reap many fruits from their labors, and are generally married to unpleasant frigid nags. In \"The Emperor\", a bank manager vacations with his wife on a tropical island for the first (and probably last) time. It's basically the best experience of his life, and on the last day he quite daringly sneaks out for some sport fishing. This is transformative in a fairly predictable way, but satisfying nonetheless. In \"Money With Menaces\", an unassuming man comes across a \"swingers\" magazine on the train, and is intrigued by the idea of meeting a woman for sex. He falls right into an obvious blackmail scheme, but for once Forsyth hides the twist until the end, providing perhaps the best resolution of all the stories. \"Privilege\" starts with a small businessman who has been libeled in the newspaper and seeks redress. His lawyer dissuades him from suing, pointing out that winners of such suits usually incur huge financial costs that aren't worth the satisfaction of winning. Studying the libel statutes for a few days, he spots a possible form of redress. This story seems a little strange, as Britain has some of the harshest libel penalties in the Western world. \"Used in Evidence\" is about an old man who may or may not have killed his wife thirty years previously.Three of the stories are set in Ireland, a place Forsyth had a great personal interest in. \"There Are No Snakes In Ireland\" is a straight-out revenge tale, pitting a hard-working Indian student against his persecutor, a racist UVF thug. \"There Are Some Days&Ouml;\" is a comedy of errors about the heist of a truck of French brandy which goes completely pear-shaped. As in other stories, the reader knows more than the characters, and the pleasure comes in watching it all unfold. \"Sharp Practice\" takes place on a train, where a judge, priest, and humble worker pass the time with a friendly game of poker. Anyone who's knows a bit about con artistry will see the setup and likely result a mile away, but it's still good fun.All in all this is a very solid, if not spectacular set of stories. No doubt due to his journalistic background, Forsyth is great with the details of the stories, especially how people go about their work. His characters tend to be types rather than individuals, but for the kind of stories he tells, that's all you really need. As morality tales they are all set up and executed quite cleverly. And yet for all that, there's a kind of disposable element to them; none will make you sit up and say \"wow\".",

If you're already familiar with Forsyth, this is a collection of short stories similar to The Veteran. The stories in No Comebacks are shorter, usually about 20-30 pages each, ten in all. They are a little more lighthearted than the tone of Forsyth's novels, which are predominantly serious, and most involve an unexpected twist or turn along the way (sometimes saved for the very end). There's a story in here for everyone: a playboy in pursuit of a married woman, a victim of prejudice out for revenge, an answer to a mid-life crisis, a way to handle extortion, a response to a soiled reputation, and a unique way to settle an estate, to name a few.

He's got the talent for it, that's for sure.Any reader who appreciates good, crisp short stories will love every one of these by Forsyth. But maybe the audience for them has ebbed, too.

                "review/text": "Very few writers are equally good at both novels and short stories. I will not leave you in suspense - Frederick Forsyth is a better novelist. That is not a problem, however, as his novels are strong enough that he can dip a bit below that level and still be quite good. NO COMEBACKS demonstrates this.As one would expect from Forsyth, the stories in this collection often have either a violent or malicious undercurrent to them or explore the inner recesses of man's psyche. Many of the stories have a bit of a twist at the end, with some easy to see, others a bit harder, while still others appear to be apparent only to take a last minute swerve to somewhere else. My personal favorite is Money With Menace because it illustrates one of my favorite principles - you should not mess with someone even if he looks to be a sap because you never know when that other guy is tougher and nastier than you. The story Duty is out of place, which Forsyth acknowledges in a footnote. But as it is claimed to be true, I am glad it is included and the story did stay with me for a while after reading it.Forsyth unfortunately tends to be far too technical with some of his descriptions. Usually this is easily overlooked but becomes irritating in the story The Emperor with its details of fishing equipment. I suppose, however, that one does not earn Forsyth's reputation without an eye for detail and one cannot blame a man for showing it. Get the book to read a story or two between larger and heavier books and you will not be disappointed.",

Henry (except more dire, of course) where we learn something new about the character(s) that Forsyth had previously held back from us.I have yet to read any of Forsyth's novels but I keep going back to this collection time and time again, enjoying them as much as the first time (perhaps more now that I am older and can identify with them more).",
