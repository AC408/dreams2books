        "description": "Of all the lasting innovations that William Wordsworth (1770-1850) brought to our literature, it is his discovery of nature and his fresh vision of human lives in the context of nature that have most influenced our cultural climate. Here, collected in this volume, are Wordsworth's finest works, some of the most beautiful poems ever written: from the famous lyrical ballads, including \"The Tables Turned\" and \"Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey,\" to the sonnets and narrative poems, to excerpts from his magnum opus, The Preludes. By turning away from mythological subjects and artificial diction toward the life and language around him, Wordsworth acquired for poetry the strength and new sources of inspiration that have allowed it to survive and flourish in the modern world.",

                "review/text": "I was totally ignorant of Wallace Stevens until I came to Yale and took Professor Harold Bloom's course \"How to Read a Poem.\" American poetry, as I, a Chinese student of a non-English major, understood it, is Walt Whitman, T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. In contrast, Wallace Stevens's name was strange to most Chinese intellectuals till recently. Even in his native country his rise to a canonical status was not immediate. Eliot's The Waste Land and Stevens' Harmonium debuted around the same time, but the former took all the spotlight. A mysterious \"X\" recurs in some of Stevens's letters and poems. This \"X\" refers to no other than Eliot, which may reflect a degree of frustration on the part of Stevens. Not until his late years did Stevens slowly but surely receive the recognition he deserved. A lagging effect in cross-lingual translation and interpretation may explain Stevens's relative invisibility to the Chinese audience. In addition, Stevens, especially in his later years, was highly meditative and philosophical, at times difficult and obscure, which also affected his accessibility to foreign readers.Professor Bloom's class first initiated me into the force and beauty of Stevens's poetry. What intrigues me is that Stevens lived a double life. He was an insurance lawyer in profession and a poet in private, and seemed to have no difficulty alternating between the two seemingly incompatible roles. Just like his work is so original that they defy any easy label, Stevens's life is so eccentric that he contradicts the stereotype of what a poet is supposed to be like. This is particularly astonishing in the eyes of the Chinese, for in our tradition commerce and poetry have very little in common. Chinese poets are easily associated with scholars, officials, hermits, monks, artists, but it is hard to think of any example of successful poet-businessmen.I especially love \"The Poems of Our Climate,\" a short piece written in 1938, when the poet was 59 years old. It was a number of years on from \"The Idea of Order in the Key West.\" For Stevens, it was a central poem. Stevens's poetic odyssey spanning over half a century was punctuated by two puzzling breaks: in 1898-1900, Stevens, a Harvard student poet, contributed regularly to Harvard Advocate. After he left Cambridge for New York, his poetry writing stopped short. After a complete silence of seven years when Stevens was struggling with his business career, in 1907 he began to present love songs to his muse Elsie Moll, and his creative faculty seemed to return. In 1923, Stevens, at the age of 44, finally published his first volume of poems, Harmonium. The book's poor reception and its author's growing domestic and corporate responsibilities almost led him to abandon poetry again. For four years Stevens published little. Not until 1929 did Stevens resume poetry writing. Like the Irish poet W.B.Yeats and the Chinese poet Du Fu, the bulk of Stevens's best work was not done until his late years. Interestingly, these three literary lions unanimously fall in love with the fall season: Yeats admires the trees in their autumn beauty in \"The Wild Swans at Coole\"; Du Fu composed a cycle of regulated poems under the general title of \"Autumn Meditations\"; Stevens' last major poetic endeavor is no other than \"The Auroras of Autumn.\" These pieces actually reflect the poets' \"autumnal personality.\" As they are approaching that season of their life, their works become increasingly sophisticated, retrospective and sublime. The following lines from John Keats' \"Ode to Autumn\" might be particularly pertinent to their situations:Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,\"The Poems of Our Climate\" was written in this \"autumnal period\" of the poet's life, thus belonging to the poetry of maturity. It is in three numbered sections. There is a break between each of the sections.IClear water in a brilliant bowl,Pink and white carnations. The lightIn the room more like a snowy air,Reflecting snow. A newly-fallen snowAt the end of winter when afternoons return.Pink and white carnations - one desiresSo much more than that. The day itselfIs simplified: a bowl of white,Cold, a cold porcelain, low and round,With nothing more than the carnations there.Stevens's difficulty often lies in referentiality. The first section seems to have nothing to do with the title. There is no direct reference whatsoever to either \"poems\" or \"our climate.\" Ostensibly the poet-persona is watching a Japanese flower arrangement. Stevens had a passion for oriental arts and philosophies. He was a close reader of Okakura Kakuzo (1862-1913), and his library was full of all kinds of books about Japanese flower arrangement. He was not only deeply read in this subject, but also had a habit of ordering fresh flowers from shops. The opening sentence introduces the image of flower arrangement by creating a pleasing word picture of balance, harmony and form. \"Clear water\" seems to be redundant, yet this rhetorical excess emphasizes the crystalline transparency of water. \"Brilliant\" etymologically means \"to emit light, to reflect light,\" thus accentuating the shiny surface of the container. The combination of \"pink and white carnations\" brings a festival of inviting colors and textures that are traditionally associated with feminine innocence, charm and gentility. The origin of the word \"carnation\" in Latin confirms the connection between the flower and human flesh. Behind this image of sexual provocation is a male observer's voyeuristic and fetishistic desire. The first sentence sketches the key components of a flower arrangement (through three nouns: water, bowl and carnations), with an emphasis on their optical and chromatic effects in the eyes of a spectator (through four adjectives: clear, brilliant, pink and white), and thus anticipates the \"light\" in the following sentence. \"[...]. The light / in the room more like a snowy air, / Reflecting snow\" embraces and extends the aura around the flower arrangement: the interior light is not like snow falling, but rather like air reflecting fallen snow. The observer is so subtle that he cannot help but elaborating the snow image: during the winter the afternoons have been very brief; but now, with afternoons elongating, winter is near the end and somehow meets early spring, and a fresh snow lies immaculate on the ground, like a breathtaking artwork of Nature, which gives a pure, refreshing and ethereal tone to the air reflecting snow. This late-winter scene suggests that the observer, like \"the snowman,\" wants \"a mind of winter,\" but not a mind of deep winter. The light that gives luster to the flower arrangement, like the rainwater that glazes a red wheelbarrow (William Carlos Williams, \"A Red Wheelbarrow\"), works beautifully on both formal and metaphorical levels. It represents a natural light, but as part of an art world it also becomes an aesthetic light.So far the language is very pictorial, in the manner of a still life. When Stevens portrays an object, he often builds a simple yet powerful image, omitting all insignificant details. Therefore, his image is at once concrete and abstract, familiar and unfamiliar, and appropriately distances itself from reality. In the first stanza of \"The Poems of Our Climate,\" the image is very concrete and real: this is about a Japanese flower arrangement. Meanwhile, there is no extravagant description of the object, but a word picture almost in the style of a Chinese xieyi (\"to convey the spirit\") painting. It highlights the principal components of the flower arrangement (water, bowl and carnations), and throws away lesser details (such as the spatial disposition of flowers, the effect of foliage). The aesthetic atmosphere is not only created by the description of the object itself; it is also a product of the language. To use minimalism to achieve maximal effect - this is also the case for the language. The diction is basic English words, mostly monosyllabic and disyllabic. Stevens only suggests and expects the reader to complete the picture by himself.\"Pink and white carnations\" recurs verbatim in line 6, implying that the observer moves his meditative eyes back to the core image. Then the poem abruptly takes another direction: \"One desires / so much more than that.\" This jump from imagistic to argumentative language is visually strengthened with the use of a hyphen to connect a noun phrase and a full sentence. Meanwhile, \"desire\" corresponds to the etymological hint of carnation, and the whole question about desire will continue to inform the rest of the poem. \"The day\" is in opposition to whatever \"in the room,\" designating the world external to the flower arrangement. Thus \"[...] The day itself / is simplified\" suggests that art reduces the outside world. \"[...] a bowl of white, / Cold, a cold porcelain, low and round, / With nothing more than the carnations there.\" Once again, Stevens returns to visual imagery, but this is not a wanton repetition of the earlier lines, but rather a repetition with nuanced variations or a deliberate revision, as if the observer observes through a closer perspective. \"Cold, a cold porcelain, low and round\" introduces new details about the container and unmistakably echoes the \"cold pastoral\" in Keats's \"Ode on a Grecian Urn.\" While \"a bowl of white\" seems a neutral description of what is seen, the \"cold porcelain,\" just like Keats's cold urn, implies that this is a lifeless, artificial work. Although Stevens appreciates the aesthetic effect of the flower arrangement, subliminally he is not satisfied with its lifelessness and otherness to human world. He desires more: in the closure of the next stanza, he will repeat the word \"more\" thrice, where \"more\" becomes almost obsessive.Now, get back to the title. How to justify \"The Poems of Our Climate\"? There are poets whose titles are throwaways, but not Stevens. Stevens cares a great deal about titles. His titles are always precise and integral to his poems. The first stanza seems to totally leave out the title, yet on a deeper level flower arrangement is a metaphor for poem writing. Metaphor is not an ordinary association of one object with another, but a figuration or trope which suggests the essence of one object by identifying it with certain qualities of another. Like Whitman, Stevens has an amazing command of figuration. For him, metaphor is a powerful means through which imagination imposes order on reality. \"The Poems of Our Climate\" opens with an objective description of clear water, brilliant bowl, pink and white carnations, and snowy light. As the poet is projecting his imaginary magic on those things, they will go through a metamorphosis and become metaphorical references to poetry writing, for both are the objects of formal arrangement, and both use delicate minimalism to achieve elaborate effect. Because this transfiguring act of mind is rooted in an objective world, the aura of duality shines through the images: they are at once flower arrangement and poetry writing. Indeed, what makes this poem \"poetic\" is the dynamic shifting back and forth between the real object and the metaphorical meanings it prompts.IISay even that this complete simplicityStripped one of all one's torments, concealedThe evilly compounded, vital IAnd made it fresh in a world of white,A world of clear water, brilliant-edged,Still one would want more, one would need more,More than a world of white and snowy scents.Stevens desires \"complete simplicity,\" but such \"simplicity\" is a trope for reduction and deprives him of the necessary pain and suffering in writing a poem. The capitalistic \"I\" is arresting, since Stevens always uses the impersonal \"one\" (\"one\" occurs four times in this stanza and six times in the whole poem), yet here he says \"The evilly compounded, vital I.\" In \"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction,\" \"I\" stands out again: \"What am I to believe? ...\" There is rhetorical power in the Stevensian \"I,\" which is almost electrifying. It recalls Whitman's \"real me\" or \"me myself\" in \"Song of Myself,\" for all these terms suggest a self that is one's consciousness but is a deeper and unknown part of one's consciousness. Stevens was very evasive about Whitman, one of his prime precursors. He never had anything good to say about Whitman in prose. Actually he blamed Whitman for Whitman's tramp persona. Yet, as Harold Bloom observes, \"Whitman is a deeper and darker presence/absence in Stevens's work.\" Good poetry in any language always depends on allusiveness. This stanza echoes a couplet in \"Song of Myself\":Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me ...As self-contradictory as the Whitmanian \"real me\" or \"me myself,\" the Stevensian \"I\" is both \"evilly-compounded\" and \"vital\" (this word is never negative). Bloom unravels the paradox by arguing that \"The `Vital I' is compounded evilly only because it is compounded at all.\" In other words, Stevens is talking about a radical duality of self or even a plurality of selves, on which he will not give a stable judgment. \"Vital\" is also to find its compelling resonance in \"the never-resting mind\" in the succeeding stanza. A critic believes that Stevens's inward peering \"I\" also implies its externally seeing homophone \"eye.\" I agree with this insightful reading, for the whole poem is built upon the act of looking and seeing. \"Still one would want more, one would need more, / More than a world of white and snowy scents\" builds a crescendo of \"mores\" and reinforces the theme of desire. Stevens was from New Jersey and in his native language \"scents\" allegedly sounds like \"senses,\" so here he might be making another homonymic pun.In this stanza, \"a world of white\" recurs once more. This time, it is the word \"brilliant-edged\" that unfolds new information. The edge is between what two sides? Japanese flower arrangement draws materials from nature; meanwhile, it is cut and placed by people. Thus, it is a product of setting art against nature, so is poetry. The edge makes clear the dichotomy of art vs. nature. Fundamentally, high literature, especially poetry, is a continuous tradition. This poem explores a single motif that emerges again and again in a succession of strong poets - the relation between art and nature. Stevens is concerned with creating some shape of order in the wilderness and chaos of reality. On the other hand, he refuses to transform and harmonize reality at the cost of making violent imposition upon it. Shelley, in \"A Defense of Poetry,\" realizes that \"even the greatest poetry will, through time, become nothing more than signs for classes of thought, loosing its poetic edge as a result.\" To find the finer edge of words, Stevens urges us to get rid of the illusion of things and get to the truth. In Stevens's own words, \"the hum of thoughts evaded in the mind.\" (\"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction\")This stanza is syntactically distinguished from the other stanzas for a single sentence runs through all seven lines, creating an extended \"suspension system.\" The effect is to have the completion of meaning constantly delayed, and to make the delay a means of defamiliarizing the process of conferring meanings. \"Say even that,\" like \"more like\" in line 3, is an American idiom, meaning \"granted that.\" It introduces a concessive clause and distantly echoes the adverb \"still\" five lines later. This pair of connectives frames the whole sentence or stanza. While in the first stanza, imagery is the dominant device and noun structures prevail, this stanza is characterized by strong statements and powerful verbs. \"Stripped,\" \"concealed,\" \"made it fresh\" are positioned either at the beginning or the end of lines, and in sequence they make a set of structural parallels. This compels us to recognize their weight in the meaning-making process.IIIThere would still remain the never-resting mind,So that one would want to escape, come backTo what had been so long composed.The imperfect is our paradise.Note that, in this bitterness, delight,Since the imperfect is so hot in us,Lies in flawed words and stubborn sounds.If the last stanza closes with a litotes or an understatement in which one's desire is expressed by negating its opposite (\"a world of white and snowy scents\"), this stanza will directly address that keen desire of \"the never-resting mind\": \"one would want to escape, come back / To what had been so long composed.\" Again and again in this poem, Stevens plays upon opposition and apposition. We have encountered \"Stripped\" and \"concealed,\" \"evilly-compounded\" and \"vital\" before, and now the oxymoronic \"escape\" and \"come back to\" again force us to pause and think hard. \"What had been so long composed\" sounds like a Nietzschean cosmos, whose nut is hollow and lacking any purpose or unity. It also reminds us of the Shakespearean motto: \"This is an art, which does mend nature, change it rather, but the art itself is nature\" (Winter's Tale).\"The imperfect is our paradise\" invites multiple readings as well. The first thing comes to mind is the famous biblical allusion. Since the fall, Adam and Eve had been expelled from the perfect Eden and living in the far-from-perfect earth. So, from the start human beings are destined to accept imperfection as our living paradise. This sentence also echoes the Robert Browning quote \"A man's reach should exceed his grasp,\" suggesting that poetry writing is a tantalizing project. To achieve artistic perfection, one should attempt even those seemingly impossible things, despite all necessary pains and suffering. Moreover, \"imperfect\" in Latin means \"unfinished.\" By brings back the etymological meaning of \"imperfect,\" Stevens revisits the Whitmanian theme: \"Nothing is final, he chants. No man shall see the end.\"This imperfect world demands an imperfect language, that is to say \"flawed words and stubborn sounds.\" The closing sentence starts with an imperative expression \"Note that\" and takes on the tone of an academic lecture. The shift of pronouns from \"one\" or \"I\" to \"our\" or \"us\" strengthens this sense of reaching out to others. As the poem moves towards closure, it is getting more and more disturbing, and the reader can feel a profound malaise on the part of the poet. Again, \"bitterness\" and \"delight\" are set in opposition, suggesting a puzzling psychic construction. \"The imperfect is so hot in us\" means the desire for imperfection is so fierce in us. \"Hot\" is used to contrast the earlier \"cold\" (\"Cold, a cold porcelain\"), and both words can apply respectively to their core meaning and extended meaning. \"Lies\" is an even more intriguing polyseme: delight tells us untruth in flawed words and stubborn sounds, and also consists in such words and sounds. In \"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction,\" Stevens brings forward three fundamental functions of poetry: It Must Be Abstract; It Must Change; It Must Give Pleasure. So, he shares Shelley's view that joy is what poetry emanates from (\"A Defense of Poetry\"). Yet such a joy is achieved by flawed words and stubborn sounds, in other words, the stylistic eccentricity and strangeness in Stevens's word choice and his experiment with the musical quality of poetry.Finally, in what sense do we know Stevens? Stevens is a poet of profound subjectivity. He is always working on wordplays, suggestions and subtlety. He is endless. We go down and down and down, and cannot reach the bottom, and would still want more and need more. He carries us so deep into nature and art and their intricate interplay.",

                "review/text": "Wallace Stevens is one of those rare writers who had a golden touch with words -- musical words, spellbinding imagery, and no boundaries to keep anyone from enjoying it. \"The Palm at the End of the Mind : Selected Poems and a Play\" brings together many of his best works, starting early in his writing career and stretching through the years.Over his lifetime, Stevens wrote several books of poetry, but his exquisite poems are best taken by themselves: the languid splendour of \"Sunday Morning,\" the spare eloquence of \"Man With A Blue Guitar,\" and the hymnlike grandeur of \"Le Monocle De Mon Oncle.\" (\"I know no magic trees, no balmy boughs,/No silver-ruddy, gold-vermilion fruits./But, after all, I know a tree that bears/A semblance to the thing I have in mind.\")This volume also contains his little-known one-act play, \"Bowl, Cat and Broomstick.\" Like many of his non-poetic works, this play deals with the nature of poetry, and is in the form of a dialogue between three seventeenth-century characters. It's part parody, part analysis. And while it's a bit weird, it's certainly worth reading.Wallace Stevens began publishing poetry at an importance time in writing history, when the older styles were falling away. But instead of ignoring one type of poetry in favor of another, he took the best of all kinds -- his verse combines Victorian opulance with the more modern free-form verse.Though he isn't as well known as Yeats or Williams, Stevens' poetry is one of the few kinds that is both technically good and emotionally rich. His poetry can be whimsical (\"Every time the bucks went clattering/Over Oklahoma/A firecat bristled in the way\"), but it is also meditative and philosophical, even tackling the nature of reality.If nothing else, Stevens' writing can be read just because it is exquisitely beautiful. He lavished details all over almost every poem he wrote; his style tends to be a bit on the ornate side -- Stevens freely uses the more exotic terms -- such as \"opalescence,\" \"pendentives\" and \"muleteers\" -- wrapped up in complex verse, sometimes with a rhyme scheme and sometimes free-form.\"The Palm at the End of the Mind\" is a wonderful collection of Wallace Stevens' most significant long poems, his underrated play, and his equally important smaller ones. A must-have.",

The poems are a selection, not the author's complete works, and they are presented in the order in which they were written. I like the book for the way the poems are presented on the page, with lots of white space around them available for penciling in your own notes; that's something you are likely to do a lot of with Stevens' poetry. (Then changing your mind, erasing, and writing new notes...)But otherwise the Library of America volume is to be preferred, because it is complete, not a selection, and because the poems are organized by the successive books of poems Stevens published. That edition also contains letters and other ancillary material of interest. But the LOA volume also has very thin pages and little margin space for notations. So, I've got the LOA volume for reference and this \"Palm\" volume for notations. Works out pretty well, and between the the two you have just about everything.",

The style is fragmented, wonderfully epigramatic, and is in a dozen or so different voices, some of them plain-spoken, some learned, some holy, many pushing the limits of sanity. The \"notes\" in the bottle don't come from one source, but seem to be drawn from countless forgotten sources. Codexes, conquest narratives, treatices on alchemy and the occult, the private thoughts of the long forgotten.I have no idea how much is invention and how much the fruit of research, but it doesn't matter. The effect of his style is like being lowered into a cavern of glittering artifacts; although rather than precious metal, these shards are made up of emotional and intellectual gold.One of my favorite, repeated (chanted?) phrases in the book has become a kind of motto for me -- almost impossible to live up to, but great to attempt: \"Pass by that which you do not love.\"When I work up the nerve, I'll get it tattooed on my arm.

                "review/text": "Robert Hass's fourth book of poetry, \"Sun Under Wood,\" shows where he's travelled from since 1979's \"Praise.\" In this book, he's sedate and contemplative, looking at nature and relationships with the air of a man who has mellowed with time. Beautiful and sensitive, this lacks the passion of \"Praise,\" but has a mellow charm of its own.Hass ponders his childhood, and the childhood of the US: visions of the Franciscan priests coming to California, and bringing illness with them -- \"They meant so well, she said, and such a terrible thing/came here with their love...\" He looks back on his mother, on his father's death, and his bond with his brother in college. Not to mention \"Sonnet,\" as a man listens lovingly to his ex-wife's voice.But don't think that Hass only contemplates family. He also fixes his eye on nature -- weather, plants, animals, mountains, and the almost magical web that surrounds them in his writing. Even when writing a gritty piece on an airstrip, \"Layover,\" he pauses to describe the \"snowy mountains,\" \"moose feeding along the frozen streams/snow foxes hunting ptarmigans...\" His infatuation with nature peaks in the exquisite \"Woods in New Jersey,\" and the dreamlike \"Iowa City: Early April.\"Good poets are remembered, while mediocre ones are usually forgotten quickly. Robert Hass is one of the former. His descriptions of love, loss and nature are striking and beautiful, and in that \"Sun Under Wood\" is not a change. It's an evolution -- rather than the fire and passion of his earlier works, this is a quieter, meditative collection.The peak of his writing in \"Sun Under Wood\" is \"English: An Ode,\" an apparent tribute to the power of words. It seems fragmented even for free-style poetry, but as it's read it makes more and more sense -- it explores words, their roots, their meanings, and their evocations, only to end on a distinctly romantic note. It also seems quite appropriate, since his poetry is so evocative. Without having to use dramatic words, Hass brings to mind snowy woods, noisy tarmacs, a tearful eye or a creek fringed by fronds.Hass's writing has changed over time, and \"Sun Under Wood\" is a polished, contemplative collection of beautiful poetry. Highly recommended.",

                "review/text": "In this book, Robert Hass treads close along the confessional risk line but never quite seems to slip over it. This avoidance is tricky, given the highly personal material in most poems here. (I'd define the CRL as the point at which a poet fails to generate sympathy in the reader when discussing what is posed as personal pain - truly autobiographical or not.) He manages not to trip up by the masterful use of several strategies:1. Distraction: when approaching the kernel of pain in a poem, he mouths around it, noting with palpable wonder the beauty and strangeness of the natural world before returning to the kernel for another little gnaw. Eventually acceptance - not so much resolution, which is hard to find in this book - is the reward of rationed philosophical nibbling. In poem after poem, Nature is a necessary source of healing distraction, and occasionally so are the imagined lives of other people. What's implicit is a deep sense of trust in the process of healing, which requires time and attention, but not necessarily to the pain.2. Fluidity: structural as well as tonal. Distracting himself and the reader when things start to sting could very well make for clunky, ungenerous verse, but his casual tone (which rarely if ever asks for pity, instead lingering over what excites his curiosity) somehow brings us along willingly. Even when the interruptions are overt (\"Interrupted Meditation\", \"Regalia for a Black Hat Dancer\"), he doesn't derail. Perhaps this is because the reader has been coaxed into accepting Hass's constant shuttle between private musing and scrupulous description by3. Beautiful, accurate language: Hass has a fine eye, and a fine ear to match. \"dragonback of pine\", \"toss off grails of pure white idly\" - the book sings often enough to singlehandedly justify the reader's attention. It's nice that Hass mostly refrains from simply treating his natural materials as springboards for hokey or artificial metaphors - as the old man says in \"Interrupted Meditation\", Hass doesn't excel at metaphor - but he does excel at bringing non-human life to vivid presence on the page.This book is largely about overcoming pain - not in the sense of triumph, but in the sense of swallowing, ingesting, receiving, and transforming. The ideas aren't all that big - just big enough to be useful and pleasurable. As Hass navigates his sorrow, we're glad he invited us along.",

More personal opinion: As I read Sun Under Wood, I had to set it down every few minutes to jot down notes for other projects because it's one of those books that set the gears in your head all spinning away toward different ends. A good thing when you need to write.Lyrical, fluid, spot-on. A small prize.\"A Reader\" says this is \"More nature stuff,\" and I always get bristly when I hear that. \"More nature stuff\" sounds a bit reductive and condescending, don't you think? \"A Reader\" goes on to say that Hass \"seems more resigned than before as to what life brings and is not fighting for happiness.\" Well. I don't think that writing a book of poems qualifies as resignation.\"I had the idea that the world's so full of pain / it must sometimes make a kind of singing. / And that the sequence helps, as much as order helps-- / First an ego, and then pain, and then the singing.\"",

There is no resignation or distance in the work, it is deeply intimate and passionate. However, it is decidedly lacking in the immature rebellion against human reality. That rebellion relies on dualistic constructions: good experience vs. bad experience, good vs. evil, etc. Nature, of which humanity IS, can provide all the examples for finding our place in our world, no matter the pleasure or displeasure of our daily experiences. \"nature stuff\"--the very expression is absurd, its flavor indicative of the disconnection humankind lives with by choice.This book is simply wonderful, cover to cover. Hass creates a long ignored need for peaceful contemplation of the common ignorance of the richness of life we move too quickly past, discard and unconsciously dismiss as unimportant.Amazing imagery, flowing rhythm, new and precise 'witnessing' of nature and nature's meaning along with human sorrow. It gets uncomfortable, the way great poetry should, and yet Hass resolves the 'disenchantment' is very beautiful ways.Highly recommended.",

        "description": "Using information from the cutting edge of modern science, Peake presents startling evidence that the inner worlds of our mystics and shamans are as real, or possibly even more real, than the reality we experience in waking life. As his starting point, Peake examines the widespread historical belief that the mid-brain's pine-cone shaped pineal gland activates the third eye described by mystics and seers. Through careful analysis of ancient religious texts and artifacts, he gives evidence that the spiritual properties of the pineal gland have been embedded in myths and cultures across the globe. (Why else would the Buddha so often be found wearing a pine cone hat?) Peake then shows that it is through this small organ that we experience lucid dreaming, out-of-body experiences, hypnagogic imagery, near-death experiences, astral travel and the kundalini experience. The book ends with the mind-blowing conclusion that all living beings are one unitary consciousness experiencing itself subjectively.",

Some of his lines are the definition of pure poetry.

Ginsberg frequently writes about different Hindu gods and goddesses, reflecting his deep interest in and knowledge of Indian culture. There are a series of photographs that compliment the written words very well; as opposed to the original printing of this book, there are several new photographs included.

                "review/text": "While discussing Stanley Burnshaw's 'The Seamless Web', Guy Davenport summed up exactly how I felt after reading 'The Geography of the Imagination'. \"It is like being in the room with a charmingly intelligent man who has found a big subject in several hundred books. He attacks the subject this way, that way, pointing out this astuteness and that perception, all the while taking down book after book and reading the relevant passage. Having heard him to the end, you are still a bit puzzled as to how you might condense it all for its coherence and thrust, but you are aware that it is an important discussion you've heard.\"The 'coherence and thrust' is quite plain - the problem is that 'The Geography of the Imagination' begins just shy of where my education ends, and then shoots upward, stratospherically, from there. Whereas I thought I knew something about the humanities and their historical perspective, I was astonished at how limited my fractional knowledge really was, and how ably Mr. Davenport exposed my boundaries by linking modern, often unappreciated, masterworks to the classical past in ways I would never have seen unassisted.That's the thrust - modern literature and poetry and art and even music and architecture peeled back layer by layer to uncover their links to antiquity - and how those allusions to the past skip over the present's community conscious like a flat rock across a shallow creek. I may see something in these works that resonates, but I don't know why, or else only dimly recognize the references. Guy Davenport, on the other hand, zips back and forth between the ages, then laterally across genres and mediums, teasing out parallels and themes between such strange bedfellows as, for example, Poe, Grant Wood, and the myth of Persephone, sure-handedly leading the reader through a byzantine maze of arcana and out into fuller perspectives.At times I wonder if Mr. Davenport hasn't read too much into his subjects - could these artists and writers have purposely added *all* that he sees in their work? It doesn't matter, because there are plenty of other connections that ring true, and the point isn't so much whether the artists were aware of it as that, with the trained eye (or guided, as I was by the author), it's possible to recognize and appreciate the subtleties permeating their art. However, Mr. Davenport also makes it clear that the people he writes about absolutely intended for most of these allusions to be there. For instance, when he delves into poetry, I was simply astounded at the precise and compact ordering of words and myth and oblique references by the masters. It's like a coded text, an intuited lingua franca for people who meet at the non-Euclidean borders of dreams and the subconscious.While Mr. Davenport makes a strong case for the poets he believes in, poetry, for me, is only a slight interest, and I think it's important to note that the book's first half is almost exclusively about poets and their work. These are poets (Pound, Zukofsky, Marianne Moore, Charles Olson, Jonathan Williams and Ronald Johnson, among others) and their poems that the author expects us to be quite familiar with already, and honestly, many of these sections were over my head. Still, I value quite highly the introduction to the concepts behind this type of poetry, and to the other subjects also, as an extension to an incomplete education.Other highlights are sections on Eudora Welty, James Joyce, Osip Mandelstam (who was previously unknown to me), and anecdotal essays concerning Joyce Kilmer, Wittgenstein, Charles Ives, and Shelley's Ozymandias. Except describing any particular essay of Mr. Davenport's as limited to one person misses the point entirely. In the imagination's geography, every country shares a border and a history, and, as the author demonstrates, it is impossible to write about one without examining the others. And even if much of the territory is terra incognito for me, his demanding and un-condescending essays are perfect launching pads for further explorations.",

Pound's Cantos? and he moves without hesitation to a philosopher widely viewed as extremely eccentric and hard to understand: Wittgenstein. To put it in another way, if YOU can't make head or tail of someone, you're likely to find that someone on Davenport's list of favorites.But when he flies closer to earth (\"closer to the understanding of mere mortals\") he has some of his best moments, in my opinion. His chapter on Whitman is really excellent, although you may find his insistence that the internal combustion engine has made life dull a bit of a stretcher.

A dramatic, moving collection; each poem has a gripping personal story to tell. \"Daphne, Older\": Peel back my skin: / reveal hard fibers, bite marks, // scars from wind and rain. / Life is pain - I won't tell you // any different. Just that sometimes, / avoiding what you fear // isn't the answer. See? All these years / my branches sang with birds // and my leaves drank sunlight- / I haven't missed much. // My heartwood hardens slowly / over time - first, to the music, then, to the light.",

Her voice rings clear as a bell in this collection and I can't wait to see what she's got next.She could be a Billy Collins for the younger women in contemporary America who have already traced the roots of their power back to Suffrage and see that feminism isn't just about bra-burning and symbology, but about using what our mothers gave us: voices, brains, and mettle.I'm inspired.",

Viggo Mortensen wears plenty of different hats as an artist. \"Coincidence of Memory\" collects assorted poetry, paintings and photographs ranging from the late 1970s to 2002. Whenever they are from and whatever they are, his creations are vivid and very striking.In both his visual and literary art, Mortensen shows a sort of evocative simplicity. His poetry can bring to mind very powerful emotions that are left up to us to imagine (\"Tried to say something/that filled my mouth/and longed to rest/in your ear/Don't dare write/it down for fear it'll/become words, just/words...\"). He can also bring to mind simpler, more everyday things like arguments, frozen roads and observing the changes in nature.His photography has the delicacy of a painting, with skilful use of light and color -- and the paintings are even better. For example, one is a simple shot of a mossy tree trunk surrounded by dry grass; another is of a leafless tree reflected in a car hood, and yet another is a darkly-lit picture of some little plants on the ground. Most striking is a photograph of electrical cables \"intruding\" on a grassy spot.There's an intimate, capture-the-moment feel to Mortensen's photographs, as if you can see these things through his eyes for a moment. The paintings are just as good, such as \"Self-Portrait, April\". It's a picture of Mortensen's lips and chin, with all other featured obscured by a collage-like swirl of hazy artwork. The paintings are definitely absorbing, even if you don't understand the story behind them.Viggo Mortensen's evocative, thoughtful artwork is shown in three different forms -- poetry, photographs and paintings -- in the beautiful \"Coincidence of Memory.\" A haunting, remarkable collection of Mortensen's work.",

It is often off-the-wall topics. My favorite is Keepsake about a letter opener. The poems are philosophical and definitely not ordinary. Other favorites are Communion-about a relationship and Edit-how one's work is reduced to a movie with the theater its grave.He likes to catch subjects in motion in photographs. Often they are blurred or have light coming in them as if someone opened up the door to the darkroom. They are skillful and interesting.His paintings (which are abstract) are surprisingly good.

It is a book that can be displayed and shared with friends or picked up in the need of some tranquil and thought provoking times. By reading the poems, verses and viewing the images created both through photography and paintings with much diversified mediums and imagery you are taken on a journey of creativity. The cover of the book drew me to it, as it brought me back to my own childhood when my parents used to take me to \"El Retiro\" a beautiful park in Madrid, Spain. The picture captured those feelings of peace and happiness of long ago and brought them to the present. That interpretation is what art photography is about, capturing an image in the physical and transferring it to feelings of the heart. Viggo exemplifies so many creative people's dreams and goals that you can be successful in doing a multitude of endeavors. He serves as a mentor to the creative mind and this book typifies that conviction. It is clear from immersing one self in this book that the author has acquired much wisdom, knowledge and deep seated feelings through travel and being exposed to different cultures at a young age.

Emily Dickinson puts poets above the sun and God in pantheon of what's most important, and people like Raymond Carver prove her right. Although this last offering by the 20th century's greatest minimalist writer is neither his greatest nor his most minimal, it strikes the same generous chord of longing, of heart warming simplicity and heart breaking honesty, that Carver strikes elsewhere. The style is the man, wrote Buffon (in French), and sure enough that is the case here: a style of simple emotional honesty, combined with an artist's experimental will to playfulness, sufffused with a hope whose transcendent beauty is precisely its distillation from the undoctored elements of ordinary reality. This book, enhanced and completed by Tess Gallagher's wonderfully loving but unsentimental introduction, shows Carver at the end of his life; still excited about art, and the possibility of the poem form, he splices lines from Chekov stories, giving them titles and therebytransforming them into poem epigraphs to his own measured prose. The transformation of the Chekov short story to the Carver poem perhaps underscores the poetic process itself, whittling down reality into its artistic essence--the process so aptly demonstrated by Carver, who never wrote a novel, in his short stories. As Salmon Rushdie says on the cover (I paraphrase), read this book by Carver. Read everything by Carver. Raymond Carver was a great writer.",

It was put together with the help of the love and companion of the last eleven years of his life, the writer Tess Gallagher.

His poems are often stories built around direct observations or statements of his present mood, a mood that is also reflective on other times of life. The poems which I believe are most moving often have to do with relationships, with his father, with his former wife, with his children.His world is often a disordered and painful one, the alcoholic's world , the world of those in debt and down. But there is in him almost always a redemptive appreciation of life, a certain hidden joy and emotional surprise which gives the poems their special life.Among the beautiful poems of this work is one called 'Cherish' in which he tells of the tenderness in his relationship with Tess Gallagher.I was very moved by the last poem , a fragment that sums up the man and the redemptive power of his work.LATE FRAGMENTAnd did you get whatyou wanted from this life, even so?I did.And what did you want?To call myself beloved, to feel myselfbeloved on the earth.",

He is very much interested in what it means to be an artist and a black man. In his first collection, Muscular Music, he took the reader through a living library of cultural icons, from Shaft and Fat Albert to John Coltrane and Miles Davis. His second collection, Hip Logic, continued these explorations of popular culture, fatherhood, cultural heritage, and loss. Wind in a Box, Hayes's resonant new collection, continues his interest in how traditions (of poetry and culture alike) can be simultaneously upended and embraced. The struggle for freedom (the wind) within containment (the box) is the unifying motif as Hayes explores how identity is shaped by race, heritage, and spirituality. This new book displays not only what the Los Angeles Times calls the range of a \"bold virtuoso,\" but also the imaginative fervor of a poet in love with poetry.",

        "description": "Until recently, Iranian literature has overwhelmingly been the domain of men. But the new hybrid culture of diaspora Iranians has produced a prolific literature by women that reflects a unique perspective and voice. Let Me Tell You Where I've Been is an extensive collection of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction by women whose lives have been shaped and influenced by Iran's recent history, exile, immigration and the formation of new cultural identities in the United States and Europe. These writings represent an emerging and multi-cultural female sensibility. Unlike many flat media portrayals of Iranian women-as veiled, silenced-these writers offer a complex literary view of Iranian culture and its influences. These writers interrogate, challenge, and re-define notions of home and language and their work offers readers an experience of Iranian diaspora culture. Featuring over one hundred selections (two-thirds of which have never been published before) by more than fifty contributors--including such well-known writers as Gelareh Asayesh, Tara Bahrampour, Firoozeh Dumas, Roya Hakakian and Mimi Khalvati--the collection represents a substantial diversity of voices in this multicultural community. Divided into six sections, the book's themes of exile, family, culture resistance, and love, create a rich and textured view of the Iranian diaspora. The poems, short stories, and essays are suggestive of an important conversation about Iran, Iranian culture, the Persian and English languages, and the dual identities of many of its authors. This powerful collection is a tribute to the wisdom, insight, and sensitivity of women attempting to invent and articulate a literature of in-betweenness.",

A voyage that was carried despite significant prejudice and eradication of an assortment of their basic rights. It is also a narrative of the immigration experience, being subjected to intolerance and narrow-mindedness on a different level and yet succeeding despite the odds. These incredible women are telling their story and the story of all of us who experience conflict, affection, separation, contradictions and intolerance, while struggling to maintain a conventional existence. A lesson for all of us in improved comprehension of one-another and recognizing the value of our differences. Highly recommended!",

Revealing unique outlooks in a formerly male dominated, patriarchal literary tradition, these vivid works of poetry, fiction and nonfiction give authentic artistic voice to the silence of the veil stereotype frequently perceived by the West. Over one hundred selections are presented by more than fifty authors, some famous and some unknown. Two thirds of the works are previously unpublished. The authors selected are a diverse group who represent a cross section, or a complex community of intelligent, sensitive, articulate women in a rapidly changing world. The voices of these writers have been named \"Allegories of our enriched nation... the real thing,\" by Zohreh T. Sullivan, author of \"Exiled Memories: Stories of the Iranian Diaspora.\" A list of the contributors include Tara Bahrampour, Susan Atefat-Peckham, Firoozeh Dumas, Farnoosh Moshiri, Azadeh Moaveni, and other less familiar writers such as Leyla Momeny, Gelareh Asayesh, Niloofar Kalaam, and Farnaz Fatemi. Certainly many kudos are owed to Professor Persis Karim, teacher of English and comparative literature at San Jose State University, for amassing this wondrous, stunning collection. The selections are organized by theme into six different main areas: Home Stories, For Tradition, Woman's Duty, Axis of Evil, Beyond, and Tales Left Untold Subjects include differentiating dual and multi-cultural identities, sexuality, love, traditional expectation and its failure, politics, gender, blood and suffering, and the desperate poignancy of silence. There is so much to absorb in this collection, it is so very rich. It is certainly a fragrant beginning to enable Western to grasp the barest outlines of the complexity and courage of these women and their worlds and cultures. It is impossible to read any part of this book and come away unchanged. \"But she wants to step into/the whiteness of this inferno/and search Madison/for someone in his life/with the power to change him:/daughter, father, wife./She would become that person/undress him in the daytime/stand naked in front of him./say, look at what we've wrapped in./See this soft scraped creamy dark thing?

This isn't a book only for Iranians, it is for anyone wanting to be immersed in well-told stories and conveyance of emotions and life's happenings.",

This is a beautiful book--nice, heavy, slick pages, wonderful photographs, and the poems are laid out in a way that invites the eye to linger. Lax's poems are stil spare, and these are interesting in that they are long exercises in peeling apart the poet's own life and consciousness. They're more like his \"21 pages\" and journal entries than the short \"Fables\" or even the long, abstract island poems--yet still retain his trademark short broken syllable style. And for this reason, they're very involving. You feel closer to the center of Lax's world than ever before, as if you're invading his private world, sitting in his bedroom late at night watching as he whittles away at himself with words. Also included are several essays, one detailing Lax's final trip home, an interview (as I recall), and some other miscellaneous essays. Whether you love the poetry or loved the man himself, or both, this is necessary reading.",

This museum quality publication pleasures the senses, as well as the mind. Brought into the quiet, serene world of Robert Lax, living on a remote Greek island, one feels the hectic turmoil of life slip away.Black and white photography present an old man, lover of cats, who lived in a small room, bed in one corner, \"study\" in another, table, sofa and chairs in another. Living a simple, hermit life, this writer gave up the modern dream of accumulating fame and fortune. Lax attempted to bring attention and love to the world every moment of every day.This poet's slowed down, minimalist style intrigued Europeans long before his fellow Americans. The extremely focused, train of thought poetry will not attract those looking for a \"quick read\" or lovely nature poetry. But for those of a more contemplative bent, \"Robert Lax\" is a delicious meal to be savored.",

        "description": "In his illuminated books,William Blake combined his handwritten text with his exuberant imagery on pages the like of which had not been seen since the great decorated books of the Middle Ages. To read such books as Jerusalem, America and Songs of Innocence and of Experience in cold letterpress bears no comparison to seeing and reading them as Blake conceived them, infused with his sublime and exhilarating colours. At times tiny figures and forms dance among the lines of the text, flames appear to burn up the page, and dense passages of Biblical-sounding text are brought to a jarring halt by startling images of death, destruction and liberation. This edition, produced together with The William Blake Trust, contains all the pages of Blakes twenty or so illuminated books reproduced in true size, an appendix with all Blakes text set in type and an introduction by the noted Blake scholar, David Bindman. They can at last become part of the lives of all lovers of art and poetry.",

The words literally flow, twine, blossom in vivid & startling color, woven into the intricate, symbolic artwork. There aren't enough superlatives for this edition, which enables everyone to finally see & feel the Universe as Blake did: ablaze with power, wonder, beauty, horrors, and the godlike beings of the human psyche, titantic aspects transcending any neat, pre-packaged psychological or symbolic labels. For anyone wanting insight into the soul of Western civilization over the past few centuries, the soul in which we all struggle to find meaning & purpose now, this volume is absolutely essential. Most highly recommended!",

                "review/text": "Valuable things are not easy; easy things are not valuable. I don't know if that's a quotation from the Tao-Te Ching, but it ought to be. William Blake's longer poems, the so-called Prophetic Books, are legendary in their difficulty. Each of the two great epics, \"Milton\" and \"Jerusalem\", is a world in itself, taking years or decades to explore. Everyone who has made the effort considers it time well spent.Blake wasn't shy about the importance of his own work. In a letter he described \"Milton\" as \"the Grandest Poem this World Contains\". But these immense, unique hand-engraved, hand-coloured cosmic-spiritual epics found no buyers in Blake's own lifetime. Only one coloured copy of \"Jerusalem\" is known to exist.The Illuminated Books have been reproduced in colour before, but this is the first time all the plates have been printed full-size in a single book. Blake is fascinating even in black-and-white, but to read these books in the form intended means entering a new world. By depicting spiritual principles as People, Blake shows us the meaning of all ancient gods.After the lyrics of the \"Songs of Innocence and \"Songs of Experience\", the best place to start is the \"Book of Thel\", then the \"Visions of the Daughters of Albion\". When reading the long books, a plain text copy of the \"Complete Poems\" will come in handy: difficulty in reading Blake's graceful orange script for \"Jerusalem\" may be one difficulty too many. The remaining shorter books, with their anguished mythical narratives, rely more than the others on their illustrations, printed as if with fire, rust and soot: images of an age of Revolution.Blake's aim was nothing less than \"to open the immortal Eyes/ Of Man into the Worlds of Thought, into Eternity/ Ever expanding in the Bosom of God, the Human Imagination\". Astonishingly this is not exaggeration nor plain craziness: he can actually do this.If a book I admire gets five stars, this one deserves fifteen. It's a marvel, a rectangular treasure, one of the most precious books ever printed.",

He hand-wrote all the text in his books and, while beautiful in its own right, my myopic little eyes have a hard time sussing out the actual words. The editors of this book helpfully include a type-written transcript of his poetry and prose... at the back of the book. There are a few pages where the text is transcripted onto the page below the original copy, but I feel that it should have been done for most of the book, since the \"actual size\" images leave a lot of white space that isn't utilized. Also, and this has nothing to do with the book itself, I didn't do enough research as to the contents, but there aren't any of his stand-alone paintings or his illustrations for \"The Divine Comedy.\" This is certainly a comprehensive book, just not what I was looking for.",

        "description": "Originally produced in 1793, Visions of the Daughters of Albion has become one of Blake's most widely read and interpreted prophecies. The main character is a liberation figure challenging not only male chauvinism and marriage but the institution of slavery and imperialism in general. The female protagonist Oothoon, a sex slave who is raped by the slave driver Bromion, is clearly made to represent both the fertile, virginal and innocent lands of the pre-colonialism New World and the oppression of the women of Blake's time, who were, like slaves, treated as property of their husbands. In the course of his poem Oothoon becomes the ultimate symbol for liberation both as a woman and as a slave. William Blake (1757 - 1827) was a British poet, painter, visionary mystic, and engraver, who illustrated and printed his own books. Blake proclaimed the supremacy of the imagination over the rationalism and materialism of the 18th-century. Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of both the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age.",

In Refusing Heaven, Gilbert writes compellingly about the commingled passion, loneliness, and sometimes surprising happiness of a life spent in luminous understanding of his own blessings and shortcomings: \"The days and nights wasted . . . Long hot afternoons / watching ants while the cicadas railed / in the Chinese elm about the brevity of life.\" Time slows down in these poems, as Gilbert creates an aura of curiosity and wonder at the fact of existence itself. Despite powerful intermittent griefs-over the women he has parted from or the one lost to cancer (an experience he captures with intimate precision)-Gilbert's choice in this volume is to \"refuse heaven.\" He prefers this life, with its struggle and alienation and delight, to any paradise. His work is both a rebellious assertion of the call to clarity and a profound affirmation of the world in all its aspects. It braces the reader in its humanity and heart.",

That she wasold enough to know better. But anythingworth doing is worth doing badly.Like being there by that summer oceanon the other side of the island whilelove was fading out of her, the starsburning so extravagantly those nights thatanyone could tell you they would never last.Every morning she was asleep in my bedlike a visitation, the gentleness in herlike antelope standing in the dawn mist.Each afternoon I watched her coming backthrough the hot stony field after swimming,the sea light behind her and the huge skyon the other side of that. Listened to herwhile we ate lunch. How can they saythe marriage failed? Like the people whocame back from Provence (when it was Provence)and said it was pretty but the food was greasy.I believe Icarus was not failing as he fell,but just coming to the end of his triumph.I've read some women critics who are first bothered by his focus on women, as if he used them as stepping stones to God. Most don't. Gilbert's a little like Robert Graves, who found women in all their humanity the heart of a heartless world. He's a poet of sharp-eyed praise. Read him: he may be the last great poet.",

Without a doubt, this is one of the finest books of poetry I've ever read, maybe the finest. Each poem is lyrical and elegant - complete in its own right - but the collection also works as a whole. The poems are spare, and for the most part, sad, speaking to love and loss, life, letting go, and holding on. They are classical subjects of poetry, and they manage here, to be both intimate - a seemingly autobiographical look into the author's emotional life - and universal. And somehow, too, they manage to be timeless and vast in their appeal: accessible, I think, to a casual reader of poetry, and yet equally rich for a student of the traditional forms. I devoured this book, reading it in a single sitting lasting late into the night. And then the next day, when I awoke, I read it again. That was a month ago, but the images linger: life altering and life affirming, the essence of great poetry.",

                "review/text": "Jack Gilbert is an uneven poet, wonderful at his imagistic best, talky and preachy at his abstract worst. The chief flaw of this 92-page volume is that it contains far too many poems. Without the clutter of the so-so pieces, this could be a lean and elegant book, more in keeping with the poet's ability to \"flower by tightening.\" He deserves better editing; after all, he is an important voice in American poetry, an extremely ambitious poet who tries to marry wisdom with beauty. Who else would dare conclude a poem with this statement -To hear the faint sound of oars in the silence as the rowboatcomes slowly out and then goes back is truly worthall the years of sorrow that are to come.Gilbert's unique strength is use of the imagination, his ability to interweave the mental realm with realistic details. \"Bring in the Gods\" and \"The End of Paradise\" are among the Top Five here, as is \"What Song Should We Sing.\" Another interesting poem is \"Trouble,\" with its startling ending that blurs the boundary between reality and imagination. \"The Lost Hotels of Paris,\" \"A Thanksgiving Dance,\" and \"Burma\" are also among my favorites, along with \"Seen from Above\" and \"The Garden,\" which begins,We come from a deep forest of yearsinto a valley of an unknown countrycalled loneliness. Without horse or dog,the heavens bottomless overhead.We are like Marco Polo who came backwith jewels hidden in the seams of his ragged clothes.The opening of \"Moreover\" is simply extraordinary:We are given the trees so we can knowwhat God looks like. And riversso we might understand Him. We are allowedwomen so we can get into bed with the Lord,however partial and momentary that is.The passion, and then we are single againwhile the dark goes on.Often, however, I like only parts of certain poems, and I wonder if we could have \"fragments of Jack Gilbert\" the way we have fragments of Sappho - for some poems, it would be a huge improvement. On page 30, for instance, embedded in an otherwise almost unbearable poem, with the unbearable title \"'Tis Here! `Tis Here! `Tis Gone! (The Nature of Presence),\" we find this gem:The silence of the mountain is not our silence.The sound of the earth will never be Un Bel Di.We are a contingent occurrence. The white horseIn moonlight is more white than when it standsin sunlight. And even then it depends on whethera bell is ringing.This would likely be its own poem in Gilbert's earlier, tighter Monolithos. Likewise, this passage from \"Horses at Midnight without a Moon\" (p.63) could be a poem by itself.We know the horses are there in the darkmeadow because we can smell them,can hear them breathing.Our spirit persists like a man strugglingthrough the frozen valleywho suddenly smells flowersand realizes the snow is meltingout of sight on top of the mountain,knows that spring has begun.*The volume's central message, implied already in the title, is that this life is the real paradise. Even a minor poem can suddenly blossom with this message. After wading through the fog of the abstract beginning of \"Prospero Listening to the Night\" (fortunately Gilbert drops the Prospero persona in this volume - this is the only exception), we get to this:What he is listening to isthe muteness of the dogs at each farmin the valley. Their silence means nolover is abroad nor any vagrant lookingfor where to sleep. But there is a youngman, very still, under the heavy grapesin another part of Heaven. There are stillwomen hoping behind the dark windowsof farmhouses.**Some readers might object that what we have here is the limited poetry of an isolated individual, someone who protests too much about the virtues of poverty and solitude. Gilbert is not going to convince anyone that finding yourself old and alone crowns the \"good life.\" Contrary to Dickey's blurb on the back cover, I don't think that Gilbert teaches us how to live and die. To most people, human connection is more important by far than the sound of the oars in the dark.While Gilbert's narcissism can become tiresome, the genuine beauty of his lyrical lines, when he does achieve that beauty, makes it worth the occasional annoyance with statements like \"What interested him / most was who he was about to become\" - because before it we could feast on. . . Mortality likea cello inside him. Like rain in the dark.There are enough excellent poems and fine passages here that I'd recommend this book, especially to those readers who can forgive some abstraction and sententiousness. The beauties make it worth it. Just when you give up on a particular poem, you can come across this:Reality is not what we marry as a feeling. It is whatwalks up the dirt path, through the excessive heatand giant sky, the sea stretching away.",

Sebald: \"An extraordinarily handsome edition of poems by the late great writer\" (\"Confrontation\"). \"Unrecounted\" combines thirty-three of what W.G. Sebald called his \"micropoems\"--miniatures as unclassifiable as all of his works--with thirty-three exquisitely exact lithographs by one of his oldest friends, the acclaimed artist Jan Peter Tripp. The lithographs portray, with stunning precision, pairs of eyes--the eyes of Beckett, Borges, Proust Jasper Johns, Francis Bacon, Tripp, Sebald, Sebald's dog Maurice. Brief as haiku, the poems are epiphanic and anti-narrative. What the author calls \"time lost, the pain of remembering, and the figure of death\" here find a small home. The art and poems do not explain one another, but rather engage in a kind of dialogue. \"The longer I look at the pictures of Jan Peter Tripp,\" Sebald comments in his essay, \"the better I understand that behind the illusions of the surface, a dread-inspiring depth is concealed.

And my second thought was that the good people at New Directions are really milking his posthumous fame to try to sell this puzzling \"keepsake,\" as they call it, for $22.95, when it is so manifestly inferior to his other books. But luckily I kept the book on top of my desk for awhile and presently found myself returning to it again and again, trying to puzzle out what made it different than other books of poetry I had read. These \"micropoems,\" as the translator calls them, do creep under your skin.Here's one:The housein the nightthrough the windowsthe flickering light offlamesThat's it! As New Directions lays them out, these lines are all centered a la Michael McClure (it's hard to tell if Sebald planned this effect.) By the way the translator (Michael Hamburger) must be British and I wonder what a good US translator could have done with the German of these poems which the editor has supplied as an appendix for our eluctation at the back of the book. They are so short you could copy them all out on your lunch hour, but they gain weight and resonance by their placement next to the lithographs that inspired them-33 portraits by Sebald's best friend Jan-Peter Tripp) of people's eyes. (A lot of the poetry is about questions of seeing, perception, realization, etc) I thought I recognized some of the faces and I was right in one case only. The eyes are mostly those of famous artists (Francis Bacon, rembrandt, Jasper Johns, Barnett Newman) and writers (Capote, Borges, Burroughs) and some of the juxtapositions attain a transparency as luminous as ice water. But you don't find out whose eyes they are until the end, so the volume has the aspect of a parlor game to it. By the way, check out page 74. It says those are the eyes of Proust, but they look like Rex Harrison to me!So you're reading these haiku and puzzling over whose eyes are whose and before you know it, you are swept away into the land of the Unerzahlt for the ride of a lifetime.",

Still one is left with a satisfied feeling having read this (sideways printed) book of thoughts. The art of Tripp is stunning - eyes of famous writers and thinkers. In the end, in Sebald's own critical self examination, these works are \"time lost, the pain of remembering, and the figure of death\". As such, they gain more meaning. Grady Harp, September 05",

The Dover Thrift Edition contains an introductory note on the life of Tagore, who lived from 1861 to 1941. According to this note, Tagore, who wrote poetry in Bengali, translated \"Gitanjali\" himself into English. The Dover edition also contains a 1912 introduction by William Butler Yeats.This English version of \"Gitanjali\" is a series of prose poems that reflect on the interrelationships among the poet/speaker, the deity, and the world. Although Tagore had a Hindu background, the spirituality of this book is generally expressed in universal terms; I could imagine a Christian, a Buddhist, a Muslim, or an adherent of another tradition finding much in this book that would resonate with him or her.The language in this book is often very beautiful. The imagery includes flowers, bird songs, clouds, the sun, etc.; one line about \"the riotous excess of the grass\" reminded me of Walt Whitman. Tagore's language is sensuous and sometimes embraces paradox. Like Whitman and Emily Dickinson, he sometimes seems to be resisting traditional religion and prophetically looking towards a new spirituality.A sample of Tagore's style: \"I surely know the hundred petals of a lotus will not remain closed for ever and the secret recess of its honey will be bared\" (from section #98). As companion texts for this mystical volume I would recommend Jack Kerouac's \"The Scripture of the Golden Eternity\" and Juan Mascaro's translation of the Dhammapada.",

Over six decades Tagore gave the world some 2,500 songs, more than 2,000 paintings and drawings, 28 volumes of poetry, drama, opera, short stories, novels, essays and diaries and a vast number of letters.I would enthusiatically recommend this book by my favorite author.

His poems touch depths within the soul of the reader in unexpected and unimaginable ways ...Perhaps at the end of the day, the reader can concur with the words of Tagore in poem # 16: \"I have had my invitation to life's festival, and my life has been blessed. My eyes have seen and my ears have heard. It was my part to play upon my instrument, and I have done all I could. Now, I ask, has the time come at last when I may go in and see thy face and offer thee my salutations.\"Excerpts from Poem # 57 \"The butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light.

Some poems of Gitanjali are apt explanations of the &quot;problem of pain.&quot; Tagore's assertation that God's spirit is not most evident in a worship service but in the way man reacts to others is very important.

Rabindranath is totally naked here -- there is a vulnerability and a sincerity of emotion that is genuinely touching. The poet seems to see the whole world with the eyes of a child, full of inexpressible wonder and ineffable sweetness. It is as though Rabindranath has unconvered the art of seeing the sacred in everyone and everything. This is one of the greatest collections of poetry that I have ever seen.

Herbert's irony, his austere reserve and his compassion, the lucidity of his lyricism, the intensity of his sentiment toward classical antiquity, are not just trappings of a modern poet, but the necessary armor-in his case well-tempered and shining indeed-for man not to be crushed by the onslaught of reality.

Here is what former publisher Henry Holt had to say in 1945: &quot;In recent years, Stanley Kunitz has become recognized as one of the most original and thoughtful of our newer poets. His work is not simple, but mature, directly spoken and vigorous.&quot; The same could be said now 55 years later. Here is a morsel to whet the appetite:An agitation of the air, A perturbation of the lightAdmonished me the unloved year Would turn on its hinge that night.I stood in the disenchanted field Amid the stubble and the stones Amazed, while a small worm lisped to me The song of my marrow-bones.Blue poured into summer blue, A hawk broke from his cloudless tower, The roof of the silo blazed, and I knew That part of my life was over.Already the iron door of the north Clangs open: birds, leaves, snows Order their populations forth, And a cruel wind blows.Older than Thomas Hardy (87) or Robert Frost (88) when still writing and publishing quality poetry (now 95 and counting), this is over half a century of incredible textures, tones, colors,imagery, metaphor, soulful expression in stirring lines making what Yeats called &quot;words set to life's music&quot;. If this doesn't light your fire, go find your wood!",

                "review/text": "These 'Collected Poems of Stanley Kunitz' were put together when the poet was ninety- five years old. He now is approaching one - hundred and his birthday will be celebrated this year, also with another collection of his poetry.There are many reasons for wanting to read such a collection. First of all, it is interesting to see what a person has done in the course of a lifetime of work. As I understand it Kunitz evolved in style from a complex Blakean kind of writing to a more mature and simple style in which personal elements and reflections play a stronger part. Secondly, it is interesting to understand the accumulated ' wisdom' not simply in relation to his own literary craft but also about life and love in general. It is also interesting to see the kind of universes and worlds a person explores in their lifetime, in Kunitz's case these are of course many of the giants of English poetry, but his interests are also in activities like gardening,Jewish mystics, Russian poets of this century, and of course the passions of romantic love.I think that there is something also here which is especially admirable. Faithfulness to the task, the dedication and the ability to work through many years, is a triumph of the human spirit.This gives an added dimension to the enjoyment of the poetry.",
