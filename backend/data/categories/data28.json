        "description": "A mysterious high-profile homicide in the nation's capital collides with the dark side of national security in David Baldacci's new, heart-stopping thriller. TRUE BLUE Mason \"Mace\" Perry was a firebrand cop on the D.C. police force until she was kidnapped and framed for a crime. She lost everything-her badge, her career, her freedom-and spent two years in prison. Now she's back on the outside and focused on one mission: to be a cop once more. Her only shot to be a true blue again is to solve a major case on her own, and prove she has the right to wear the uniform. But even with her police chief sister on her side, she has to work in the shadows: A vindictive U.S. attorney is looking for any reason to send Mace back behind bars. Then Roy Kingman enters her life. Roy is a young lawyer who aided the poor until he took a high-paying job at a law firm in Washington. Mace and Roy meet after he discovers the dead body of a female partner at the firm. As they investigate the death, they start uncovering surprising secrets from both the private and public world of the nation's capital. Soon, what began as a fairly routine homicide takes a terrifying and unexpected turn-into something complex, diabolical, and possibly lethal.",

                "review/text": "If you've read the book description and reader reviews, you already know the basic plot of the story: boy (Zeb) loves girl (Rumer), girl loses boy to sister (Elizabeth), girl and boy rediscover each other, even though boy has a troubled 15 year old son (Michael) with girl's sister who is his ex-wife. I'm sorry but I just couldn't get past the many requirements for me to suspend my disbelief to really enjoy this book. If you grew up in a halfway normal family, you may have the same issue.First, you have to believe that Rumer and Zeb would entertain the thought of getting back together after Zeb's divorce to Rumer's sister, Elizabeth. Next you have to believe that the girls' father would welcome the man who destroyed the sisters' relationship back to town with an open invitation to go after Rumer. Is is just my dad who would have greeted him with a shotgun? Then you have to believe that Rumer hasn't met any other eligible men worthy of her love in all the years that her sister was married to Zeb. You also must believe that even though Rumer's and Zeb's love was so strong that it could overcome the quasi-incestuous (queasy incestuous for me) implications of the plot, it wasn't strong enough to overcome the flimsy obstacle that Elizabeth concocted to break them up in the first place. I won't give it away, but it is a misunderstanding that could have been cleared up with a phone call. Since Rumer and Zeb are next door neighbors, they could just have easily have discussed the issue in person. Finally, you have to believe that even though Elizabeth is a famous and talented actress, she is also a borderline psychotic sociopath (okay, maybe that's not such a stretch).I've deducted a star from the rating because I would expect to see this family on the Jerry Springer show, not in the pages of a sweet contemporary romance. Maybe it's just my six sisters and I who look at each other's husbands and boyfriends as brothers, with all the social boundaries that the relationship implies. I think Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen sang it best: &quot;Lord help the mister who comes between me and my sister, and Lord help the sister that comes between me and my man!&quot;",

                "review/text": "In her newest book, True Blue, Luanne Rice once again returns to the scene of two of her earlier books set at Hubbard's Point, Conn. As she did in Firefly Beach and Safe Harbor, this author fills the pages of True Blue with an emotional and ultimately rewarding journey.Rumer Larkin and Zeb Mayhew were always the typical boy and girl next door. They filled their days with school, paper routes and meetings at the town diner where they carved their initials into an oak table and left notes for one another in a desk drawer, a tradition at the diner. Their nights were spent on the roof of the Mayhew house where they star gazed and tested their knowledge about the heavens above. As the years went by they become closer and closer but during college their relationship changed forever and Zeb moved far away while Rumer returned to Hubbard's Point after her education was completed.Now, Zeb a well-known astronaut, is returning home in order to spend the summer at Hubbards point. A crucial event in Zeb's life finds him re-evaluating the past twenty years since he's seen Rumer and he;s beginning to realize that Rumer may be the only true blue woman in his life. Traveling along with Zeb is his rebellious 17 year-old son who has suddenly dropped out of high school. And as we realize from almost the first page, Zeb's former wife and his son's mother is none other than Rumer's older sister Elizabeth.Rumer, now a veterinarian, is content with her life. Caring for animals and awell-respected member of the town, she finally feels as though she has put to rest any feelings she may have once had for Zeb. But has she really put her feelings aside? And can Rumer ever forgive her sister who is now a famous actress and the mother of her only nephew? And what happens when Zeb's former home is to be torn down by the new owners forever changing the landscape of Hubbard's Point?.From the first page to the last, I was entranced by the life and people of Hubbard's Point. Besides Rumer, Zeb and Elizabeth, we meet the women of the Point who have lived there forever and are known as les Dames de la Roches and reminded me of the women from Colony by Anne Rivers Siddons. We also become familiar with Quinn, Rumer's orphaned young teen-age friend who becomes a good friend of Michaels as they both help each other to become happy. And we also become acquainted with Sixtus, Rumer's father, a man more prone to sailing the seas rather than staying at home who wishes true love for both of his daughters. I loved all of these characters, but most of all really enjoyed reading as the plot evolved and Rumer and Zeb consider taking a second chance at love.As a loyal reader of Luanne Rice's books for sometime, she never fails to offer me a wonderful and entertaining title. Not only does she describe family relationships beautifully, but strongly tugs at my heart and I suspect many other readers as well. True Blue is certainly no exception and I strongly recommend this book to those readers who enjoy an emotionally charged book. title.",

As a fan of LuAnne Rice's work I found the story easy to fall into,and the characters interesting, but the wackiness on pages 98-99 threw me. One moment a character is called Michael, and the next moment he's called Colin. Then suddenly he's Michael again. I kept going back over it to see if someone else had come on the scene or not!? Apparently one advantage of printing a hardback prior to going paperback is more thorough editing?! Strangely, the amazon description also describes the main character as \"Schoolteacher, Rumer Larkin\", who is in fact not a teacher at all, but a veterinarian.Don't get me wrong, I am not saying the story isn't good, but if I was LuAnne Rice I'd be wondering what my agent and editors were doing.If you've read any of Luanne Rice's other books, you will enjoy the references to other characters, and feel like you are among family once again. Read True Blue, and enjoy a nice summer read, but be willing to overlook some stuff.",

You might be lost if you hadn't read &quot;Safe Harbor&quot;.The last 7 of Luanne Rice's novels have taken place in the seaside Connecticut town of &quot;Hubbard's Point&quot; with some of the same characters reappearing, but never to the extent that &quot;Quinn&quot; does, here, in &quot;True Blue&quot;.I'm giving it 3 stars because I thought the novel was a little too melancholy and lacked urgency in the plot twists, what little there are.Still there is lots of imaginative ocean and seaside writing as Quinn goes through her daily, lobstering, crabbing, oystering, etc... along the shoreline.The main character of Rumor Larkin is interesting because she is a veterinarian who is attracted to an astronaut, Zebulon Mayhew----where does Luanne Rice get these names?Anyway, both Rumor and Zeb were next door neighbors who'd sit out on the roof of his home when they were kids, as astronaut, Zeb, would watch the stars. Rumor was land, and Zeb was sky. So corny and goofy-romantic.But is this enough to make a plot?It's certainly enough to make for evocative and poignant writing, which is a Luanne Rice staple, which is why I'm a dedicated fan of her novels, no matter how much they lack page-turning suspense.",

                "review/text": "TRUE BLUE is a novel which is well-written and thoughtful, and, for the most part, characteristically disappointing. Although I found myself dripping a few tears for the lead character, Rumer, I wasn't sure if it was because of the way her sister and childhood best friend/young adulthood boy friend, Zeb, pillaged her heart or the extremely cowardly way she handled the whole situation. During their college years, a note from Zeb was left for Rumer to meet him at the Indian Grave to consummate their relationship. Rumer didn't get the note because her sister hid the note. Zeb, who \"loves\" Rumer, didn't believe she never got it; he believes she is just afraid to make love to him and just won't tell him. Now, this is the woman whose heart was connected to his \"by a golden thread,\" yet he won't believe she didn't get the note. (Huh?) So instead of confronting her, he sleeps with her beautiful sister because she will put out. Eventually they marry and divorce in ten years. Twenty years later, he comes back home because he finally realizes Rumer is one he truly loves. Does Rumer ever rage at him for the way he tossed their love away because he didn't believe her when she explained about the note? Does she rage at him for going to her sister because she is beautiful and generous with her body? Does she rage at him because he destroyed an incredible relationship they had since they were kids? No, no, and no; she never does. At the end of the book, she FINALLY rages at her sister because she stole Zeb. But with Zeb, she just accepts the way he killed their relationship over a disputed note that could have been settled by talking about it; the way the book implies they talked about everything the throughout the time they were growing up. I can honestly say if Rumer had been a woman who fights for what is hers...as most women would have done...I would have really loved TRUE BLUE. The wimpy way she handled the situation sadly robbed the book of its true emotion and true intelligence.Also, although the book was well-written, I started to become distracted by the number of colons that appeared on a given page; there seemed to be more than on a busy day at the proctologist.",

I would love to move to Hubbard's Point, go lobstering with Quinn, another of Rice's enchanting characters and have my pets taken care of by Dr. Larkin. I would like to see a sequel to True Blue. I'd like to continue Rumer and Zeb's story, along with finding out what happens with Quinn and Michael. Ms. Rice has created such loveable characters that I have grown attached to them.

The story of Zeb and Rumer is amazing, and it brought tears to my eyes on just about every page. I also enjoyed how there were three stories interwoven into one book: Zeb and Rumer, Quinn and Michael, and Sixtus.Zeb and Rumer were childhood best friends, and were on the point of falling in love when Rumer's older sister ruined it. She married Zeb and created a big rift in the family. This story takes place after the divorce of Zeb and Elizabeth, when Zeb and his 17 year old son Michael return to Hubbard's Point.The love between Rumer and Zeb is so alive in this book, it leaps off the pages. I am hoping that Quinn and Michael will get their own book, as their story was just as intriguing. Sixtus's (Rumer and Elizabeth's father) journey was also interesting, though not as great as the rest of the story. I now have to go read about Dana and Sam, Quinn's aunt, who had their own story.If you like a good old fashioned romance, where boy meets girl and they fall in love, this is the story. It was wonderful, and I am looking forward to reading more of Luanne Rice's novels.",

Heroic LAPD officer Jac McGarvey is badly wounded and will not walk for months. His wife and his child are left to fend for themselves against both criminals that control an increasingly violent city and the dead director's cult of fanatic fans. In a lonely corner of Montana, Eduardo Fernandez, the father of McGarvey's murdered partner, witnesses a strange nocturnal sight. The stand of pines outside his house suddenly glows with eerie amber light, and Fernandez senses a watcher in the winter woods. As the seasons change, the very creatures of the forest seem in league with a mysterious presence. Fernandez is caught up in a series of chilling incidents that escalate toward a confronation that could rob him of his sanity or his life--or both. As events careen out of control, the McGarvey family is drawn to Fernandez's Montana ranch. In that isolated place they discover their destiny in a terrifying and fiercely suspenseful encounter with a hostile, utterly ruthless, and enigmatic enemy, from which neither the living nor the dead are safe.

                "review/text": "I picked this anthology up due to the inclusion of C.E. Murphy- and I was not disappointed! Murphy's tale, \"Banshee Cries\", continues the saga of Joanne Walker, the central figure in \"Urban Shaman\". In \"Urban Shaman\", Joanne was a police mechanic for the Seattle Police Department until the department replaced her while she was in Ireland with her dying mother. Consequently, she became an unwilling police officer who also has a spirit guide, Coyote. In this story, Joanne communicates with her dead mother, Sheila MacNamarra, to thwart a serial killer who had also tried to kill her mother. \"Moontide\" by Mercedes Lackey was an unexpected surprise for me. Moira na Ferson has been trained to be one of the Grey ladies- able to appropriately interact at court and yet have the skills of an assassin. Her father sent her away many years ago and has shown no interest in her until he mysteriously demands she return home. Once home at the Highclere Sea-Keep, she discovers her father, Lord Ferson, has befriended the pirate, Massid, Prince of Jendara. I won't spoil this intriguing story by revealing the nefarious plot Moira and Kedric the Fool uncover and ultimately thwart. \"The Heart of the Moon\" by Tanith Lee was the weakest of the three stories and a disappointment to me as I had previously read and enjoyed some of Lee's work. Clirando, a warrior for the goddess Parna, discovers her lover, Thestus, and her sister-friend, Araitha, have betrayed her by having sex. She challenges and beats both in duels and both are banished. Before Araitha leaves for her banishment, she curses Clirando. Clirando then receives word that Araitha died in a shipwreck, thus cementing the power of the curse. Clirando and a band of her warriors are then sent to the Moon Isle, a mysterious Isle where selected individuals were sent for the Seven Nights. From there, the story is a series of hallucinations/dreams where Clirando meets her true love, Zemetrios, and both earn their redemption. Perhaps others will enjoy the underlying meaning behind the story (such as the pigs representing Clirando's evil faces) but I felt it was too confusing. Overall, I recommend this anthology based on the strength of the stories by Murphy and Lackey.",

This is not a terrible novel, but it's very slow paced in the middle and the ending is not particularly satisfying. This is supposed to be an alien invasion story, but the alien is essentially little more than a two-dimensional monster. Little explanation is provided for why the alien behaves as it does, and I found this story made very little sense as a result. Koontz has told this type of monster story much better in other novels, most notably PHANTOMS.This novel also is very preachy in spots, where Koontz promotes his personal views on gun control, urban crime, the film industry, graffiti artists, heavy metal music, and a variety of other subjects. Although I mostly agree with Koontz's views, I don't read fiction to validate my own political beliefs. In any case, the sermonizing slows down the story.I'm a big Dean Koontz fan, and my advice is to avoid this novel if you've never read Koontz before. Instead, read some of his stronger novels, such as WATCHERS, ODD THOMAS, PHANTOMS, INTENSITY, LIGHTNING and FEAR NOTHING. Those novels will turn you into a fan.",

                "review/text": "I'd been trying to get a hold of this anthology for a while, so I was pleasantly surprised when Luna included it as the \"free\" book I received for trying their services. The three novellas in this volume, I believe, epitomize the blend of rich fantasy, strong female characters, and romantic elements offered by the books in the Luna line. Being a bit of a romantic myself, I prefer a solid \"happily ever after\" type ending, or at least a strong \"happy for now\" one. So, the first two novellas in this collection did deliver more solidly on that promise than did the last, but that in no way diminished my enjoyment of this collection, and each story within it.Moontide by Mercedes Lackey starts off this anthology. In this story, the author takes us back to her Five Hundred kingdoms, only this time, it tells the tale of the daughter of the lord of a Sea-Keep sent off to fosterling. Her father wants her back, and she's certain it's for a marriage proposal. However, the proposal doesn't exactly materialize, and what she discovers means treason against the crown. She has only the skills she learned as one of the Countessess' \"Grey Ladies\" and a Fool, on which she can rely. Will it be enough to stop a threat to not only the King's person, but his very kingdom?Having been disappointed with the author's work of late, I'm very pleased to have found a story which drew me in and kept me turning pages. Our heroine is a strongly drawn character, with a strength of will and a keen mind, which makes her the perfect foil for her father's plans. With the Fool, a man who is never quite completely drawn, we're shown that in him, she has a partner to help save the king. While the romance is understated, it is there, and is satisfactorily wrapped up in the story. I certainly hope we see more of the Grey Ladies in future stories.The Heart of the Moon by Tanith Lee is the middle story. A warrior, wounded by the betrayal of a man she called lover and a woman she called friend, finds herself cursed. When she's sent to the Isle of the Moon she finds herself on a spiritual journey and meets a man similarly betrayed. As they work through their issues, they discover a love for each other. Except once their time of the isle is over, they're torn apart, and have to find their way to each other.I'll be honest, I hadn't been impressed with Tanith Lee's contributions to romance anthologies in the past, and I didn't expect much this time around. However, this story with is poignant characterization and the emotional trails of the characters, created a compelling read, and once that impressed this reader. The Heart of the Moon is a journey of the heart.Banshee Cries by C.E. Murphy, ended the anthology. An author whose work I wanted to read, I found myself eagerly looking forward to this story. A reluctant beat cop has to come to grips with her shamanic power, her dead mother, and her position within the police department.I found the characterization and sense of place in this story; however, I kept looking for romantic content and found it lacking. This was mentioned as being book 1.5 of the series, so perhaps reading the first book would help ground the reader in the world and the sense of place. However, as an urban fantasy story, this tale does its job in creating an otherworldly sense to our day-to-day lives, and the narrator's unique and strong voice makes it a page-turning read.",

Here, a heroic, Los Angeles Police Department cop, Jack McGarvey, is shot and almost killed in a wild shoot out which sees several civilians killed, as well as his partner, the second partner Jack has lost inside of a year. After a four month convalescence, Jack, his wife Heather, and their son Toby receive an unexpected gift, seemingly from the Gods. Eduardo Hernandez, the father of his former partner of eleven years, died and left Jack a six hundred acre ranch in Montana, as well as a substantial sum of cash. Having decided that enough is enough, Jack and Heather agree to relocate to Montana.Unbeknownst to Jack, before seventy year old Eduardo Hernandez died, he had been experiencing some mighty strange goings on at the ranch. One night, a bizarre, electronic oscillation pulsed through the bone deep quiet of the Montana air, coming in disturbing waves, accompanied by the sense of an alien presence. An amber radiance resonated through the pine woods surrounding the ranch. Lasting only seven minutes, the phenomena disappeared, only to return a month later in an even more disquieting fashion. Louder, with more rhythmic pounding, it caused the house to vibrate. An undulation of sound lured Eduardo out of his home, where a luminescent amber radiance once again emanated from the woods, calling out to him, the sense of an alien presence overwhelming. It then disappeared, as quickly as it began. A month later, the same thing occured, only this time a two dimensional doorway into infinite blackness appeared, a portal into the unknown. Soon after this portal appeared, the surrounding wildlife began to act strangely. Just what was going on?Read this book and find out. Just remember...leave the lights on!",

Yet another plucky young girl who, through the power of feminism, can walk circles around the rest of her society, solving a barely transparent plot against the kingdom. I suppose fans of hers will like it well enough, as it's fairly typical of her work.I'd been meaning to read some Tannith Lee for some time, and I can see the appeal. I liked her writing style, and the character-centric story. It was okay, even enjoyable, but fairly forgettable.But I loved the C.E. Murphy story. She's got such a strong and clear voice. This ties directly into last year's \"Urban Shaman\" novel, and is a nice continuation of the story. I'd recommend reading that instead, but if you do and you want more, this is a large enough chunk to make it worth the trouble. Ultimately, I hope that this causes fans of the more popular Lee and Lackey to discover this exciting new author.",

I am not sure why it's titled as such, but I liked how the stories of the family in Los Angeles and of Eduardo on Quatermass ranch, got brought together in the middle, only to finish in an explosive end. Without giving the plot away, and writing yet another summary, I liked this book for a few simple reasons;- The main characters, Jack and his family are really likable. They are storing people, and I found myself reading thoughts they expressed, and feeling that I feel the same way about things in life.- Eduardo is an older man, living alone on Quatermass ranch, far away from any cities or people, and he discovers creepy things. Animals around him acting weird, dirt and stench in his house, scary pulsating and noises that grows stronger and stronger.It was hard to read it at night, because the old man was alone, and I literally had to remember to breather when he kept discovering things. Good read after all, another nice book form Koontz.I only with the ending was longer, in so many Koontz books, the fight up the hill gets to a dramatic climax only to let go and end very quickly on a page or two.-",

                "review/text": "One of the last traditional Koontz &quot;creature features&quot;, this piece of work is not a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but still a fast-paced, moderately enjoyable read none-the-less. The setting initially begins in Montana, where Eduardo Fernandez comes upon an evil presence in the woods. The solitary man begins a battle against the horrific unknown, only to succomb to its terror. Skip to Los Angeles, California, where police officer Jack McGarvey and his partner are ambushed by a killer, murdering the partner and serverely injuring the protagonist. To avoid the dangers of the big city, the recovering Jack decides to take his family away to a secluded old ranch in Montana.The new lives of the McGarvey family seem simple and enjoyable enough. They do not have too many nearby neighbors, but they are happy enough in their new sanctuary and are ready to begin a new life together. However, this was before some strange occurences start to take place in the home. This is before they realize that a merciless, undead terror is about to make their lives a living hell.Not as symbolic as many of his other novels, this Koontz romp is strictly horror business without the extraneous variables. The McGarvey family is only fairly likable; readers obviously are not rooting against them, but they are slightly under-developed compared to other character families in some of his past tales. Overall, &quot;Winter Moon&quot; will not put you to sleep, but it not cause you to read the last page in triumph either.",

As the book unfolds, moving seamlessly between Haiti in the 1960s and New York City today, we enter the lives of those around him, and learn that he has also kept a vital, dangerous secret. Edwidge Danticat's brilliant exploration of the \"dew breaker\"--or torturer--s an unforgettable story of love, remorse, and hope; of personal and political rebellions; and of the compromises we make to move beyond the most intimate brushes with history.

She writes clear, sharp, poignant sentences that go straight to the heart. And the story, itself, is chilling.The book is episodic and can be looked at a series of short stories. But they're all interrelated, and tell the story of Haiti over the past twenty years. A \"dew breaker\" is a prison guard who tortures the captives in his charge. And he is the central character in the book. He now lives in Brooklyn and has a loving wife and a grown up daughter. He now works as a barber and his past seems a long time ago. We see him through his daughter's eyes as he reveals his true past to her. The daughter loves her father but this new fact about his life is hard to accept.We also meet other Haitian people, living in America. There's the nurse who sends most of her paycheck home to her mother. There's the young man who brings his wife to this country. There's another man who travels back to Haiti to visit his dying aunt. There are three Haitian women learning English and sharing their stories with each other.Eventually, we flash back to the story of the \"dew breaker\" in Haiti. It's not a pleasant story but yet a very human one. Even though we don't forgive, we do understand.I was a little reluctant to read this book. I thought it would have detailed horrors and be excessively brutal. I was glad that Ms. Danticant, in her wisdom, spent most of her time on character development and story. She only put in a few of the horrible details, mostly focusing on the people, rather than on the gore.The book is only 242 pages long, a fast read. It left me with a deep understanding of Haiti, its people, and what is going on in the news today.",

                "review/text": "Author Danticat introduces her story of Haitian immigrants and the lives they have escaped in Haiti with the story of Ka, a young sculptress whose parents think of her as a \"good angel,\" her name also associated symbolically with the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Ka is in Florida with her father to deliver a powerfully rendered sculpture to a Haitian TV actress. Ka's father, who served as the model for the sculpture, however, destroys it, confessing tearfully that he is not the man his daughter has always believed him to be, and admitting that the disfiguring scar on his face was not the result of torture in a Haitian prison. He was \"the hunter,\" he says, and \"not the prey,\" one of the \"dew breakers,\" or torturers, who as part of the Tonton Macoutes, committed political assassinations and inflicted unimaginable tortures on orders of dictators Francois Duvalier and his son \"Baby Doc\" between 1957-86.In a series of episodes which resemble short stories more than a novel in form, Danticat illuminates the lives of approximately a dozen Haitian immigrants as they remember this traumatic period \"back home.\" As the \"novel\" alternates between past and present, it is told from disparate points of view--those of Ka's mother and father, a young man visiting Haiti after ten years to see his blinded aunt, a wedding seamstress in New York, a Haitian-American reporter investigating a possible \"dew-breaker,\" a man remembering a Haitian friend's long-ago disappearance as he awaits his son's birth in New York, and a popular Haitian preacher whose arrest affects lives for many years.The novel gains much of its power from the horrors of vividly described torture and the overwhelming fear engendered by the Tonton Macoute militia. By calling up such emotionally charged memories and presenting them in a series of episodes, the author can let the personal stories unfold without having to order events so that they lead to a grand climax. What distinguishes this \"novel\" from a short story collection, however, is the repeating motifs that appear throughout these seemingly separate episodes (a man's widow's peak, a woman's fear of cemeteries, for example), and by the end of the novel the connections among all the characters become obvious. A vivid documentation of many of the worst human rights abuses of the century, Danticat's novel is a moving testament to the Haitians' resilient spirit and a celebration of their survival.

                "review/text": "Danticat's a hot commodity these days. Her first two novels have received much acclaim and this effort has been much anticipated. It hasn't hurt that Haiti is very much in the spotlight as the book becomes available, with all the attendant images of violence that accompany a Haitian coup. So, all in all, reading The Dew Breakers should have been a blockbuster experience. Sadly, it was not.The protagonist of The Dew Breaker (so named because he would habitually come for his victims in the very early morning, when the grass was wet with pre sunrise dew) is a former torturer for the Duvalier regime, now, as the book opens, a reformed family man living in suburban New York. His sadism is chronicled through a series of vignettes centering on a swath of his victims. Essentially, this novel is a loosely related series of short stories that uses the device of the protagonist as the glue that's supposed to hold the whole enterprise together. This is not an entirely successful undertaking as the protagonist is so steeped in shadow and mystery as to never truly come into focus enough to be an identifiable entity. Some of the vignettes are truly moving and, on their own, have genuine emotional impact. That impact dissipates, however, as the intrusion of the literary device that underpins the book often in fact acts to dispels emotional intensity and thus rob the narrative of its power.Danticat has a writing style that is often described as simple and elegant but which, to my mind, often can only be described as plain. This book is easy to read by there is a decided lack of any sort of lyrical quality to the work.However, the real problem with the book is it never even attempts to answer the questions it raises. History is full of monsters who were attentive parents, kind to their mothers and loved their pets. The question is-and Danticat broaches it-how do these freaks accommodate the inherent contradictions of their nature? History is also full of monsters who, for whatever reason, turn their back on their former life, reforming themselves into, if not something noble, at least into something no longer a monster. Where does the sadism, the cruelty, the inhumanity go when this happens? Danticat makes no effort to resolve these issues. At best, the book can be said to be infused with a sense of moral ambiguity regarding its protagonist. Even the question of whether the author intends for one to grant the torturer absolution for his sins is left indefinite.In the final analysis, the book sinks under the burden of great expectations. It does not live up to its hype and reviews. That's not to say it's a bad book-it's not. It's just that, when all is said and done, the feeling one is left with is that this particular glass has to be viewed as half empty. That is a great disappointment given the hopes I had for the book going in.",

                "review/text": "Danticat is enormously good for us, especially now. She reminds us of the beautiful literary spirit of Haiti... much like that glorious cadre of revolutionary Haitian women literary figures Ghislaine Charlier, Jan J. Dominique, Nadine Magloire, and of course Marie Chauvet and more recently Myriam Chancy. Exquisite writers all. Danticat, like her sisters, reminds us of the rich literary legacy that truly celebrates all that is beautiful about this much maligned and misunderstood country. Danticat herself, in my view, is an accident of literary privilege, a formidably keen observer or witness to events that have happened or to what is currently happening. This story, The Dew Breaker, while a horribly true tale of interwoven lives connected gruesomely by the &quot;beast&quot;, actually chose her; she is the extremely gifted and talented vessel that serves to receive this story.Is there redemption for the protagonist, the shouk&egrave;t laroze himself? I don't know. Perhaps even Danticate isn't quite certain. The protagonist, an ultimately pathetic soul, is caught up in a nightmarish episode of reality --as is all of Haiti. As his daughter peels away the layers of his humanity, penetrating ever so deeper into his tortured soul to see just who he is, she too (like us) arrives at the point of moral ambiguity about her father. The skillful artistry in Danticat actually tortures us with this sense of indefiniteness ... which is what all excellent writers often do, of course. With measured steps,the author takes a daring literary plunge into the often risky arena between the short story and the novella. She triumphs wonderfully. In telling a painfully good story, Danticat presents us with real people agonizing in their search for answers, explanations and understandings.

                "review/text": "Throughout The Dew Breaker, evil prevails in all its manifestations, particularly in the guise of authority, demanding homage from the persecuted. This novel is beautifully constructed; characters fall into place within the chapters, the infinite connections that bind one life to another clearly drawn. In each facet of her story, the author builds the momentum in this cautionary tale of horror, love, rebelliousness and hope, touched with myth and memory.As the novel begins, a young woman gazes upon her father with eyes of love, unaware of his past. Finally confessing his carefully hidden secret, he is revealed as deeply flawed, his actions virtually unforgivable. The scar he wears on his face carries a terrible history, his life in America built on deception. In his mouth the truth is a lie. Although the father pardons himself, there are many who damn him for the monster of their nightmares.Weaving through the chapters, we learn of those who have been touched by brutal dictatorship and oppression, where unmarried women bear fatherless children, eking out the most basic existence. Haiti, an island paradise, turns into hell under a despot's reign of terror, freedom a vague dream, while the hungry scratch for garbage, all under a starlit sky of infinite beauty. Even when these characters find a different life in America, they carry the indelible scars of Haiti in their hearts.This passionate novel is an assemblage of powerful interrelated stories; here a chorus of voices hums, the heard and the unheard, the \"disappeared\", the unborn, the women whose voice boxes have been surgically removed, the desperate murmur of prayers, the eternal silence of the dead and the staccato of random gunfire. There is a staggering contrast between good and evil in The Dew Breaker, as well as the grinding reality of a world made suddenly transcendent in the bright rays of the morning sun. Horrifying, how evil walks so freely through the world, casually touching its victims, then casually strolling into the quiet evening and a peaceful existence, unexposed and unrelenting.

While these stories are not told in chronological order, each deals roughly with the protagonist. My favorite story is 'Night Talkers', the tale of one man who travels back to the Haitian mountains to tell his grandmother that he believes he knows the whereabouts of the man who killed his parents when he was a young child. I found the descriptions of rural life fascinating and wanted to learn more about the local customs. But other than a few select stories, I didn't find this collection to be particularly noteworthy. I tend to read many short story compilations and I would rate THE DEW BREAKER as standard. The premise of these stories is certainly appealing as there is an abundance of individuals in the world today who attempt to hide from their violent past and remain undiscovered.

It was becoming like any another job,\" Edwidge Danticat has taken an enormous emotional and aesthetic risk by choosing to tell his story from his daughter's sympathetic point of view. Ms. Danticat also displays her story telling gifts by two astonishing twists in the plot and her capable handling of a central trope that reveals even as it hides the past of one of its central characters.In The Dew Breaker, Danticat has succeeded in showing us that love, even for a monster, can have redemptive effect. And while Ka Bienaim''s father can never fully accept the grace offered to him by Anne, his wife, and Ka, his daughter-he destroys a statue of himself that was a gift from his daughter-he does live a reformed life after he leaves Haiti.The Dew Breaker is a sublime work and the tone that Ms. Danticat maintains throughout the work captures the moral dilemma of the \"hunter and the hunted.\" It is easy to want revenge for horrific acts that have been done to our loved ones. But killers have families and children who love them, and they are in desperate need of the kind of salvific love that Anne offers.

                "review/text": "One of the book's face pages mentions that the \"Dew Breaker\" is actually comprised of many shorter stories, some of which were previously published independently of one another in various journals. It takes an artist to blend these discrete stories, string them together as chapter titles, making them cohesive so that the reader understands a larger picture. Danticat does this with style, with escalating tension, and by drawing the reader into a maze of facts, characters and their personal stories with similar characteristics. All their lives have been touched by the reigns of terror under the Haitian dictators, Papa Doc and Bebe Doc Duvalier.The novel opens with the Dew Breaker's telling his beloved daughter of his background. Prior to the confession, he had been the tortured...not the torturer. And, following this confession, the story moves back and forth in time.One very clever touch, among many, is the portion where the Dew Breaker, now a respectable barber living a very quiet life in New York attends Christmas Eve Mass with his daughter and wife, Anne. Ka, his daughter, stares at a man she thinks to be a wanted man in Haiti. His picture appears on posters all over town because of his human rights violations. In the end, noticing the suspect bears an overall resemblance to the criminal, but is not an exact match, the reader is drawn to the fact that her own father, the Dew Breaker, altered his own appearance so as not to be recognized. He was formerly described as a very large man. No more. A parallel to the man in the pew?Going along with this strain of disguises, the bridal dress seamstress is also sure the Dew Breaker lives across the street from her but when a nosy reporter attempts to look into the house, a neighbor tells her no one has lived there for a long time. When this is pointed out to the seamstress, she relates that no matter where she moves, he finds her. How? Because she tells her \"girls\" (the various women who utilize her dressmaking skills) when she is moving. That's how the Dew Breaker knows. Is this accurate? Her imagination, grown out of her own story of horror when the Dew Breaker tortured her because she would not date him?Then there is Anne, his wife, who has known her husband's story for many years and has willing collaborated in her husband's obscure existence in order to keep a very low profile. They have no friends, cannot risk ever being recognized, seem to operate exclusively in a Haitian neighborhood. Which begs the question, wouldn't the probabilities be even greater that a criminal would heighten the chances of his recognition in a smaller neighborhood where so many have been touched by the regimes of the Duvaliers?Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that if the personification of horrors lives and works just down the street, a victim would be less likely to stir up a hornets nest! Nonetheless, Anne too, was touched by the Dew Breaker. Her own stepbrother was murdered by him yet she appears to believe that her stepbrother, a minister who openly preached against the regime, committed suicide. Is the author trying to show that many mechanisms are employed to stay alive? To attempt to forget? To make the best of the hand one is dealt?Danticat employs interesting characters to tell her short stories and she effectively uses the breaks in the various narratives to grow her overall story. And those short stories also provide her with the mechanism to jump back and forth in time between Haiti and New York. The reader is transported briefly into the stories of these diverse characters, their time in history, its effects on their lives and, when blended together, they create a whole, engrossing story.Her final coup d'etat is the story of the \"Dew Breaker\" himself; he is detestable, heartless, ruthless, cunning and he has become the quiet scholar, the man fascinated with the Egyptian \"Book of the Dead\". What does he seek there?",

                "review/text": "Edwidge Danticat has written a wonderfully crafted novel in stories in her fourth fiction release, The Dew Breaker. The title is taken from the term used for the men who were torturers during the Duvalier regime in Haiti during the 1960s.The Book of the Dead is the opening chapter of the book in present day, a story initially published in the New Yorker magazine. A young artist and her father, a respected citizen and business owner in the Haitian community of Brooklyn, New York, take a trip to Florida to deliver a sculpture when suddenly both the father and the art disappear. This sets in motion a series of interconnected stories by expatriate Haitians, who have been affected by this man, a former member of the Toutou army under the Papa Doc Duvalier's reign of torture and terror. The story is the catalyst for the subsequent stories that can stand alone as complete but have a thread that interweaves place, persons and time that culminates in a satisfying and intense ending.Almost every character has been touched by the Dew Breaker. The young man in Night Talkers who returns to his native village in the Haitian countryside is certain his landlord in Brooklyn is the man who killed his father before he was born; the English as a Second Language student in The Funeral Singer whose painter husband was killed for painting an unflattering picture of the dictator; the young boy in Haiti who never knew his father in Monkey Tails and the retiring bridal seamstress who believes the man who abused her thirty years prior is now her neighbor in The Bridal Seamstress. The ending story with the same title as the book is a sobering, moving tale that renders one drained emotionally without judgment of the antagonist.This reviewer has enjoyed and respected some of Danticat's past writings but this offering has earned her at the top of the list as one of my favorite writers. The language flows like waves over a blue ocean, brilliant color splayed over lines that dance off of the page. Lyrical, poignant, powerful; this work of art resonates with the reader for days later.Dera WilliamsAPOOO BookClub",

                "review/text": "Edwidge Danticat's third novel, THE DEW BREAKER, arrives in bookstores on the heels of major turmoil in the author's native Haiti: in February Jean-Bertrand Aristide resigned the presidency and fled the country, sparking nationwide riots and the involvement of U.S. marines. These newspaper headlines make THE DEW BREAKER all the more topical and meaningful --- perhaps even more important --- on these shores, and the emotions in the story are all the more intense and vivid for the immediacy these events lend them. But to Danticat's considerable credit, this highly accomplished and extraordinarily powerful novel does not need these concurrent events to engage and move the reader; instead THE DEW BREAKER disinters the country's tumultuous past to reveal how generations of Haitians live in constant upheaval, no matter how far from their country they travel.Danticat structures THE DEW BREAKER as a series of revealing vignettes, each following a different set of characters and tracing its own narrative arc. What keeps it from being relegated to the recent --- and frustrating --- trend of novels-in-short-stories is the focused cohesiveness of its chapters: each examines a different facet of a much larger issue while contributing significantly to a larger storyline.In &quot;The Book of the Dead,&quot; a young Brooklyn sculptor and art teacher named Ka Bienaim&eacute; learns that her father was not an inmate in a Haitian prison, as she has believed all her life, but a torturer --- a &quot;dew breaker&quot; --- under dictator Francois Duvalier during the 1960s. As her mother explains, &quot;Your father was the hunter. He was not the prey.&quot; But as she tries to accept this news, she begins to question her parents' view of Haiti and wonders whether &quot;maybe his past offered more choices than either hunter or prey.&quot;The story-chapters that follow travel back and forth between New York and Haiti, between the unfulfilled hope of America and the crushing disillusion of the island country. But each segment of the novel somehow refers back to Ka's father and the agony and misery he inflicted on his people.In &quot;Night Talkers,&quot; Dany, an immigrant in New York, travels back to Haiti to visit his aunt Estina, who raised him after his parents were murdered. In &quot;Monkey Tails,&quot; Dany's roommate Michel recounts his friend's escape from the country during the riots. Another roommate, unnamed in &quot;Seven,&quot; saves money to bring his wife over from Port-au-Prince, only to find that seven years apart, coupled with the stresses of their new life in America, have dramatically altered their relationship. All three men live in the apartment basement next to the home of Ka's parents, who run a barber shop and are fixtures in New York's Haitian community; this connection binds them all together in a larger, overarching narrative.Danticat also gives voice to people who felt Ka's father's cruelty directly. The title character in &quot;The Bridal Seamstress&quot; shows a reporter the scars on her feet where, after she declined his advance, he whipped all the skin off her soles and made her walk the long trip on bloody bare feet. In &quot;The Funeral Singer,&quot; R&eacute;zia, whose husband he killed, takes classes to earn her high school degree, which is meaningless to her small but successful restaurant, but allows her to form a friendship with two of her classmates.In telling these stories from these different viewpoints, Danticat creates a makeshift community, an ever-shifting shadow society of the characters' native Haiti. The violence and brutality the title character inflicts on his people, therefore, exists not in a vacuum, but in a very specific context.Danticat is a writer blessed with both the curiosity to wonder how people can enact such cruelties on others and the wisdom to know that the answers are frighteningly complex and utterly impossible to explain in words. The task is futile, but as THE DEW BREAKER undeniably proves, the effort is worthwhile, even merciful. In the end, Danticat does not judge her main character or anyone else, but merely reminds us that &quot;atonement, reparation, was possible and available for everyone.&quot;--- Reviewed by Stephen M.

                "review/text": "This is one of Maugham's least-read works, judging from its absence in most bookstores and libraries. Of Human Bondage, Cakes and Ale, The Moon and Sixpence are usually fairly easy to locate on most shelves. You must do a little digging to find this one, but it will reward your efforts.At the center of the book is Oliver Haddo, who, as you can tell from the other reviews here, is based entirely and without much thought of disguise upon Aleister Crowley, the London necromancer. The plot is indeed pure melodrama, the virginal fiance drawn irresistibly towards her doom by dark forces against which there appears to be no defense. Think of Bram Stoker, or Coppola if you haven't read the novel. Will our hero somehow find a way to overcome the great odds and emerge victorious? Will Haddo succeed in his plan of evil debauchery? Stay tuned for the heady conclusion.What saves The Magician from sinking into the morass of its conventional and even hackneyed plot is the quality of Maugham's writing. We are aware at all times that we are in the hands of an accomplished writer and artist, who can turn a tired theme into an event of wit and real pathos. At times the scenes are in fact quite chillingly rendered as well. There is real suspense here, as well as some startlingly weird and realistic depictions of the occult. The scene that comes most readily to mind is Haddo's creation of the homonculi, some home-grown little fiends he cooks up in a test-tube. Many of the scenes have a surreal edge to them, but are grounded in enough realistic detail to lend them plausibility at the same time.I would recommend this book to those who have read and enjoyed Maugham's other works, as well as to anyone who enjoys books about the occult or to fans of horror novels (of which there are legion). It's an easy and fun read and is frightening enough that it just might have you looking over your shoulder the next time you're dining in a London restaurant, double-checking to see if Haddo might not be sitting somewhere across the room. Then again, these days, a lot of women probably hope that he is.",

                "review/text": "This is possibly the strangest of all Maugham novels that I've read. It starts innocently enough with the type of sophisticated turn of the century Parisian characters that populate much of his fiction. The characters are lucidly established and we are slowly drawn into their relationships and longings in typical Maugham fashion. Then we are introduced to the strange eccentric character of Oliver Haddo and with each of his subsequent appearances the theme of lurking evil is masterfully developed. The plot then takes over in a way that I felt was unique for Maugham and this novel turns into a suspenseful page turner. It is in someways reminiscent of Dracula. The climax builds relentlessly and the last half of the book is virtually impossible to put down once it's begun. Wonderfully blends a horror tale with the cultural sophistication of all Maugham's writing.",

In particular, the character of the deliciously wicked Oliver Haddo, based on the infamous Aleister Crowley, &quot;the wickedest man alive,&quot; jumps off the page. However, like Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; (a book that in structure &quot;The Magician&quot; resembles more than a little) the plot can sag slightly when the villain is off-stage. Luckily, this is never for more than a handful of pages.Still surprisingly fresh and readable nearly a hundred years after its first publication, this book will appeal as much to the literate horror fan as to the typical &quot;Twentieth Century Classics&quot; reader.",

                "review/text": "This novel is based on a character whom Somerset Maugham met in Paris in 1897 called Aleistair Crowley. He was a liar, a boastful man and a voluminous writer of mediocre verse. He was also dabbing in Satanism, magic and occult. He inspired Somerset Maugham and served as a model for Oliver Haddo in &quot;The Magician&quot;.Arthur Burdon, surgeon of St Luke's in London, has just arrived in Paris to study the methods of the French operators. But he has also come there to see Margaret Dauncy with whom he is in love. It is Dr Porhoet, a lifetime friend of Arthur's, who introduces him to Oliver Haddo. This obese, fleshy-faced man with an imposing paunch claims to be a magician. At a dinner party, the guests can hardly believe the stories told by this charlatan. They wonder whether he is an impostor or a madman and how much he really believes what he says. Does he deceive himself or is he laughing up his sleeve at the madness of those who take him seriously? To Arthur's bewilderment, as he is about to marry Margaret, she falls under the spell of Oliver Haddo and flees with him. Yet Arthur can hardly picture into what abyss of horror and evil Margaret will be driven.A complex and perceptive novel. The theme of evil is perfectly woven into a story stunning for its action and vivid characters.I recommend the audio version from Audible.com. Listening to Frederick Davidson reading &quot;The Magician&quot; is a pure delight!",

Haddo is an eccentric character who is deeply occupied with occult mysteries and perhaps has dark powers of his own (or is he joking?)Arthur and Margaret take an instant dislike to Haddo, and when he and Arthur become enemies, strange things begin to happen...Soon the sensible and rational Arthur finds himself in way over his head in mysteries, when he tries to save the woman he loves from a truly horrible fate!The story is interesting and haunting, but the characters are a bit too rigid for my taste, and - except for Haddo - without much nuance. I'm aware that the themes they represent are the main focus of the novel, but I would have liked more &quot;3 dimensional&quot; characters (again except for Haddo).The plot is well constructed and interesting, and the explorations of the dark arts and it's practises are fascinating!I won't reveal too much of the story here, as it takes some interesting twists and turns along the way!

Put this one high on your summer list.\"-Stephen King When a small-town family is pushed to the brink, how far will they go to protect one of their own? An edgy, propulsive read about what we will do in the name of love and blood Tony has always looked out for his younger brother, Nick. So when he's called to a hospital bed where Nick is lying battered and bruised after a violent sexual assault, his protective instincts flare, and a white-hot rage begins to build. As a small-town New England lawyer, Tony's wife, Julia, has cases involving kids all the time. When Detective Rice gets assigned to this one, Julia feels they're in good hands. Especially because she senses that Rice, too, understands how things can quickly get complicated. Very complicated. After all, one moment Nick was having a drink with a handsome stranger; the next, he was at the center of an investigation threatening to tear not only him, but his entire family, apart. And now his attacker, out on bail, is disputing Nick's version of what happened. As Julia tries to help her brother-in-law, she sees Tony's desire for revenge, to fix things for Nick, getting out of control. Tony is starting to scare her. And before long, she finds herself asking: does she really know what her husband is capable of? Or of what she herself is? Exploring elements of doubt, tragedy, suspense, and justice, The Damage is an all-consuming read that marks the explosive debut of an extraordinary new writer.",

                "review/text": "&quot;Damage&quot; was another book I bought on a whim because it was on sale. I didn't have a clue about the plot since there wasn't a synopsis on the back and most of the reviews inside were pretty vague.To begin with, &quot;Damage&quot; is a pretty small book (218 pages) with short chapters and spare writing. Most people will be able to read it in one day if you have nothing else to do.The book is told in the first person by Stephen Fleming who is a middle-aged politician in British parliament. He leads a very safe, boring life with his beautiful wife Ingrid and two adult children, Martyn and Sally. Everything changes though when he meets his son's new girlfriend, Anna Barton, at a party. His attraction to her is immediate and overpowering. Their affair begins after a few family get-togethers when Anna calls out of the blue and they make arrangements to meet at her place.From the beginning, you know the relationship won't go any further than the bedroom (if they make it that far), but you get swept away anyways in Stephen's loss of control and growing obsession. Anna seems to remain a mystery, however, even after she confesses the strange death of her brother, who had killed himself years ago because he couldn't have her.The ending, of course, is tragic and depressing when Stephen and Anna's affair is discovered. The darkness of the book might be a little too much for some, but if you like gloomy, erotic novels, I highly recommend you read &quot;Damage&quot;.Obviously, there are some sex scenes in the book, but they're not raunchy or overly descriptive. The movie scenes, however, are much more graphic than the book's, especially if you see the unrated version of &quot;Damage&quot;. So, if you're highly offended by incest and adultery, you probably should just skip this one.&quot;Damage&quot; was made into a movie in 1992 (aka &quot;Fatale&quot;), starring Jeremy Irons as Stephen Fleming (who I thought was perfect for the part, especially if you've seen him in &quot;Lolita&quot;) and Juliette Binoche as Anna Barton. Although the movie follows the same structure of the book, I still didn't think the movie was that good, despite the several other great actors and actresses (Rupert Graves, Miranda Richardson). I can't pinpoint what I didn't like about it; I just didn't care for it. I certainly wouldn't recommend the movie unless you're really into the book or a fan of one of the above actors or actresses. Stick to the book instead.",

Few authors can portray that ellusive state of suspended animation which anticipates catastropic change. Stephen is completely unaware of the banality of existence that he finds himself in; a state neither alive nor dead. When he meets Anna, his perception undergoes a gestalt-type shift and he at once realizes that things can no longer be as they were. Anna's own warning to Stephen - beware damaged people, for they are the ones who survive - sums up the theme of this novel, in which passion is cast in terms of power and actions inevitablely lead to irreversible and tragic consequences. Reading this novel is analogous to watching a car accident: morbid facination prevents you from looking away, ever aware of the compulsion that it could be you at the wheel at that pivitol moment when the illusion of control is shattered.",

Then, as the formula demands, he and others pay the consequences. In the end, with its lifeless characters and painfully predictable trajectory, it's a big \"So what.\"Strong points:The author's prose is very easy to read, which, in itself, is a greater achievement than some might imagine.It's short, you can read this in a single sitting, 2 maybe 3 hours max. It may be a harmless way to waste time while waiting at an airport or to lull yourself to sleep on the plane.Neutral point:Makes no demands on the reader. You do not have to bring any special expertise or experience to this tale in order to get everything out of it. (In fact, too much imagination, wide ranging interests, or life experience will likely destroy any interest in reading past the first few pages.)Now for the bad points:This tale is very thin, even thinner than the book itself. It may have worked as a short story but should have never gone much beyond 10 pages. It just doesn't have the legs to support itself.The characters are so flat and lifeless that the reader is given no reason to care about any single one of them. Maybe this reflects the flat, lifeless existence of the narrator before (and, as far as I can tell, after) he discovered lust, but it doesn't work at all for me.The narrative voice is supposed to be that of a 50ish man but it sounds like an inexperienced school girl giving her impression of adult male lust. The voice was so jarring, so off putting, that it was a struggle for me to maintain an image of the narrator as a male. I'm not kidding, I re-read some of the initial paragraphs several times to see if I had missed some gender cue. Then I briefly wondered if the guy's \"dark\" secret had something to do with a belated discovery of homoerotic inclinations or trans-sexuality. No such luck. In a few pages I realized the inapposite voice simply reflected the author's significant limitations. But that girlish voice in a grown man's body was really bothersome.The author sprinkles the text with little phrases that I suppose are intended to sound profound or insightful but instead come across as trite, gratuitous posturings.The writing style is tedious and repetitive. Start reading paragraphs at random and they all sound pretty much the same. If this is supposed to represent the repetitive nature of obsession, it doesn't work. Instead, it is soporific.There is no momentum, neither forward, backward, nor sideward. The only movement in the story comes from physically turning the pages.The cover blurbs use words such as \"noir\", \"erotic\", \"scandal\" and \"obsession\" to describe the novel but there was no such substance to be found between the covers. Oh, sure, the narrator tells you that it is a tale of awakening lust and tragic obsession, but his promises don't deliver. Medical textbooks have more dramatic sexual descriptions than this thing does.Then there is the over-the-top sign off at the end. Without \"spoiling\" the pathetic final lines by quoting them, I don't think that the reader needs to be condescended to. I can't tell whether the author is intending to instruct mentally dense readers or whether she intended to create a warped sense of sympatico between author, reader, and characters by adding such self-aggrandizing drivel at the end.This is a book best suited for those with the mindset of the stereotypical, adolescent girl who hungers for doomed passions but settles for cheap romance novels while waiting for real life to come her way.[edited to fix typo]",

There is nothing uplifting or particularly enlightening about the novel. Boy (man) meets girl (woman) and falls passionately, erotically in love only the girl is his son's fiance and has no intention of breaking the engagement and neither does the boy. So, they continue their affair until it explodes in everyone's face.The thing is, there is nothing compelling about their affair, nothing warm or loving as most would see it. It's cold and passionate, if that's possible. And Hart suggest, absolutely necessary. For the man, Stephen, the affair is everything; it's the first time in his life that he is truly living (despite being fifty years old, a respected member of parliament, married with two children and a physician). Hart does an excellent job of capturing his emptiness but the emptiness doesn't go away when he meets Anna. Instead the passion creates fire but not fullness.Neither Anna or Stephen is appealing. They seem made for each other. They are like paper dolls going through life, feeling little and so excited when they do feel something that the feeling overpowers everything. This would be less shocking if they didn't suck everyone else into their desperation. The bad part is that Stephen ended up with Ingrid, his wife, and Martyn and Sally, his children. The family is the real victim, and I finished the novel thinking for what? What is it in Anna that made Stephen destroy everything? I didn't feel like I ever got an answer.Technically, the novel works. It is told from Stephen's perspective and stays basically true to his rather cold, distant and aloof personality. The ending to me is just odd. But then the whole book is odd so I guess I couldn't expect it to end other than odd. Anna is so unappealing that it's hard to know what Stephen sees in her. Perhaps this is part of the story line--this kind of passionate feeling is incomprehensible for those on the outside of it. It's a short book, but painful. The pain comes from watching the whole family go through the inevitable destruction. It's like watching a car wreck and not being able to do anything about it.",

You need to catch it young to survive and be innoculated the rest of your life. Adults can die of chickenpox or a broken heart. The book reads like a clinician's case study of a man who takes several months to destroy himself by sleeping with his son's fiance. He sees the end coming and wills it. Is he an evil man? His wife, on discovering his affair at first thinks not, then has second thoughts. Evil people take pleasure in the destruction of others or even of themselves. Readers must decide what pleasure the central character takes from the death and chaos he spreads.Stephen, the \"hero\" of the piece is a fifty year old high-achiever who falls for what psychiatrists today call a borderline personality woman. Doctors are taught to recognize borderlines by noting that after meeting one, one feels angry and confused and perhaps aroused to passion without being able to describe why. Ancient Greeks sent borderlines to be oracles. Borderlines don't smile much, utter mysterious phrases and seem in control while submitting to some doomed fellow. The 33 year old Anna Barton is the bordeline of Damage.It is hard to explain how Josephine Hart, the book's author could have so well caught the spirit of the borderline and the feelings of revulsion and dread such women provoke in normal women. Sensitive men with career prospects are the prey of borderlines and though such men usually go to ruin they count the experience of disintegration as the only time in their lives when they felt alive.Damage will seem incomprehensible to men who dated enough women and listened to enough romantic and mysterious nonsense to to send the Anna Bartons of the world on their way. Few women will like this book because it reminds them of how fragile marriage can be to a man of fifty who showed nothing but warmth and stability for 25 years.Josephine Hart's prose is simple and in a few lines can create memorable characters. Don't read this book if you are feeling low or just coming off a disruption in your romance.",

He is smart and successful with a loving family but he is slowly smothering from his life of routine. When Anna Barton comes along, he is drawn in by how different she is. Anna and Stephen begin a passionate affair quickly and it escalates with even more rapidity. They take more and more risks until finally, Martyn, Anna's fiance and Stephen's son, catches them. Obviously, the game is over and the characters disperse. Anna returns to the only person who can truly comfort her in times of crisis and Stephen loses the outwardly perfect life he once had.For the most part, this novel kept my undivided attention. I was able to finish it quickly and have read it several times since. Though other novels that deal with forbidden love have been recommended to me, I have not found any that I enjoy quite as much as _Damage_. True, the prose is sparse though not \"joined-up\" as one reviewer quipped. I am not put off by minimalism in literature or art so I found the unencumbered text to be refreshing.

As a married man, with a beautiful wife who I love immensely, I can appreciate the honesty that Stephen's character portrays. Despite my obvious fortune, I too can see the power another woman can yield. The gamble in itself is intoxicating yet frightful in its consequences. Though I don't know if I would ever give in to the struggle, I can see why Stephen ultimately does. The love he has for his perfect life and family are no match for the obsession he has for Anna. This book is much more than a story of one man's betrayal. It's beauty and value lie in the detail the pages reveal of the struggle itself -- The constant back and forth which engages a mind trying to rationalize and convince itself that it can cheat betrayal's ultimate fate. Even in it's darkness, this is ultimately a love story. And despite it's tragic end, I believe that Stephen comes to find himself.",

But in doing so Burke becomes a target for an entire Mafia family, a whore with a heart of cyanide, and a contract killer as implacable as a heat-seeking missile. Written with Vachss's signature narrative overdrive-and his unnerving familiarity with the sub-basement of American crime-Hard Candy is vintage Burke.",

                "review/text": "Hard Candy is the print version of an erotica e-book that contains three m&eacute;nage stories involving two males and one female. Only the first doesn't include homoerotic sex.Angela Knight's very short story \"Hero Sandwich\" plays in a world where super heroes are not unusual. The heroine is a former thief (forced by her vicious father) now turned paparazzi who is in lust with a super hero. She eventually has rather forceful sex with him and his brother and helps them catch her father's old colleague.While the story is not badly written it is simply too short for any character development or real storytelling. This is a short story intended to titillate. More for her fans than anyone else.The next story \"Candy for her Soul\" by Sheri Gilmore is a contemporary. It tells about a demon, Luke, who wants his human son, Nico, to find his heart's desire in the form of Natalie and David, both former classmates of his.The story is well written and engaging as long as you don't mind m&eacute;nage, m/m scenes and dominant elements. It is also long enough to get a feeling for the developing, sympathetic characters. Good erotic story.Morgan Hawke's \"Fortune's Star\" is the chef-d'uvre of this book and also the longest offering. The story plays in the same universe as her other \"Star\" sci-fi erotica novels but doesn't contain their very strong BDSM features; it has only a few.The genuine fortune-teller Luxi is on the way to her new and boring job. On Port Destiny Station she meets Leto, a cyborg housing a human spirit, and Amun, diplomat and telepath. Luxi becomes Amun's assistant and their lover. They defeat an evil spirit, and she decides to stay with the two men.This is one sensually erotic story! Morgan Hawke is an excellent writer who knows how to seamlessly combine sci-fi with erotica and a love story without ever losing her focus on the story. The world-building is thought-through and exciting, the characters are sexy, always true to how they are supposed to be and believable, and the sex is scorchingly erotic, the ideal combination. Ms. Hawke is a true storyteller with an immense talent for engaging the reader's mind and body.If you're in the mood for an erotic read to titillate the senses, the last story alone is enough to justify buying this book. All in all a very satisfying anthology.",

That said these stories are a bit scandalous and not for everyone. All of them are about menage a tois involving 2 men and one lucky woman. However, it's not all about the woman! Two of the stories highly involve male/male sexual situations, so be prepared that you may not feel comfortable with them.Hero Sandwich- Angela KnighA great story of a super stealthy camera toting ex-villainess and the two comic book type super hero's that she spies on. The brother duo decides to extract a little revenge and see just how far Paparazzi is willing to go for an exclusive. A very tasty treat with a happy ending!Candy For Her Soul-Sheri GilmoreOne of Satan's demons has started his own little southern family and after years of disinterest he decides his son should get everything he wants. That includes the TWO loves of his life. Bad boy Nico has been in love with geeky Natalie since they were little kids...unfortunately he showed it by tormenting her and Natalie fell in love with his bestfriend David. But David always wanted to be more than friends...This is a great, very well written love story. This is a bit explicit in the mens relationship and the love scenes were a bit rushed but as an all-around story it was great and I'd love to read more from this author.Fortune's Star-Morgan HawkeThe longest of the three offerings this is a futuristic, space thiller with characters who are genetically modified, psychic, or android/ghosts. It's well written with great love scenes and inventive but a bit confusing with the heroine having various tallents and wanting to be dominated but still wanting to be completely independant. That said it is still good and the whole book is worth the price!",

These books are so grim, so gritty. But in &quot;Hard Candy&quot; Burke is depressed and withdrawn from the events of the last book, so there is a whole new level of despair.

                "review/text": "\"Hard Candy\" is Andrew Vachss' fourth Burke novel, a sequel of sorts to \"Blue Belle,\" book three. Tackle \"Blue Belle\" first, if you're interested, for a richer, more comprehensive read.Burke, is in a deep funk after losing his woman. Before Belle died, she asked Burke to pay her debts. He does what she would have wanted. But he is still cold, empty, locked in an inner jail he can't walk out of. \"Once I could always find something on the sweet side of the edge I lived on. It was gone. Even in prison, there were some things you could laugh at. That was then.\" Vachss continues to reveal more of Burke's character, his grim inner world and his past in \"Hard Candy.\" He is one of the most complex protagonists I have encountered in popular fiction - edgy, dark, an outcast, as hard-boiled as they come, a scam artist who is a standup guy, a righteous man, and above all, a survivor. Burke, the man, and the strange folks who people his world and call him\" friend,\" are what make me a faithful fan and keep me hooked on the series.Word is out on the street that Burke, a sting artist, is now a gun for hire. There is heavy fallout from the rumor. The police hassle him and old friends, the kind he never wanted to see again, come out of the woodwork looking for him. First, Candy, an old flame from his reform school days, gives him a call - after all these years. \"Little Candy. A whore in her heart, even then. Just what I needed to cheer me up.\" Candy is still a working girl - we should all be so successful - with mega-upscale digs and a fortune invested in her face and body - silicon implants, face lift, collagen injections, electrolysis, colored contact lenses, a wig in every color, a department store's worth of clothes, make-up, furs - more Neiman Marcus than Macy's. Can she be funding herself? What's her scam? Her teenage daughter, Elvira, dropped out of school and is with a so-called cult in Brooklyn. Candy wants Burke to bring her girl home. He agrees to check things out. In Brooklyn he meets the charismatic, soft-spoken Train, who maintains a safe-house for kids. Elvira is a member of his tribe. But is Train the real deal? Are the teens safer with him than on the streets? Burke has his own suspicions.His involvement with Train reunites him with another acquaintance from his adolescence - Wesley, a killing machine, a robot with a resume of death to show for his life. Burke always wanted to be just like him, totally cold, emotional as ice. Wes warns Burke off his turf - he stepped over the line once, without knowing it, when he killed Mortay in \"Blue Belle.\" Now Burke's life is on the line if he messes with Wesley's work again. Just to make things interesting, the Mafia is also on his case. And Strega, the witch he wanted to forget, contacts him with a request.The usual suspects are all present, including: Max the Silent, a Mongolian warrior who calls Burke brother; Pansy is a warrior of another species - she's a Neapolitan mastiff and Burke's roommate; the Mole, a pasty-faced genius who lives in a bunker beneath a high-tech junkyard; the Prophet, a scam artist who speaks in rhyme; Mama Wong, group doyenne - a Chinese Jewish mother and restaurateur. She cares for the gang, takes Burke's messages, holds his stash and feeds him hot and sour soup; Michelle, a gorgeous transvestite who is about ready to go to Denmark for a life-changing operation; and the now famous souped-up Plymouth. \"The Mole makes sure to change the car's color after it is used on a job.\"As always Vachss narrative hits hard. His street tough dialogue and staccato-like prose lend authenticity to this raw, darker than noir world - a world where unspeakable horrors are perpetrated upon innocent children. The author, a leader in the child protective movement, calls it \"a war,\" and considers his writing as powerful a weapon as his litigation. He openly admits that he writes about the abuse of children because he wants to raise people's awareness of what's going on, and he'll reach a wider audience with fiction.This is a powerful novel - part of a superb series. Kudos to Andrew Vachss!JANA",

                "review/text": "Somehow, this book is even creepier than Flowers in the Attic. It's not as good, but it's a very entertaining read. After the abuse that the surviving Foxworth children suffered, readers will want to know if they can ever lead a normal life. It's a good examination of how a family might deal with the legacy of abuse if they've finally escaped from the perpetrators. Will they try to forgive and continue with their lives? Will they become obsessed with revenge? Or will they find themselves completely incapable of continuing with their lives because they were utterly emotionally destroyed?Each of the children deals with the trauma in different ways. While Chris appears to have recovered the best, his obsession with his own sister is the most startling and enduring result of his isolation during the \"Attic\" years. He does not \"give up\" waiting for his sister to respond to him romantically. Predictably, Carrie, who never really had a chance to enjoy life on the \"outside\", and who lost her twin at such a young age, is the most drastically scarred of the children and her story is the saddest and most tragic. She remains emotionally and physically stunted.For her, Cathy, and Chris, we remain riveted to the story and want to know what happens, because we suffered with them in \"Flowers\" and cried for little Cory. Now we want to know what happens to them even if a lot of the plot and secondary characters are boring and one-dimensional. I liked Henny,the warm nurse who cannot speak; even if one literary critic suggested the large black woman was reminiscent of \"Aunt Jemima\", I don't think that's fair. I think Andrews wrote her as a sensitive and intelligent woman, and including her gave us some respite from everyone in the story having \"flaxen hair and cerulean eyes\".Much weaker characters are Paul, who we are supposed to like because he takes in Chris, Cathy, and Carrie, but it's hard to like someone because he took in a beautiful fifteen year old girl who was orphaned out of the goodness of his own heart. I'm sorry, but the affair between him and Cathy was somehow even worse than that between Chris and Cathy, and very exploitive. The abandoned Cathy's gratitude toward Paul for taking in her and her siblings is something she feels she must repay sexually and Paul is ok with that despite being more than twice her age, rewarding the teenager with negligees etc. I'm not sure if Andrews wants us to find this exploitive or if we're supposed to sympathize with Paul. Her Ballet life is also an unwelcome diversion as are Julian and his mother. You can't figure out why someone as strong as Cathy, and as willful, would waste time with the abusive Julian, whose arrogance is ridiculous.The real center of the story, which make sense because she was the focal center of \"Flowers\" and the narrator of these two books, is Cathy's plans to resolve past injustices committed against her. She is mad with plans of revenge, which is understandable since Corrine, after what she did to Cory and then Carrie, is enjoying the life of luxury that was more important to her than her own children.This is the most thrilling aspect of the story and what we're reading it for, and these are the best scenes of the book. Everyone who read \"Flowers\" will enjoy when Cathy has an opportunity to confront her grandmother and mother. The best scene in the book is undoubtedly when Cathy, who is in her late twenties (Corrine was in her mid-thirties when this happened) dresses exactly as her mother did for the Christmas ball and looks, not surprisingly considering the lack of diversity in the Foxworth gene pool, every bit the double of her mother several years earlier.There are those at the party who saw Corrine years prior and immediately realize that something is terribly wrong when Cathy appears in that most dramatic scene, a great guilty pleasure. The ending is very haunting and sets the stage for the next book, suggesting the \"legacy of evil\" cannot be overcome.",

                "review/text": "&quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; was my first step into this genre, and I found it one of the best books I've read. I looked to &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; with great anticipation, but a short ways in, my enjoyment nearly flatlined.Bad points of the story:The story jumps around a bit too much, and what there is of the story seems to be too many people trying to get into Cathy's tutu. It seems half the time she's sobbing, a word used a bit too often throughout the book. And if she's not sobbing, someone is gripping her to them and telling her how exquisitely beautiful she is and that she belongs to him. Another annoying habit in the story is the placing of an exclamation mark behind Chris' name, as if Cathy is surprised her brother actually shows up. Chris himself doesn't seem to have much personality outside of studying and trying to convince his sister that his love for her isn't wrong, and if it is, oh well. Through some pieces of the story you have to wonder if Cathy left her brain in the attic. At one point I was so disappointed in Catherine, I really didn't want to finish the story, as she thought to herself &quot;Life seemed to me nothing without a man.&quot; Lastly, I felt there was excess character killing, with eight deaths (that I counted) throughout the story.Good points of the story:Carrie gets some more attention in the story, but it's mostly bittersweet. The only real redeeming part of the story was settled in the last fifty or so pages, with an excellent revenge set loose on the mother and grandmother. Which almost makes the rest of the story worth reading.In conclusion:Between &quot;I sobbed.&quot;, &quot;You're beautiful. You belong to me!&quot; and &quot;Chris!&quot;, the author manages to create a mildly entertaining story. But if I had it to do over again, I would have stopped at &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; and let my prior image of Cathy's character be.",

Despite the sequel being completely different from the work which came before, it retains the same spirit and tone.Chris, Cathy and Carrie have finally escaped the horrors of the attic... and yet life will not be simple for them, as the attic has left a harsh impression upon them. Chris finds it impossible to move beyond the unholy love born in the attic. Cathy burns with a desire for revenge against those who took so much from her. And Carrie... well, let's just say the fates aren't kind to poor Carrie.As with most of the early works by VC Andrews, the tone is most definitely gothic. The descriptions are lush and lavish, and lust often permiates the air... especially whenever nubile young Cathy, our narrator, begins speaking of her sensual exploits. To say that Cathy has a well-defined sense of self and sensuality would be an understatement, to be certain!Perhaps the best reason to read Petals On The Wind is to finally know the answer to the age-old question any good book (aka Flowers In The Attic) leaves the reader asking: What happened next?",

Hopes for a &quot;normal&quot; life outside of the attic appear hopeless as the hyperactive melodramatics and Catherine's heaving bosom narration drag on and on. The plasma parched girl is thristing for revenge but takes forever and a day to get around to it (this book would have been a short novel if she had done it sooner). What made the first book so good was its timelessness, the aura of a fairy tale gone horribly bad. In this book the characters move about a very real and time placed world and this weakens the book. While it may have its moments, they are so few and far between they don't merit looking for, and abuse is not a sign of true love. Soap opera fans might want to give it a look, others should skip it.",

I was astounded, how could I have missed such a deeply emotional, gripping story? Having eagerly read to the end and cheered at their freedom, I reached for the sequel and started to read...and boy did I wish I had stopped at book 1. Cathy, our protagonist, turns into the most feather-headed, sex obsessed victim I've ever seen. I could understand Paul (the whole gratitude thing) and I could see why she had the hots for Chris, (the whole attic thing) but Julian? From the strong, fairly mature character in the 1st book, she transforms into a petulant, whining, constantly crying version of her mother.VC Andrews should have stopped at FITA. Their lives slipped from drama to melodrama and Cathy (who was the only sane voice in the FITA) turns into a throughly dependent, foolish bitch. The book stumbles from crisis to crisis, with half the cast dying and Cathy moving in with her brother, who can't seem to get over his 'love' for her. I was so disappointed that I read it in bits and ignored most of the book. Read FITA but leave the rest on the shelf.",

                "review/text": "With the glut of teen-geared, posthumously-published, ghostwritten V.C. Andrews paperbacks that have been flooding the book world of late, it might be easy to forget that Virginia Andrews had the ability to create wrenching drama and unique characters who struggle to open the door to happiness even when the key is placed right in their hands.In \"Petals on the Wind\", the second volume of a five-book series, the three remaining \"flowers in the attic\" - Cathy, Christopher and Carrie Dollanganger - escape Foxworth Hall and certain death by poisoning at the hands of their gold-digging mother.As they heal, Chris, the sunshine of Cathy's heart, continues to try and care for his sisters while pursuing his dream of becoming a doctor. Through Cathy's adoring eyes, the reader sees him grow into a man who is handsome, protective and giving, with the flaws of an occasional temper and an inability - and unwillingness - to love any woman except his younger sister, who yearns to be a prima ballerina.And it's here that the book hits a snag - in Cathy's tortured relationship with her ballet partner Julian, a selfish brat who beats her, cheats on her and allows her no privacy. Given the singular experiences she has endured, it is plausible that Cathy would be torn between her love and gratitude for Dr. Paul Sheffield, the man who takes the children in and becomes their guardian angel, and her forbidden adoration for her brother Chris.However, it seems unfathomable that Julian, whom Cathy accurately calls a \"nasty, inconsiderate brute\", would fit into the equation. She and have both fiery natures and good physical chemistry that allows them to dance well together, but Cathy has been written to have too much fierce self-preservation (if not self-esteem) to put up with such horrendous treatment.A little more understandable is Cathy's later passion for Bart Winslow, the stepfather who never knew she existed. After all, her infatuation for him has slept inside her since she was fifteen and came across him dozing in Foxworth Hall's infamous Swan Room.V.C. Andrew's books are not for everyone. Readers who want stoic realism and sensible characters that find it easy to live by society's rules might have a hard time swallowing these stories. Some of their events are as fantastic of those that unwound in the soap operas Chris and Cathy watched while locked up in Foxworth Hall. Also, Cathy's deep romantic feelings for her brother, her mother's husband and the man who becomes her surrogate father might certainly be disturbing to some.But for fans who enjoy the struggles of Andrews's characters to find inner peace, artistic fulfillment and true love, \"Petals on the Wind\" is undoubtedly one of the best choices.",

For new readers, i suggest reading \"Flowers in the Attic\" prior hand to understand why Catherine had that much fury buried withing her, leading her to series of uncalculated bad choices but only to prep her up to face who she felt was responsible for all the trauma she and her siblings faced. This book will leaves you turning pages until you reach the end, which of course, leaves you wondering for more.The pages started from where they left of, on their way away from their hell home known as the Foxworth Hall on a bus. A chance meeting with Henny, the black woman, who bring them to the hospital when Carrie suddenly turn to the worse, where he introduced them to Paul, her doctor son; who welcome them all into his large home, share with Henny.Paul send them off to the their own perpective schools to further their education, sending both Chris and Carrie away to boarding school and Cathy to attend ballerina school in the same town, only to be together again every weekends.Even though years passes by, the trauma inflicted onto them while they were back in Foxworth Hall leaves a scar deep enough for Cathy to persue vengence against her mother. Carrie was still mourning for her lost twin, Cory and couldn't grow properly after being poisoned by their own mother. The same scar that lead Chris who still long for Cathy; the same scar that lead Cathy to fall in love harshly with Paul and Julian, the ballet dancer she met that brought them both up to fame as they partnered together and who also became her first husband, and the same scar that left Carrie with the feeling that she was a terrible sin to exist. everything wrong happened in their life, Cathy default blame on her mother, who loves mother more than her own children.Cathy took vengence by proxy, making sure her mother's new husband, Bart Winslow fall for her. Her mother, Corrine, of course, deserved nothing less than what was her fate in this book, after the revelations of her dark secret spilled open for the world to see.",

                "review/text": "Reading this book was like watching a car accident in super extra slow millisecond by millisecond slow motion. Petals in the Wind is excrutiatingly repetitive in its dialogue, narration, and plot.The book dragged on and on, repeating the same coda. It may have made a decent short story but it could not sustain itself over 400+ pages. As for the characters, Catherine makes a particularly unsympathetic protagonist. In the first novel, it was refreshing to have a flawed main character as trashy novels usually make them out to be perfect, but in Petals on the Wind, her flaws were so deep I wished for her to meet the same fate as her many lovers. Vain, self-centered, needy, bitter, and angry--why any man would fall in love with her is beyond understanding. In addition, the scenes between her and her brother were nothing short of nauseating. To compare this book to the far superior Flowers in the Attic, in that novel there was a compelling reason as to why two confused children would be drawn together by their burgeoning sexuality, trapped in a attic with no one but each other, their hormones, and their two younger siblings which they \"parented\". In this novel, there is no understandble reason other than Catherine's vanity for she kept leading her brother on. The characters are untrue to life, and the dialogue is stilted and overdramatic. In gothic novels you do have to suspend some reality, but this novel was so unrealistic as to be laughable.If it was so bad, why did I continue reading? I ask myself the same question. To use the car accident analogy again, it was horrible but I had to keep looking simply to see how it would play out. Do yourself a favor and don't pick it up so you don't end up ensnared in that inane book like I did. I wish I had been warned--I believed all the positive reviews here and I was so disappointed. Read Flowers in the Attic and use your imagination as to what happens to the Dollanganger children once they escaped. Anything you can imagine is better than the trash in this book.",

It has drama, suspense, romance, and enough plot twists to keep the most savvy reader breathlessly reading until the heart-wrenching conclusion.William Kane and Abel Rosnovski both enter the world in 1906. One is born to a wealthy, socially prominent Boston family. The other is born in poverty in Poland to an unwed woman who dies during childbirth. They each have a remarkable life story that makes for spellbinding reading until the finale in 1963.Abel is rescued from the woods beside the body of his dead mother by a hunter and taken into a peasant family. The Russian occupation of Poland, his fearful and solitary escape to Turkey and later America, will have you cheering this tough young boy.Meanwhile, young William Kane is growing up in the lap of luxury, attending the finest schools, and winning every honor his father before him achieved.You will be fascinated by Archer's storytelling and the vivid characters he portrays. You will root for Abel and take him to your heart. You will be fascinated with William and wish only the best for him. Unfortunately, when the two characters cross paths as young men, a fierce hatred erupts and they become life-long enemies, as Abel swears to destroy William Kane.The author has made each of his main characters so endearing that the reader is torn and loyalties falter. Do you root for Abel? Do you root for William? Dare you hope they will work this out? Whatever you are thinking, you will be surprised. This is not one of those novels where you will see the ending coming, but you will be stunned, sad, and uplifted as a gamut of emotions play with your mind and heart.I finished this late last night and have been thinking about Abel and William all day. I can hardly wait to start on the sequel, &quot;The Prodigal Daughter.&quot;",

Jeffrey Archer put the action in the real world with a knowledge of the reality of Poland before the second war and the post war era. This is what I like about it. Since I am Polish I can say that the fact from the begining of Abel's life are set in the reality of those time. The Russian soldiers were shown in the actual reality what I know from the facts that my father was telling me about them. Anyway the characters of Abel and Kane are drawn nicely to shaw thedrive to success. Kane is driven by the financial purpooses to get rich by all means, while Abel's success is driven by his stubborness to destroy Kane who was gilty of dead of Abel's former boss. The action of this book is swift, and is very characteriscal to all books of Jeffrey Archer. Second part of this book &quot;The Prodigal Daugther&quot; is in the same style. I highly recomend to everyone this book, and of course when you read &quot;Kane &amp; Abel&quot; do not forget to read &quot;The prodigal daughter&quot; to have the full picture of Kane's family.",

Marika is in a world of hurt. No relationship has ever lasted-except for an occasional loveless liaison with a woman named Cass, who uses Marika cruelly.Rhiannon \"Rhi\" Davies lives a hardscrabble existence in a shabby part of town. She rents a room from her mean-spirited aunt who took Rhi in at age ten when the girl's parents died. For years, Rhi has dreamed of escape from the critical, loveless aunt. Since getting a paralegal certificate, she's saved every penny she can, planning and scheming to get out of her situation. Rhi enters Marika's work life by taking a temporary paralegal job when the regular employee goes on maternity leave. Marika and Rhi have almost nothing in common-except for their lack of faith in themselves or that they are worthy of love.When Rhi is attacked and badly injured by a crazed man in the office, Marika is shocked into compassion. She takes Rhi into her home and cares for the convalescing young woman, and against all odds, the two women are drawn to one another.This might be a typical romance except for two things. First of all, the writing is exquisite. Every scene, every character, every detail is described with loving care. The secondary characters, especially the kindly priest, the mean aunt, and several helpful friends, are well-drawn. Secondly, the story doesn't end with the two women gaining rapport and falling in love. Instead, Marika's past comes back to haunt them, dragging them into danger and near death. The story ends up being more than a typical romance and is, in fact, a cross-genre thriller.Told with a deft touch by a talented writer, BROKEN FAITH is an exhilarating story that gains power the further the reader gets into it. There are so many twists and turns along the way, most of them unexpected, and the suspense grows gradually as the reader becomes aware of the breadth of the plot. Simply put, this is a terrific book, and I recommend it highly.-...",

One of the nice things is that it's longer, so the characters and the story have a real chance to develop. Don't let the length put you off though. Because the story is so interesting, the pages fly by. You meet Marika and Rhiannon, two women from very different positions in life who share a common trait. Because of the psychological wounds they suffered growing up, neither one of them believes that they are capable of finding or being loved. Another nice trait in this book is that, for those of you who've read a lot of recent lesbian literature, these characters are not Xena makeovers. No, tall dark blue-eyed beauty with a short blonde sidekick. One is tall and the other shorter and that's about the end of the simularities. As these two are drawn together through their work lives first, you will get to meet a rich assortment of supporting characters, including David, the Episcopal priest who is willing to accept that what Jesus taught about love and what the church says may not be the same thing, and Lee, the female private investigator, who will do anything to keep her family and friends safe. And yes, there are bad guys in this story, but they make the story richer. Events unfold as Rhi and Rika meet, slowly form a friendship, and are drawn into a sinister situation, while they realize slowly that they're becoming more than friends. The question that hangs over the book as events develop is if these two women, who have been so damaged by others, can let their defenses down enough to see the love that is available to each one.

Rhiannon &quot;Rhia&quot; Davies is a lonely, socially inept outcast, counting her pennies until she can get the hell out of dodge. Through a series of events, Rika attempts to bring Rhia out of her shell and into her totally screwed up life. Mixed in with the elemental drama of lesbian relationships is an international human smuggling ring with ties to the Chinese Triad. While the &quot;Rhia&quot; and &quot;Rika&quot; monikers were a bit much to get used to (I started getting confused about which one was which!), the Triad and smuggling ring subplot was really &quot;out there&quot; and didn't fit with the tone of the book's relationship focus. While understanding the need for something or someone to be the &quot;bad guy,&quot; since this is a mystery, I think the author could have eliminated the smuggling ring, focused on the relationship more, and had a much more satisfying book. The supporting cast of characters were great! From the understanding Episcopal priest, David, to the best friend, Lee, and her girlfriend, Dana, you get a warm feeling of people who truly care about these two. Get ready to snuggle in with this one, as it weighs in at 437 pages!",

As the women get closer, they begin to question what is really important in their respective lives. Marika learns what it means to open up and care for someone else. Rhi learns how to trust and love. On top of their relationship, the women find themselves in the midst of a dangerous criminal situation, once again in need of Lee's help.Hart masterfully combines wretched pasts, promising futures, and a frightening present into a wonderful novel well worth reading.

Beware of her. Mind her. Death guards her like one of its own.\" The day Fatima forgot her name, Death paid a visit. From hereon in she would be known as Sankofa-a name that meant nothing to anyone but her, the only tie to her family and her past. Her touch is death, and with a glance a town can fall. And she walks-alone, except for her fox companion-searching for the object that came from the sky and gave itself to her when the meteors fell and when she was yet unchanged; searching for answers. But is there a greater purpose for Sankofa, now that Death is her constant companion?",

Rescuing the only surviving member of the massacre a seven-year-old shell shocked little girl called Kelly, Nick goes on the run, and finds out that even friends are potential enemies in a world of IRA deals, drug cartels and messy TransAtlantic politics. This is a knuckle bitingly good book and I spent the whole of an evening reading it from cover to cover. Andy McNab is as good a writer of fiction as he is of fact. I liked his hero because it showed the man to be human and not just a killing machine as SAS soldiers are often portrayed in many novels. I hope that McNab thinks of writing a sequel to REMOTE CONTROL as Nick Stone and Kelly make quite a formidable team. A big thumbs up for this cracker of a first novel.",

                "review/text": "Andy McNab's first thriller is a top-notch combination of violent action,pulse-pounding excitement and edge of your seat suspense.In \"Remote Control\" McNab introduces a new hero, Nick Stone, who makes mostother famous fictional heroes look like prancing twits (can you say \"Dirk Pitt\"?) Anex-SAS operator and current deniable ops specialist for Britain, Stone is somethingof a cross between Hammett's Continental Op and Alistair MacLean's PhillipCalvert: tough as jacketed hollow points, totally on-task, and cunning enough tobeat the bad guys at their own game. Nick Stone has more life in him (and moreblood and soul) than any action hero this side of Pendleton era Mack Bolan.The action in \"Remote Control\" never lets up for more than a few pages, and evenwhen Stone isn't facing guns and fists he's deep into the task at hand and planning2 or 3 moves ahead so that the pace just keeps up and the tension builds.Stone has to work against a plot without any help after he finds the family of afriend murdered. On the run and out in the cold with his friend's seven year olddaughter in tow, Stone uses his training, intelligence and toughness to bestadvantage. And just when he's past one challenge, an even greater one confrontshim. The story is told in first person and it really sounds like authentic dialogue.This is like the golden age of Len Deighton's spy writing but with a tougher andmore realistic hero. Hard-boiled stuff!The great relationship between childless Stone and seven year old Kelly is awonderful thing in this book. I think I worried as much for him when he had tofinally tell Kelly her family was dead as when he was in any of the many deadlyencounters in the story. McNab obviously knows something about children andKelly's character is so real it makes the reader very frightened for her safety.The cover quote from author Stephen Coonts claims McNab is \"the best suspensethriller writer. . . since Alistair MacLean\" and I can't argue with that. This book waseverything you'll want in a thriller. I can't wait to start the next one!This is a 5 star effort if ever there was one. Read it.",

Overall this book is entertaining, with more action than recent vintage Clancy novels. The action is often quite intense and, in those moments, it is a real page turner. The technical and tradecraft details are what really make this book. McNab, or course, is all the more believable in these areas due to his personal experiences as relayed in his non-fiction work. He buys a credibility there that Clancy, et al. just can't match. Worth reading for that fact alone.While the story is good and the details better, the writing itself is sometimes clumsy. Maybe this is nitpicking, since the reality is that the writing somehow seems to &quot;fit&quot; the story (you wouldn't want Steinbeck or Hemingway telling the story, would you?). However, I suspect that the writing is simply due to first novel syndrome (I had no complaints about his writing in Bravo Two Zero), and would expect this to improve in future works.Although I only gave the book 3 stars, I'll definitely keep McNab on my &quot;read&quot; list.",

Ex-SAS 'K' Nick Stone is assigned to follow a group of Provisional IRA members on their way to Washington. His mission is cut short, but before leaving, he decides to visit a friend's family. At this point, McNab plunges the reader into a rollercoaster ride of emotions as Stone finds the family savagely murdered. From there on, the action does not stop - Stone finds himself and 7-year-old Kelly, the family's only survivor, pursued by mysterious forces intent on capturing them both. An array of supporting characters add to the drama - 'Slack' Pat the ex-SAS drug addict, Al De Niro the ex-mobster, Euan the best friend, and more. Stone himself is a brilliant creation, a hero with a sizeable share of ruthlessness - you can't help but wonder how much of McNab is in Stone. Remote Control creates a world which is brutal, thrilling and shockingly realistic - quite simply one of the best books you'll find.",

While on what is termed a &quot;deniable assignment&quot;, Nick contacts a former SAS colleague, only to find upon his arrival at their home that Kev and his family have been brutally murdered. All but one.... their seven year old daughter Kelly.This story never loses its pace. Nick and Kelly are on the run from people trying to kill them at every turn. But it's the growing relationship between Nick and Kelly that I find truly memorable.At first Nick tries his best to protect the young girl from the forces closing in on them, only to slowly find himself growing to rely on Kelly with every turn of the page.I totally agree that this is a &quot;can't put down&quot; novel. Your heart will race at the clever twists and turns McNab has crafted. The supporting cast of characters are highly developed. From the dangerous IRA hitmen, to Stone's British employers at The Firm, to fellow SAS members Pat and Euan, all the way to the federally relocated mobster Big Al DeNiro. Each is a living, breathing character adding to the tension and brilliant storyline!This is a novel that begs a sequel so readers can see what further developments take place between Nick and Kelly.

McNab is not quite as arrogant, but nevertheless, special forces must grow an in-your-face attitude.I particularly enjoyed the detailed observations and the reasoning behind the tradecraft actions. What's Nick Stone, the hero, doing looking inside a fire extinguisher? What's he going to make with the kitchen supplies? One always gets a bit more involved when the writing not only entertains but also educates.The relationship with Kelly also moves the story. Surely a SAS operative would have problems with relating to a seven year old but by the end of the book, it's quite believable how they have grown attached.I had only a couple of minor irritants. McNab's British background is evident as expected. However, some actions would get different reactions in the US. I can't believe a British citizen wouldn't draw more attention with an American child in tow. Particularly with the scratches and cuts gathered along the way during the characters romp through the seedy side of America. Who from England would want to stay in a hotel in the warehouse district?Also, as some of the other reviewers pointed out, the story is somewhat predictable. Even I could tell early in the book who the ultimate villans had to be. Nevertheless, REMOTE CONTROL was an enjoyable way to spend the weekend.",

If you are in the same age group, regardless of where you grew up, I think you will relate to much of the story. If you are not in this age group, the baby boomers, I still believe you will enjoy the story and perhaps learn a lot about the way things used to be. One thing I can say for sure- historically speaking, it was very accurate and must have entailed a lot of research by the arthor.I especially liked the tenderness in the way the characters treated each other. It made me feel that the people in this story really loved and cared for each other, regardless of race, class, wealth, or station in life.

They are so real, so vivid, you will think that you actually know them. I also was happily surprised at the downright kneeslapping humor at times.

Don't look for some profound moral discovery about human nature, or some great social or political statement. That's not what this book is about.

It is a love triangle among Josh Adams, a struggling young mechanic and ex-hobo, Elizabeth Butler, a beautiful, well-to-do, refined visitor from Raliegh, North Carolina, and Lula Mae Jackson, the little black girl who grew up in a log cabin behind the store where Josh works, and is now a teenager with a crush on Josh.Also, there is the 35 year old virgin, Shake Merriweather, half Cherokee and half British, the wealthiest man around and his romance with Charleen Bean, Elizabeth's cousin, and the subtler, more mature romance between the elder town doctor/preacher, Jonas Rucker and Grace Bean, Charleen's mother.

The blend is reminiscent of such late-20th-century treasures as The Accidental Tourist, The World According to Garp, or A Confederacy of Dunces.\"-Denver Post The year is 1950, and in a small town on Cape Cod twenty-six-year-old librarian Peggy Cort feels like love and life have stood her up. Until the day James Carlson Sweatt- the \"over-tall\" eleven-year-old boy who's the talk of the town-walks into her library and changes her life forever. Two misfits whose lonely paths cross at the circulation desk, Peggy and James are odd candidates for friendship, but nevertheless they soon find their lives entwined in ways that neither one could have predicted.

Had I read her novel before I'd heard it so highly touted, I might have enjoyed it a little more...but maybe only a little. I do not agree with the many reviewers who praise her writing style; the book is almost absurdly overwritten in a great many places: &quot;I loved him because I wanted to save him, and because I could not. I loved him because I wanted to be enough for him, and I was not.&quot; Admittedly, there were some wonderful lines as well, but just not enough to make up for the those that sound straight out of &quot;Bridges of Madison County.&quot;I also agree with the reviewers who noted that the book spends far too much time on Peggy and not nearly enough on James (or really any of the other characters). Everyone but Peggy came across as somewhat &quot;flat.&quot; At many points in the story I started to wonder if Peggy wasn't meant to be an &quot;unreliable narrator&quot; -- that is, that we were supposed to see her love for James as truly unbalanced in a way that she herself can't see. James is intriguing but just not fleshed out enough as a character for me to see why Peggy should be so obsessed with him. I really wanted to like Peggy -- it's so seldom that quiet, bookish characters get to be the center of novels -- but most of the time I did not, not because any of her &quot;faults&quot; (such as her straightforward declaration that she is not a lover of mankind), but, ironically, because I felt that McCracken tried too hard to make us like Peggy and to force us to see Peggy's point of view as a justified one.",

TurpinThis amazing novel takes place in a New England tourist town where summers are unimportant: \"In the dark privacy of winter Brewsterville's citizens were more likely to drink, weep, have affairs, tell off-color jokes, let themselves go.\" Similarly, the book's protagonist and narrator, Peggy Court, is a woman who lives silently, in the darkness of her own self-hatred. What makes this book captivating and upbeat is that Court finds her way out of her own darkness, and she does it by forging paths few others would imagine. \"I wanted,\" the character says, \"to out-Houdini Houdini, but in reverse. I wanted not to escape, but to enter, to insinuate myself into the smallest places in that house ... I wanted to get myself so caught they'd have to let me stay. Look, they'd say, how did she manage that? That space isn't big enough for anyone. Look at her: she's surely trapped.\"McCracken is a rare combination: she writes like a poet, but has a gift for illustrious, fascinating characters. Her first-person narrator is so vivid and constant, that despite her obvious shortsightedness, you very quickly find yourself perceiving the universe unself-consciously through her eyes. Peggy Court is a woman so hollowed out by loneliness that even socks seem lucky to her because \"Socks mate for life.\" She sees herself as unlovable, and describes herself as waiting for love \"as though I were a pin sunk deep in a purse, waiting for a magnet to prove me metal.\" She is also a person oblivious to her rare ability to dismiss flaws in others and to value them despite their quirks: She warms to another woman because \"I've always found a certain sullenness comforting,\" and says of her, \"Even now I remember Mrs. Sweatt as the embodiment of every sad love song ever written; she believed every musical statement of what love did to you when it went wrong, how it was like a poison without an antidote, how you'd never breathe right again. Most people feel that way only when the music plays; all her days, Mrs. Sweatt's heat was tuned to some radio frequency crammed with tragedy.\"None of the characters in this novel are important people - and none of them are ordinary. First of all, there's the giant, James Sweatt, who accepts his life-threatening condition with alternate offerings of resignation and anger, whose gigantism renders him frequently homebound, and who consequently is someone who \"loved what you could get through the mail. Eventually he had dozens of degrees from correspondence schools and was a mail-order minister several times over.\" McCracken never lets her pen slip - she brings every character vividly to life. Even the lesser characters seem destined to stay with you permanently.McCracken has a flair for rich dialogue, and this is nowhere more evident than in those passages where she allows the minor characters Leila (a chance encounter from a circus, the smallest woman in the world), and James's father, Mr. Sweat, to talk themselves into existence. A Giant's House is full of profound, seemingly casual reflections on the nature of love, and Mr. Sweat, who abandoned his son in childhood, and thus describes himself ruefully as \" the opposite of an orphan,\" tells us about himself: \"[P]eople become immune to love the way they become immune to any disease. Either they had it bad early in life, like chicken pox, and that's that; or they keep getting exposed to it in little doses and build up an immunity; or somehow they just don't catch it, something in `em is born resistant. I'm the last type. I'm immune to love and poison ivy.\"McCracken is a writer to watch - she surely deserved to be named by Granta as one of the 20 Best Young American Novelists, and this book heartily merited its nomination for the National Book Award.",

When I first read the back of the book, I was intrigued by its original concept. A librarian and the world's tallest boy? Subtitled A Romance? I feared that it could be one of those books that tries so hard to be quirky, but ends up turning its characters into caricatures that we can't identify with and losing us with its twisted plotlines, all in the name of originality. This is not the case with The Giant's House. Both Peggy and James, as well as some of the minor characters like James' mother, captured my heart. A previous reader described the narrative as &quot;quiet&quot; and I find that word is particularly fitting. The parts that move you aren't flashy, or filled with action, but are careful, truthful depictions of life's sadnesses and joys. While it's true that we have more insight into Peggy (due to the first-person narration), there are several scenes that let us into James' huge shoes, giving us just a glimpse of what it might like to be the world's tallest boy--I'm thinking of the wedding dance and the feet scene especially. The ending put me off a little on first reading, but subsequent readings make me realize that I, like Peggy, didn't want to let James go.

It made me strangely uncomfortable reading it due to its subject matter (obssessing over a young disabled boy), but I wanted to finish it. My major problem with it was the depiction of the main character; someone that I call a &quot;libarian.&quot; A mousy, anti-social wierdo who can't communicate like the rest of the human race; a spinster who will never marry because she's hiding in the library all the time. As a former librarian, I felt that Ms. McCracken could have taken the opportunity to portray a character unlike the typical stereotype. Conveniently, the book takes place in the 50's so she had an easy excuse for not describing the real work as a library director in the year 2000. You most certainly need people skills! Perhaps I'm being a little harsh, but if you read of your profession in this dim and narrow light, I'm sure it would bother you just as much.",

                "review/text": "I thought the underlying story of this novel was creative and brimming with possibilities. Peggy, a dowdy, lonely librarian who &quot;does not love mankind&quot; is the narrator. She writes of her attraction to and ultimate short-live love affair with James Sweatt, a &quot;giant&quot; who grows to be 8 feet 7 inches tall and is some 14 years her junior. She meets him when he enters her library with his elementary school and requests a book on magic. Attracted to his quiet dignity and pitying his already massive size, Peggy begins a friendship with James, which later turns to love as she becomes involved with his troubled mother and family.What a fantastic idea for a book! However, for some reason, this books promise was never fully realized. I felt as though Peggy's characterization as a misanthrope was overdone and insincere; the author repeatedly tells us that Peggy hates people, yet she practically moves right in with James's family, whom she hardly knows. Furthermore, the author does not follow through enough on what could have been a wonderful scene in which James declares his love for Peggy. McCracken, while going for understated, wavers dangerously close to boring.Nevertheless, the characterization of James, his mother, and his quirky Aunt Caroline are wonderful. The ending of this story is a pleasant surprise that made up for a lot of the story's overly slow pace. Overall a wonderfully imagined plot that had the ingredients for a wonderful novel. I expect great things from this author in the future.",

        "description": "War is raging throughout France. Rose is in late pregnancy and alone at the family chateau, her husband having been sent off to fight. Enemy soldiers come upon her and see her as an easy target; they rape and beat her and leave her for dead. And there in her agony, she gives birth to a boy, Alexandre. But the child will not be like other children. Warped and deformed by the kicks and punches she had suffered at the hands of her rapists, he is born with crippled legs. His doting religious mother tries to alleviate his despair as he grows older, but he is a physical and spiritual wreck, and he takes his frustrations out on his mother and God. His healthy younger brother Gustave grows up to be everything that Alex wants to be but cannot due to the limitations of his condition. They hate each other. Alex falls madly in love with his brother's lover, but will she return his feelings? Can she too overlook his crippled condition and be serious about him? This deeply moving story is one young broken man's search for physical and spiritual healing through the power of love. David Rehak was born in what is today the Czech Republic, but was raised and educated in Canada. His first published book was a controversial and well-acclaimed novel titled A Young Girl's Crimes and originally written at age 21. This was followed by Love and Madness. Dave has recently returned to the country of his birth, where he teaches English while keeping up with his literary pursuits.",

                "review/text": "David Rehak's books are never a clone of the familiar genre fiction we find on shelves these days. His writing style is reminscent of the 19th century and very European in flavor. Rehak's work is different, his topics off center just enough to add a sense of intriguing unpredictablity into the read. This third book by David Rehak, while a different subject, clearlyreflects his unique voice as writer.The setting of Crippled Dreams is rural France in the 1870s. The Prussians have swept through the bucolic countryside, raping and destroying as they go. Rose Petit is one of their helpless victims. Eight months pregnant, with her husband fighting away from home, she's set upon by four Prussiansoldiers bent on claiming Rose and her farm as spoils of war. When Rose defies them, they beat her mercilessly and leave her for dead. Her first born son is physically damaged from the beating and born paralyzed in both legs.Rose loves her crippled son, Alexandre, and lavishes him with mother love from birth. Even when her husband Paul returns from war and a second son, Gustave, is born, Alexandre receives the lion's share of her love and attention. Through such loving attentions, Rose hopes her crippled son's soul will be made fine, if not his ruined body.As Alexandre ages, his bitterness and hopeless rage increase incrementally. He silently observes the world around him, filled with healthy, happy people with unimpaired bodies, and curses a God who picks and chooses who He blesses. He blasphemes God at every opportunity and refuses to believeRose's assurances of a loving Heavenly Father. His feelings of resentment come to full flower when Gustave starts courting Marie-Anne Godard. Marie-Anne is a beauty, with billows of dark hair and flashing eyes that reveal a captivating spirit.Alexandre dreams of finding true love with his brother's fiancee but accepts her loyal friendship as a poor substitue. When Gustave discovers that Alexandre and Marie-Anne have become close friends, his temper sets off a situation that ends in horrible tragedy. In the aftermath, nothing can be done to lessen Alexandre's despair. Only God's grace and mercy can heal a crippled body, mind, and spirit, but can a loving God reach Alexandre?David Rehak takes common situations and transforms them to uncommon through his use of words and his development of interesting characters. If you are tired of the same old genre fiction, check out Crippled Dreams.Laurel JohnsonMidwest Book Review",

                "review/text": "\"Crippled Dreams\" is a love story but it is also a story of conflicts. It begins with the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. After a pregnant French woman was brutally attacked by four Prussian soldiers, she gives birth to a son, Alexandre, who is paralyzed from the thigh down. Throughout his formative years Alexandre takes some solace in books but by the time he is in his early twenties he is embittered and frustrated, totally dependent, yet desperate for life experience. He can only watch with envy and resentment as his younger brother Gustave reaps rewards. Gustave is equally resentful of Alexandre, jealous of all the attention lavished on him by his pious, over-protective mother Rose, who is torn by guilt.While Rose is deeply religious, Alexandre finds it hard to believe in a Saviour that has left him the way he is. Nevertheless he dutifully goes to church, where the minister urges his congregation to accept that a happy, full life is not to be found in the acquisition of material goods and short-term pleasures. Fame and fortune are meaningless. Faith and spirituality are far more rewarding in the long run. (This is an appropriate point to recommend the non-fiction book \"Status Anxiety\" by Alain de Botton.) Those who appear to have everything are in actual fact plastic and superficial, lacking the fundamental qualities that make it possible to live a truly satisfying life. The minister explains what those qualities are more fully.The conflict between the two brothers is intensified with the arrival of Marie-Anne, who, to Alexandre's disappointment and heartbreak, is betrothed to Gustave. Alexandre is convinced Marie-Anne is making a grave mistake, not marrying because of love, but to fulfill an obligation to society.Another conflict in \"Crippled Dreams\" is that of science and religion. For much of the book Alexandre maintains his scepticism, finding more credibility in the cold logic of science. Rose is desperate for Alexandre to accept God's love in order to save his soul. Alexandre is an agnostic who half hopes that there is an afterlife, because it would make all the senseless misery in the world, the suffering endured throughout history, worthwhile and meaningful. There is a comfort in believing that the life we live in this world is merely a preparation for the eternal life of the next world.Are we supposed to choose religion over science, or can we accept both? It is a telling point that \"Crippled Dreams\" is set in the late 19th century. In the century that has passed since Alexandre's time, the world has become increasingly secular as science has achieved much that was once considered impossible. Today there is talk about stem cell research, a subject considered controversial by many, but having the potential to wipe out needless anguish. How would Alexandre have felt about it if he had lived in our time? If God made us in His image, giving us the knowledge to learn, grow and progress, it wouldn't be sacrilegious to perform our own miracles, would it?I think I'm starting to ramble now so I'll conclude by saying that \"Crippled Dreams\" is a very thought-provoking book. Very well written.",

                "review/text": "I can see this novel as a movie, sort of in the vein of Forrest Gump or Sling Blade, but different. The main character of the story named Alex makes it to heaven, but first he must go through hell and back.The thing about Rehak's writing is that he's a storyteller, a brilliant storyteller. The kind of story one tells around a campfire. A real good story, a real story in the traditional sense of the word. He's not a great stylist, he won't wow you with a poetic or experimental writing style. He throws all that out the window, and instead, chooses the most clear and straightforward narrative imaginable, tightly written and fast-paced. But it's important not to read too fast and miss anything because it's all so tied together, never anywhere a superfluous paragraph, the plotline is never padded out and distracted by boring or unimportant incidents. Everything has a direct or deeper symbolic significance. Interestingly, his characters are not the main attraction, it is the story itself that takes center stage. His characters are almost simply a by-product of the story. This approach I think is quite new, or at least in the way it's done here. Today, most authors let the story evolve from the main character and the psychology of character study is key. But in Rehak's minimalistic, barebones plot-driven style, it's the other way around, characterization evolves out of the plot. I think this is very interesting, although some readers will prefer that he beef out his characters some more. But he has interesting characters, and some of the best plots I've read.He has 4 books out in 2 years. From what I've read and from what I gather, I wonder if in his eagerness to be published, Rehak did himself an injustice by giving his first books to the first publisher to offer publication rather than wait out for the kind of publisher that would bring his work out into the public eye more and do his books justice. I hope the public at large will catch up with this innovative rising talent.",

                "review/text": "I enjoyed Crippled Dreams. Rehak is certainly not afraid of the big themes. I liked the start and the build-up. The author is taking things slower, and allowing for more development and more reflection, which I think is good. He uses short, brightly-lit scenes, all very pointed and purposeful, so that a kind of impressionistic mosaic emerges which charts the growth of Alexandre's feeling of rejection, resentment and jealousy, which are at the heart of his bitterness and his loss of humanity. The same technique is most effective in communicating the growth of his love and ultimately his death and salvation. I also liked the intense, ominous, brooding effect the short scenes create. In the same way, the style, understated at important points, creates a mood of other-worldly fatality which is finally dispersed by the luminous way the ending is handled.Just one thing. I know the author uses broad brush strokes here, for the brevity and intensity of his story-telling technique depend on the kind of stipple effect I liked so much. Even so, I thought the character of Gustave could have been established a little more fully. I felt that his vengeful violent act upon Marie-Anne, while not out of character, was a bit unexpected.I will confess that I am more on the side of scientific positivism than of the after life. But this did not affect my enjoyment of Rehak's imagination. I can't imagine he hasn't got something on the go. He is well placed to write a story about life in the present-day Czech Republic. I'm sure there'd be an English-speaking public which would be interested in knowing what is going on there now that the horrors of the 20th century are receding. I do hope he goes on with his writing!",

She has been a favorite writer of Alistair MacLean too.Helen MacInnes specialising in spy/espionage stories, mostly on WW-II sceneario,has written over 20 books, each one being a gem .Her very first book,Above Suspicion(1941) was a bestseller followed by many other best sellers including;Decision at Delphi, Message from Malaga, Venetian Affair, and Salzburg Connection which was also made into a 1972 movie.Helen MacInnes writes most credible stories, and creates most credible,humane characters...no outlandish Ludlum type scenarios, no superhuman characters like James Bond. Reading Helen, one can feel that any one of us can be in similar situation. The Hero's only qualifications are; he is an intelligent and resourceful person with a presence of mind, and has a sense of duty to the country/society. Most of her stories are spy stories in which a common man, accidentally/inadvertently gets caught in a tangle of international espionage and intrigue. Using his own wits and common sense the Hero gets himself out of the situations and in the process thwarts the enemy plans too. The stories have an under current of a subtle romance and love too, which not only embellishes the story but also provides much needed relief to the reader from the tension which readers feel while reading mystery-suspense books.Helen writes beautifully,her description of people,places,and situations is so lucid and picturesque that a reader feels like being in a movie hall watching it all.Double Image is one of her best books. John Craig, an American, economic historian while vacationing in Paris,bumps into his old college professor of Archaeology, Mr.Sussman. Sussman , a survivor of Auschwiz, is in a shock having been accosted by an ex-Nazi official,( who has since been declared as a war criminal )on streets of Paris whereas officially has been declared dead over 10 years ago! Craig teels about the experience to his sister, who blurts it out at a party. Next day Sussman is dead, and Police start questioning Craig, French Intelligence Suerete steps in,...the nightmare starts!.Soon French,Italian,British and American intelligence step in because the man who accosted Sussman is not just an ex-nazi, but much more than that!The scene shifts to Greek Islands, more people get killed, intelligence agents and the enemy agents try outwit each other, intense struggles and interesting chases.The story is very interesting and well written, taut, racy and fast paced. I cant reveal Revealing anything more will take away the pleasure of reading. I want all the readers interested in spy thrillers to read this book. In my opinion, its one of best books of this genre, and highly recommended for a dull weekend.",

I have read most, but not all of his works and I must agree with some of my fellow readers. There is a lot that iswrong with this book. First, Mr. Morrell seems to have broken a cardinal rule of plotting -- he combined two distinct, but unrelated plotlines into one novel and to what purpose? Second, as others have noted, some of the lines between Mitch Coltrane and his erstwhile lady-love border on the absurd and read like the trashy dialogue used on day-time soaps. It made me wonder if Mr. Morrell actually wrote entire sections of the book. In Mr. Morrell's defense, I will say this to his critics. It's very easy for those of us in his reading public to read his works and then &quot;armchair quarterback&quot; what he should and shouldn't have done with his plot and characters. It's another thing entirely to create something (in this case a novel) from nothing. Remember, Mr. Morrell make his living conjuring up stories to entertain the rest of us. That's a big task. How many of his readers could do half as good a job? How many of us could turn out books that please all readers, all of the time? I'm not a published author and I often wonder if any of my fellow critics are, either. Until such time as those of you who are his harshest critics become as big and best-selling an author as David Morrell, I say give him a break. After all, the only perfect person in the history of the world walked the face of the earth 2,000 years ago. He's gone now, David Morrell isn't him and will make a mistake now and then. So will the rest of us. Stop whining and wait for his next work. Or don't! The choice is yours.",

Not so with this new novel.What begins as another of his routine thrillers, with a seemingly superhuman villain killing all that the hero holds dear, ends about half-way through and turns into -- I don't know what. The book jacket describes it as a cross between _Vertigo_ and _Basic Instinct_, but it was just garbage. A supernatural explanation would have been better than what we eventually got by way of resolution. The book reads like an aborted screenplay for a really bad movie. Why Morrell felt the necessity to dovetail these two unrelated plots together is beyond me. It's almost as if he had enough material for two novellas and said &quot;Maybe my readers will buy this, they're stupid!&quot; The book is so disappointing, I think, because it hinted at and promised so much more. Avoid this at all costs!",

In the first, the prime minister of Bosnia is chasing our hero around LA trying to murder him, his family and all his freinds. In the second novel our hero gets mixed up with the most beautiful woman in the world, She is also rich and exudes (would you believe) static electricity. He gives up his girl to go to mexico with the goddess. She turns out to be a diobolical serial killer. After he puts her away his girlfreind (would you believe) returns to him.

                "review/text": "I loved &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; so I was sure I would love &quot;Swift as Desire&quot; just as much. Or almost just as much. And, the opening chapters were quite engrossing and enjoyable. After that, however, the book just seemed to fall apart, or to put it more correctly, it never came together.&quot;Swift as Desire&quot; is Laura Esquivel's autobiographical tribute to her own father and perhaps this is a part of the problem with the book. Perhaps Esquivel just couldn't distance herself enough from her subject matter to manipulate it from &quot;life&quot; into &quot;literature.&quot;&quot;Swift as Desire&quot; is a romance based on Esquivel's father's work as a telegraph operator in Mexico. Apparently, being a telegraph operator was the perfect job for Jubilo since he was born with the gift of knowing just what others wanted to express. In other words, he could &quot;read&quot; the intention behind their words and, he knew which words to choose to best convey those intentions.A character such as Jubilo does give Esquivel the opportunity to insert much comedy into her narrative. For me, one of the best examples comes when Jubilo acts as interpreter between his warring Mayan grandmother and Spanish-speaking mother. Jubilo was careful to soften what these ladies said to each other and the effect is often quite amusing.When Jubilo discovers the telegraph, he knows he has come into his own. The way he saw it, only he would know what people wanted to say to each other so, therefore, he could revise what was being said for maximum impact...and maximum joy, of course. Jubilo, it should be noted, didn't have a malicious bone in his body.Enter Lucha. Lucha is the proud and beautiful daughter of a wealthy Mexican family. Jubilo and Lucha fall deeply in love and soon marry and, even though Mexican women of that era did not, as a general rule, work outside their home, Lucha takes a job as secretary at the telegraph company where Jubilo works. Jubilo and Lucha find that this job rewards them in two ways. First, they can flirt with each other all day long and, at times, even engage in romantic intimacies, and second, the extra income helps Lucha to live with some of the luxuries she had become accustomed to in the home of her parents.If all of this seems idyllic, it isn't. Don Pedro, Jubilo's and Lucha's boss is around to spoil things when he begins to desire Lucha for himself.I have never been a fan of flashbacks, unless they are done extremely well and this is a book told in flashbacks. The narrator is Lluvia (and why should a man as apparently joyful as Jubilo give his daughter such a depressing name?), the daughter of Jubilo and Lucha. By the time Lluvia gets around to telling the story of her parents, Lucha is dead and Jubilo is suffering from both Parkinson's disease and blindness. To ease his sufferings, Lluvia brings him a telegraph, something she hopes will help him communicate with others.The telegraph is one of the book's strong points as well as one of its weakest. When Jubilo is young, the telegraph is a metaphor for desire and the communication of desire, and, as such, it works well. However, in the later section of the book, Esquivel &quot;explains&quot; so much of what she is attempting to do that it really got tiresome. This is a sweet and rather frothy little tale and it needed a much lighter touch than Esquivel seems willing to give it.The characters also suffer in this book. In &quot;Like Water for Chocolate,&quot; I thought every female character was extremely well-developed and unique. In &quot;Swift as Desire,&quot; however, only Jubilo and Lucha are developed and come off as real and believable. Don Pedro is the quintessential villainous caricature and Lluvia is so thinly developed she is almost ghostlike.Esquivel obviously meant this book to be a tribute to a loving (and loved) father. I feel bad for her that it didn't come out better than it did, for it did have potential. Writing students are warned, time and time again, to be very wary of autobiographical material. Perhaps, it is a warning Esquivel should have taken more to heart.&quot;Swift as Desire&quot; isn't a bad way to spend an evening, but it certainly doesn't measure up to &quot;Like Water for Chocolate.&quot; In fact, it doesn't even come close.",

But with this novel, I found little of what I enjoy most about reading Esquivel. This time, my teeth bit into the book hitting nothing but hard cardboard. The story felt like a repetitive draft of a novel she's sent to her publisher to edit or guide. The first chapter leads you to believe you'd be guided by the Mayan calendar and spirit of a people to another perfect love story. But, that theme is quickly forgotten as the story unfolds. I think that Esquivel attempted to create what Isabel Allende did with her book &quot;Paula&quot; (The true story of the relationship Allende had with her beloved daughter who lies comatose throughout the entire book.). &quot;Paula&quot; is heart-wrenching and powerful as we learn about the Allende family history with each chapter of the book. Esquivel tries a similar approach in this story of her dying father, but for me it fell short of the passionate enlightening prose I've become accostumed to with her previous work. The transitions from past to present weren't always clear enough for me. Esquivel's usual magic and passion was completely absent in this story. True Esquivel fans most likely will read it for themselves -- as I did. But if you are just &quot;curious,&quot; I recommend waiting for the paperback.",

But the truth is, I loved this charming,sentimental,sometimes witty, sometimes sad, emotional story. I could not wait to get to it every day. If my phone or doorbell rang, I paused it right where it was, so as not to miss a second of the wonderful reading given by Ellizabeth Pena.I wanted more when it ended and left me with a lump in my throatJubilo, was a special human being. He had a way with words. He worked as an all important telegraph operator, long before E-mail was available. He kept people, loved ones, and businesses abreast of all situations. He seemed to have a magical way of being in tuned with the earth's messages even apart from the telegraph. He was a lover of life. Of the gifts nature provided, and the gifts he was able to give back to his wife, his family and the world.It is his story from boyhood to his dieing day, that Ms. Esquivel delights us with. How this very special man, now blind, made communication an art,hearing things as imperceptible as the movement of a grain of sand,how he loved so deeply, and how he played the hand life dealt him, whether it be great triumphs, or huge losses.Ms Esquivel gives us magical moments with real characters, and a good taste of Mexican and Mayan traditons and heritage.The story of family,the feeling of \"Not knowing what you really have, until it is gone\", will take you by surprise, and linger deliciously. Elizabeth Pena's(\"Lone Star\") reading is not only delightfully enthusiastic, but lends a great deal of authenticity to the read. She manages to find the distinguishable traits in each, to bring them to life. To feel their joys and pain.This edition is an unabridged reading. It has some very descriptive scenes of love making, so it is probably not one you will want to play on your stereo with children about. There are 4 two-sided cassettes, with a total running time of about 6 hours.A tray with a slot for each tape, keeps them in order(may be helpful to vision impaired readers). The sound quality is very good. Sometimes, the reviews for all editions of a book are lumped together, so if it is this audio edition that you are interested in the ISBN is 0375419780. Below the picture of the couple kissing on the cover art, there is a green band that says..Read By Elizabeth Pena - Unabridged.It is a story dedicated to the Author's own father, and after the read, you may feel the need to call your's or at least leave you with thoughts of the special gifts he gave to you.Enjoy....Lauriemore romance audio books:Notorious [Audiobook] by Janet Dailey [Unabridged]The Shipping NewsEchoes (Danielle Steel)",

This book has it all.....a little mysticism, some humor, and love and passion. Read between the lines and you will not be disappointed. It tells about how Jubilo is born, how much his grandmother loves him, a little about the culture of Mayan and Spanish. Jubilo falls in love with Lucha, the daughter of a wealthy mexican family. Lucha loves Jubilo also. Their passion goes on for years.....from when Lucha is 13 till they marry. Lucha is feeling such passion for Jubilo that she decides to marry him so they can fullfil their desire. But married life isn't what she expected. They go through many trials and tribulations. Their passion never seems to die. Jubilo works as a telegraph operator......he changes the messages of his customers to help them communicate what they hope to. Lucha is upset that her life isn't fullfilled enough like when she was a little girl living with her parents and had everything she wanted. They have children and somewhere along the storyline......things aren't communicated and life is not as it seems. And the passion seems to die.......or does it??? The story goes back and forth from the present to the past.......telling how Jubilo's daughter is trying to help him to communicate again since he has Parkinson's and is blind. With the help of his friends and her daughter...they do this. What did I get out of this book? The fact that many times we marry young and don't realize what we are getting into. That many times we make assumptions of what the other spouse is thinking, when it isn't that way at all. That if we just accepted life as it were......would we all have the problems we do today? I read Like Water for Chocolate and this book is not like that.......but written in the same manner that Esquivel writes. She writes in a manner for you to think about what you are reading. And her characters are so funny, loving, and entertaining. I can't wait to read her next book.",

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE GUARDIAN Hakan Veil is an ex-corporate enforcer equipped with military-grade body tech that's made him a human killing machine. His former employers have abandoned him on a turbulent Mars where Earth-based overlords battle for profits and power amid a homegrown independence movement. But he's had enough of the red planet, and all he wants is a ticket back home-which is just what he's offered by the Earth Oversight organization, in exchange for being the bodyguard for an EO investigator. It's a beyond-easy gig for a heavy hitter like Veil . . . until it isn't. When Veil's charge starts looking into the mysterious disappearance of a lottery winner, it stirs up a hornet's nest of intrigue and murder. And the deeper Veil is drawn into the game, the more long-buried secrets claw their way to the Martian surface. Now it's the expert assassin poised against powerful enemies hellbent on taking him down-by any means necessary. Praise for Thin Air \"Kick-ass . . .

There is a Hawk replacement in the person of Chollo, a Latino hit-man from one of Spenser's West Coast connexions and, while not as detailed or intricate as the Hawk conversations, his with Spenser are still pleasurable. The pretext for the action this time is the disappearance of Lisa St. Claire, wife of Spenser's Boston PD friend Frank Belson. When Belson is hit with three shots from behind Spenser activates himself and goes hunting. The trail leads to a Hispanic community in northern Massachusetts ~ hence the introduction of the Latino side-kick. A welcome innovation (from Parker, not for fiction as a whole) is the use of third person sections interspersed, in a different type-face, telling of Lisa's experience.

Child describes the geography, people and culture of Pakistan as well as the logistics of the expedition with such clarity and force that it is not hard to begin imagining you are there with him before too long.But it is his deep respect for all the people he encounters and climbs with that makes this narrative so rich and special. In this regard readers will be moved indeed when Child looses his friend and climbing partner Peter Thexton to pulmonary edema after turning back from the summit on Broad Peak (without getting quite to the top). This tragedy is related with such pathos and power. And it makes Child reconsider the entire enterprise to which he has devoted his life, a process that one rarely reads about in the writings of high altitude mountaineers who so often maintain a stoic attitude reflexively. One's life, Child ultimately decides, takes precedence over the conquest of 8,000 meter peaks; no matter how compelling and significant such a goal may seem.",

                "review/text": "In Thin Air, Robert B Parker deviates from his normal mystery format and produces more of a thriller. What happened and who did it is never in question -- the issue is what will happen. While this is being resolved, Parker reveals rich details about the principal characters, keeping the reader engaged throughout the entire book.Viewpoint varies with the primary chapters, as usual in the Spenser series, from the detectives perspective. Between these, the victim Lisa's view is represented. This is quite nicely pulled off.The welcomed trend in the series of deemphasizing the tiresome participation of Susan in the primary plot continues with Thin Air. Additionally, giving a rest to the use of Hawk as a superhero to completely suppress any opposition is also welcomed. While Hawk is a very enjoyable character, he's overused in the books preceding this.So Thin Air is highly recommended. If there is one criticism, some of the action at the end strains credibility to the point of collapse. But the reader is still touched by the result, something which can't often be said for genre work. This book only reinforces my assessment that Parker is an excellent writer.Dan",

                "review/text": "The story takes place in Boston, Massachusetts. The narrator of the story is Spenser, who was hired to find Lisa St. Claire. Spenser is a private detective who used to work for the FBI. He is hired by Frank Belson to find his missing wife who is Lisa St. Claire. Her ex-husband, Luis Deleon, has kidnapped her. Luis is still madly in love with Lisa. But Lisa is in love with Frank, who is much older than she is. Every one assumes she left him because he is much older than she is and that is why a private detective is hire. During the investigation, Spenser found out a lot of personal things about Lisa St. Claire. She was not the person every one thought she is. Her real name was Angela Richard. She ran away from home ever since she was seventeen with her boy friend, Woody. Woody turns her in to a prostitute. One day she got caught and was sent to rehabilitation. There she decided to get her life back on track. Mean while, Frank was shot at on his front porch from behind leaving him in the hospital for a while. Luis had shot him. Luis was known for being a crazy person. He was the leader of a Hispanic gang. Luis was a hard person to find because no one likes to talk about him. She was kept in a castle like place with cameras all around the room recording her every move. Through out the novel it switches back and forth to the scene where Lisa was at and then back to Spenser.I would recommend the novel because I found it very entertaining. It was like watching a movie. I can picture the whole thing. Spenser was very amusing. He was also tough. He states. \"You'll think I'm offensive? I'll give you offensive. Ms. Lisa St. Claire's husband is a cop. Cops look out for each other. I can, if I have to, have some really short-tempered guys from the Essex County DA's I could probably even get them to come in here in force with the sirens singing and the blue lights flashing, and haul you ass down to Salem and ask you these same questions in a holding cell\" (60). This quote shows what type of person he is. He can be serious but funny at same time. You can tell he is very serious with his work. He was not a boring guy.This is a good novel if you're into mystery because through out the story you keep finding surprising things about Lisa. It made want to keep reading it. \"I don't know could or couldn't. I will say that Angela lived a very harsh life, in very difficult circumstances. She had fewer restraint mechanisms perhaps than some women might have, and she harbored a lot of rage\" (133). Here is when Spenser was meeting up with a woman named Madeline St. Claire. She was a psychiatrist that was seeing Lisa when she was in rehab. She was aware that Lisa was using her name, but did not seem to mind it much. The quote explains how Lisa life was and how she had a rage for men.It was also interesting when Spenser investigate people. It made me seem like I was the investigator. Each interviewer gave helpful facts about Lisa and her whereabouts. There were a lot of people who he had to investigate until he was sure it was Luis who kidnapped her. Each investigation was at a different place. He gave great descriptions when the story takes place. It makes the novel seem so realistic.Overall, I enjoyed reading the novel very much. There were times where I did not want to stop reading because there were things that I wanted to know. This is a great novel for entertainment. It was full of drama and humor. You will like Spenser. It will make reading fun. A great novel to share with a friends or love ones.",

                "review/text": "When &quot;Thin Air&quot; begins with the italicized description of a woman bound in the back of a van, abducted by someone who knows her and is videotaping everything, it is reminiscent of Robert B. Parker's &quot;Crimson Joy,&quot; the first Spenser novel to get away from the first person narrative style of the series. When Detective Frank Belson shows up and tells our hero that his wife is gone, we know the identity of the woman in the van. As far as her husband is concerned, Lisa St. Claire has disappeared into &quot;Thin Air&quot; (Parker has been much more mundane with his titles in his recent efforts and it has been years since he started off with any grandiose literary quotations). Each Spenser novel is unique in its own way and for this one the main trick is that we know what has happened to the damsel in distress and we get to watch as our hero gets closer and closer. Belson does not know anything about his wife before the fateful night they met, and, of course, Spenser uncovers a whole lot of information. But what looks like the old story of the beautiful young wife who leaves her older husband is shattered when Belson is ambushed and almost killed.Whereas the previous Spenser novel dealt with Chinatown, &quot;Thin Air&quot; focuses on the Hispanic elements in the greater Boston area, which forces Spenser to use the assistance of Chollo, the enforcer for the L.A. mobster we met in &quot;Stardust&quot; (Hawk is in Burma--the mind boggles). But while most of the usual supporting cast is not around for this one, Spenser certainly meets a couple of interesting women in the course of his investigation (although I find it strange that Quirk is not a lot more involved in this one). Once again Spenser tries to put all the pieces together and then find a way of making everybody happy, but as usual, things never do work out perfectly. While certainly an atypical Spenser novel, &quot;Thin Air&quot; probably grades out as an average effort for Parker",

Smilla is not always a nice person; most of the time her past envelopes her present and makes her almost unlikeable. The other characters in the novel, the mechanic, her father, the coroner and the blind linguist are so well written that you begin to feel that you know them. I can't agree with the 2/3's assessment,because I find it gripping to the end, even though I have read it many times. The atmosphere of Copenhagen in winter, the language of snow and ice, and the mystery surrounding a young boy's death may not move ahead like an American mystery, but the slow unraveling of the plot is perfect for a novel set in a country where life is lived at a different pace than ours.",

                "review/text": "I probably wouldn't have read this book if it had not been gifted to me at Christmas by my best friend - she had seen the film, and knowing how much I like to read, felt that it would be `right up my alley'...and once again, she was right in her judgment concerning my tastes. One of the quotes on the back cover (from The New Yorker) puts this novel `...in the league of Melville or Conrad' - while I'm not sure I would go quite that far, Heg is a fine writer, and his talents for keeping the reader in suspense as he spins this tale are pretty impressive.The central character, Smilla, is of mixed Greenlandic and Danish parentage - and the conflicts between those two cultures, one colonial, one native, are alive within her constantly. The dialectic that exists between these two forces - which has so often transformed and rent the fabric of human society - tears at her life. She is a strong-willed, intelligent woman who is not really sure what she wants or expects from life - she trusts her instincts, but not necessarily her heart. When she comes upon the body of her six-year-old neighbor Isaiah crumpled in the snow outside their apartment building, dead from a fall from the roof, she is immediately suspicious - and when the police almost instantly rule the death an accident, Smilla's initial doubts increase. They continue to do so almost exponentially as she begins to look into the case - and her investigation leads her into one dangerous situation after another.The author balances the emotional with the sociological and the scientific elements nicely in this story - there are plenty of references to Smilla's inability to trust, and to love (and the reasons that lurk behind), background on the treatment of the Inuit people by the Danes (both in Greenland and in Denmark), and plenty of science as well. The author has done his homework. In the note about the author, it's mentioned that before turning to writing, he worked as a professional dancer, an actor, a sailor, a fencer and a mountaineer - and it's pretty evident that he pursued these activities with attention and zeal. You can see elements from several of them within this work.The writing is intelligent, and flows very nicely - and Heg is masterful in giving away just what he wants to give away as the story progresses. Fans of the literary thriller should give this novel a good, long look.",

Yes, Smilla is a strange woman, but perhaps no stranger than any other human being if they are truly honest with themselves. Smilla questions her own humanity and her capacity to love, but answers those doubts in her actions. It is this very honesty combined with her love of snow that makes this book so intriguing. The passages about her chidhood are quite poignant and you can really feel the little girl inside the disappointed adult remembering her mother and understand the effects of loss and cultural schizophrenia. What is most remarkable is that a man tapped so deeply into the emotions that I suspect many women feel about themselves, their childhood and their attempts at adult relationships. The ending was not so much a disappointment as a deferral, as though someone came into the room, told the writer he had to pack to leave on a UFO and had 5 minutes to write the ending. However, in his defense, I truly did not expect Smilla and the Mechanic to go home, get married and have a few kids. The period spent on the ship is more technical and not quite as emotionally intimate as the earlier chapters, and felt credibility was stretched a bit, but it was still a wonderful story.Interestingly, the temperature outside while reading this book was about 60 degrees.

I can only suggest that Hoeg is an author for whom theme is ever unfolding through his characters, and it is the characters to whom we must look here.The character of Smilla, the heroine of this novel, is developed with such nurturing and painstaking clarity and depth that she is breathtaking. She is so sharply defined that even the remarkable mystery in which we meet her becomes secondary. This book is a work of art of the highest order and it may be read for style alone.But make no mistake, this is a compelling story, which is intellectually demanding of the reader.&quot;Smilla's Sense...&quot; is a story of the strength and determination required by social outsiders in sussing out the underlying motivations of people involved in normative systems of control, and protecting themselves from those systems and the people maintaining them. This novel is about power and survival. Like all of Hoeg's other novels, especially &quot;Borderliners&quot;, &quot;Smilla&quot; takes us on a journey describing characters traveling the real and emotional dialectic of moving away from the social center as they are drawn into a deeper understanding of its aims and of its archetypes. Smilla discovers not just facts, but the mythos underlying them.&quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot; is an ontology of the marginalized psyche interlaced within a remarkable story of the lengths to which a system can be bent towards the individual ambition for power and control.I hate to make comparisons, but a good summer's serious reading list might include this novel with titles such as Morrison's &quot;Song of Solomon&quot;, Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendelum&quot; and DeLillo's &quot;Libra&quot;.",

                "review/text": "I read all the reviews before writing my own because I was curious about the general consensus. People complained about the unsatisfactory ending, what they perceived as the author's intellectual showboating, as well as the narcissistic, cold-hearted selfishness of the main character. I understand the criticism leveled at the ending; I was looking for more resolution in terms of the main character's relationship to her rootless life, but ultimately I accepted that as part of the book, for better or for worse. On the other two counts I couldn't disagree more. What might be taken for pretentiousness is perhaps the author's expertise in many wide-ranging interests. And as for the main character--well, that was what drew me to this book and made it one of my all-time favorites. What I found interesting in the negative reviews was the almost angry vehemence with which readers built their case.I first read this literary thriller when it was published in 1993. Smilla Jaspersen--half Greenlander, half Dane, an unconventional loner and brilliant scientist who struggles with her conflicted upbringing--is devastated when a young boy she has befriended mysteriously falls to his death from the roof of their apartment building. Unsatisfied that it was an accident, she follows a trail from Copenhagen to the bleak Arctic reaches to solve his murder. Since that time I've probably read it a half a dozen times--and not for the incantatory power of the prose. Don't get me wrong--the writing is terrific and the story is compelling, complex, and extraordinarily well-plotted--but what gripped me most about this book was the main character. And she still grips me.Smilla is undoubtedly the first contemporary fictional female character who isn't a wife, mother, saint, or a whore. Imagine a grown-up cross between Nancy Drew and Pippi Longstocking--if they'd been kicked out of every school they ever attended, hitchhiked around the world, maybe did some low-level smuggling, and somewhere along the way managed to pick up a couple of graduate degrees. Smilla is clever, bold, smart, independent, funny, adventurous, slightly reckless, and feels no qualms about telling the men who get in her way to shove off. She's a boat-rocker, whistle-blower, a rule-breaker who thumbs her nose at authority and refuses to submit, like a well-behaved girl, to the ancillary role society would like her to play (e.g., wife, mother, saint, whore). Which, of course, drive the men whose power she challenges into a fury that makes them want to annihilate her. The irony is that she was created by a man.But Smilla's rebellion does not come without intense self-scrutiny and the painful knowledge that she's a lone wolf; at one despairing point in the book she even calls herself a loser. She admits her freakishness, the fact that she cannot find deep connections with others. She usually refrains from getting involved with men because she's terrified of becoming too dependent, of losing herself. She's terrified of being vulnerable, of being loved, of being left. And yet despite all of her fears she plods forward. She laments her inability to make a permanent place for herself in the world, and yet that doesn't deter her from what she feels is her duty--to solve the death of a little boy who may be the one person to whom she had what came close to a true connection. But the greater, unspoken challenge is how to live in the world as a black sheep, particularly if you are a woman.Perhaps the intense dislike some feel towards Smilla stems from her daring to challenge the established structure of society which, despite all the advancements women have made, still places men on top and women underneath. Men dislike her because they can't abide a woman who doesn't know her second place; women dislike her because it forces them to address the power they give away by seeking validation from men. Plus, the world does not show any love for those who tell the truth or root out corruption--they are, more often than not, eliminated in one way or other. And yet, without those who exposed secrets or took the unpopular stand, who took the heat and bucked convention, we'd still be toiling in some medieval gloom.I also loved how Hoeg, in comparing Denmark to Greenland, underscores how the \"progress\" and \"development\" of the modern world have all but destroyed the integrity of ancient cultures, the beauty of the wilderness, and the deeply-ingrained rituals that lend meaning to life as well as binding people together. He weaves examples into the main plot as a kind of elegy to the world as it was before man's maniacal drive to improve it. Some improvements come to mind that did indeed improve the quality of life for mankind--fire, penicillin, and efficient farming methods--but there are so many more that can only make you weep.Now, if only America would produce a heroine as bold, rebellious, and independent as Smilla Jaspersen--and her little sister, Lisbeth Salander.",

I was not disapointed.Although my english is not that good, I fully appreciated this novel. &quot;Affinity&quot; is not an erotic novel. There is love, but not sex, and the fact that the love is between two women is not the main feature. I don't want to make a complete r&eacute;sum&eacute; because I think it is difficult to do so without spoiling the pleasure you'll have reading it until the end.Let's just say that this novel is about a sad young woman who desperately need to be loved, who is desperately ready to believe in love and who thinks that she had find it while visiting a prison in London, in 1874. This is not a funny or a &quot;feeling-good&quot; book. But Sarah Waters knows how to make you feel, smell, taste and see the life of a woman who would have live 125 years ago.Now I know: Sarah Waters is a great author.

Margaret finally decides to free her &quot;future&quot; lover and herself from the solid and imaginary walls that separate them even if it means risking her life.AFFINITY is a powerful yet detailed Victorian tale centering on relationships, especially that forbidden by society between two women. The story line is drawn along two paths, Margaret's current diary and Selina's journal of her pre-incarceration days. Surprisingly, this technique works as readers obtain a juxtaposition glimpse at Selina from her own view and that of her wannabe lover. With homage to the authors of that era, Sarah Waters shows she is a rare talent who demonstrates that emotion and intellect do not often go hand in hand as human frailty intercedes.Harriet Klausner",

I could visualize the dank, thick, stone walls which housed the prisoners.Here's a story of spirits and psychic mediums.Margaret takes on the volunteer work of a Lady Visitor of the women's prison. She is quite obsessed with the place and takes her duties seriously.Margaret meets and is very intrgued by Selena Dawes, a woman in prison for fraud. Margaret has tender feelings in her heart for the unfair, brutal treatment of Selena and the other women imprisoned.This is a very good book telling a very different type of story.The ending of this story is a breath taking surprise!I recommend reading this book, but it is not a light read. It will make you think and it's a terrific book to discuss with others.This is an eye opener of a story.Outstanding writing!",

                "review/text": "Waters successfully brings the Victorian era to life in this story of an emotionally vulnerable &quot;spinster&quot;,Margaret Prior, who attempts to overcome the losses of loved ones by taking up charitable social work with the women of Millbank prison in London. Her relationship with Selina Dawes, a spiritualist imprisoned for fraud and assault, progresses from mere fascination to blind passion, and the reader is pulled along with her in her quest for love and purpose in a world which has deprived her of the opportunity to achieve either. The cold, damp and dreary setting of London and Millbank Prison is a fitting backdrop to this story of Margaret, who much like the women to whom she ministers, is herself imprisoned and nearly destroyed by the repressive social structures of her day. The book is written mostly as excerpts from Margaret's diary. Interspersed among these are brief excerpts from the diary of Selina Dawes, the spiritualist. This technique works brilliantly, because it creates more of a challenge for the reader to distinguish between the inner reality of the characters and the objective reality of the story. It also makes the ending much more dramatic. Read it, by all means. It's a bit of a slow go at first, but the build up is necessary to the progression of the story.",

                "review/text": "This book will disappoint if the reader is expecting a lesbian novel. Though female characters are attracted to other female characters -- after all, the main setting is a women's prison -- there are no moments of lesbian love-making or other conventions of the typical lesbian novel. (To say more is to give too much of the plot away.)But it is a wonderful novel showcasing the incredible skills of its author Sarah Waters. You can read _Affinity_ on so many levels. You can read it for its intriguing plot with its O. Henry conclusion. You can read it as a treatise on 19th century prisons or as a history of Spiritualism in England. If you like 19th c. English novels, you can enjoy _Affinity_ for its faithful emulation of that form. (But remember that the pace will be slow; give yourself 100 pages or so to get into the novel.)Waters' first novel, _Tipping_the_Velvet_, was enjoyed at its deepest level by any reader with some knowledge of the conventions of the picaresque novel and a scat dictionary handy. The same sort of thing is true of _Affinity_. For example, the two books Margaret reads to her mother are not accidental choices. (Think about the theme of Dickens' _Little_Dorrit_). The name of Selina's &quot;spirit control&quot; is too close to the &quot;Peter Quint&quot; of _The_Turn_of_the_Screw_ to be coincidence. Finding the little secrets that Waters sprinkles through her novels are a large part of the joy of reading them.",

It also gives a look into spiritualism, and the conditions of women's prisons.The book moves at a leisurely pace and lulls the reader into thinking not much is really happening, but like a river with a still, dark surface, there are undercurrents beneath.The author is a master of language and writing technique.

This story can be read on several levels, like many readers have discovered. I don't however, consider it to be &quot;lesbian&quot; fiction. It is purely about passion and goes beyond gender, like Selena's spirit friends. The story is quite simple really, Selena Dawes is in prison for fraud and assault. When she was free she used to be a spiritualist and had a control spirit, Peter Quick, who hurt a young girl. Margaret Prior is a visitor to the prison, a lady who talks to the prisoners to make them &quot;better&quot;, to teach them how to be a lady like her. Margaret falls in love with Selena, but a conspiracy is already brewing and Margaret is the perfect pawn for Selena and her key to freedom beyond the dreary prison walls. The story is a mystery, a one-sided romance, a love triangle, a passionate depiction of the Victorian world seen from the prison walls. By the end of the story, the reader gets the feeling, that Selena took Margaret's identity, while Margaret became a prisoner herself. Amazingly written, this story demands attention, respect and complete loyalty. I couldn't stop reading it and I couldn't find flaws with it, I was swept away into a strange world, where the people are caught in strange dealings, but the emotions are the same as yours and mine.

                "review/text": "AFFINITY by Sarah WatersAfter reading Sarah Waters' wonderfully written book FINGERSMITH, I had to get a hold of her other two novels TIPPING THE VELVET and AFFINITY. As with FINGERSMITH, I came away from AFFINITY with a very satisfied feeling of having read yet another great book. AFFINITY is a complex story set in Victorian England about a young woman, Margaret Prior, who has been suffering from bouts of depression and loneliness. She has just suffered from a breakdown shortly after her father's death, and because of a suicide attempt, her mother, with the hopes of making a full recovery keeps her secluded in the house and administered with medications.When it is suggested that Margaret visit the local woman's gaol (prison) as a form of therapy, she agrees and begins her frequent visits. She is known as a \"lady visitor\", one of many that come to the prisons to read and talk to the prisoners as a form of goodwill and charity. Soon she finds herself meeting and conversing with the various women that are being held in this gaol. She meets women from all walks of life and sees the horrible conditions in which they now live. And then she meets Selina Dawes. Margaret takes extra notice of this quiet sad woman. The reader immediately knows that she finds Selina special, and soon she becomes obsessed with the prisoner, and her story. It is all she can think of day and night. It becomes her life.Selina Dawes is a medium, who is able to talk to the dead and perform acts of the paranormal. She is in prison due to the death of a friend of hers, Mrs. Brink, who allowed Selina to live with her as she helped Mrs. Brink contact the netherworld. Mrs. Brink died during one of Selina's paranormal sessions, and is being charged for assault and fraud. Learning about Selina's \"crime\", Margaret is in total sympathy with Selina and knows that Selina is in prison for a crime she did not commit, and soon the two become close.The viewpoints of both women are seen through the journals of each of them respectively. Selina's journal-entries lead to the day of the supposed crime, while Margaret's journal takes us through the present story. And, as the book becomes more and more complicated, the journals begin to reveal more and more secret thoughts of these two women. The ending, as with FINGERSMITH, will totally shock the reader. Sarah Waters is the master of the double-twisted plot device, and although the story started on a slow note, the pace of the book picked up and did not let up until the very last page. Beautifully written with subtle undertones of lesbianism, this reviewer highly recommends AFFINITY.",

                "review/text": "I'm struck by a few similar elements in Affinity and The Turn of the Screw. Sexual repression as it contributed to the female characters' malaise is the clearest.Given Sarah Waters's great scholarship, the choice of Peter Quick's name was surely not coincidental but meant as a nod to Henry James's Peter Quint. Once tipped off, it's a short step to begin doubting the credibility, if not the sanity of the main female character. Why as yet haven't any reviewers commented here on the steady and generous intake of opium (laudanum) and chloral hydrate (a hypnotic) that Miss Prior was accustomed to consuming? While she was most certainly blinded with love for Selina Dawes, her huge drug habit surely further distorted her perceptions and judgment about that lady.Though it could have been shorter and tighter, you can read this story on political, social and psychological levels. What is not ambiguous, however, is the ending. The scam is very real.Common threads running through Sarah Waters's first 3 books (haven't read the most recent yet) are betrayal and the abuse of power, woven into very different and clever entertainments.",

                "review/text": "Accomplished New England author Suzanne Strempek Shea's most recent novel, &quot;Around Again,&quot; presents convicing and evocative evidence that of life's most significant battles, the wars we wage inside ourselves are the most important. The novel features a conflicted protagonist, Robyn Panek, who must return to a family farm which, some twenty years earlier, produced a summer that sundered her attachment to an innocent and hopeful past. Priding herself on her ability to discern that which is real from that which is fake, Robyn must confront not only the unfulfilled status of her present life, but also the traumatizing memories of events which shattered not only friendship and romance, but the very idea of family continuity and personal grace.&quot;Around Again&quot; is a significant departure for the author, whose three previous books possessed an aura of kindness and warmth for the female protagonists whose Polish identity provided nurturing support against life's disappointments. In this talented and provocative novel, Shea depicts a protagonist whose middle-aged existence is one of loneliness, silent anguish, and subdued frustration over past betrayal. Robyn Panek emerges as a fully-rendered character, whose hurt and isolation compel our compassion, whose blasted hopes foster our admiration for her earnest determination to make sense of her past. This is a more somber, sophisticated and adult novel, rich in characterization and deftly presented in a series of cross-cutting chapters which alternate between Robyn as a late adolescent and as a middle-aged woman.Robyn Panek, responding to her uncle's request to close down his beloved family farm in western Massachusetts after he has suffered a near-fatal illness, learns that life does not work out &quot;neat and clean and tidy.&quot; A central metaphor of the novel revolves around the future of a set of ponies, whose backs have carried decades of riders and whose being is central to Robyn's memory of the past and her self-definition today. She must confront the memory of Lucy Dragon, whose suicidal impulses some twenty years ago led to the explosion of all that Robyn held dear. The reflective Robyn comes to realize that &quot;what happens to people between there and here you can never really know.&quot;Suzanne Strempek Shea movingly depicts adolescent friendship through Lucy and Robyn. Reluctantly, slowly, unknowingly, Robyn comes to love Lucy. &quot;The flight and exposition, the self-love and automatic hate...all this shone back at me...So there was no way I could miss or ignore the truth. That looking at this crazy girl, clearly I was also seeing myself.&quot; The relationship between Robyn and Frankie, her first love, brims with unabashed optimism; how Robyn deals with its abrupt transformation perhaps is the single strongest aspect of the novel.This important work, symbolically rich and engrossing in both its narrative and characterizations, signals a new path for its author. Rightfully heralded as a vibrant voice for Polish Americans and a keen interpreter of the mind of young women bordering on self-discovery, Suzanne Strempek Shea now can be perceived as an author whose scope is much, much broader. &quot;Around Again&quot; helps all of us understand what it means to be human.",

Shea skillfully depicts the mix of emotions and memories that inevitably face the one who must pack up after an ailing or deceased relative. &quot;Around Again&quot; gains additional complexity, though, in exploring Robyn's personal history at the farm: the unexpected ending to her last visit, the summer she was 17. It's a shame Ms. Shea is not more widely known or appreciated; she's an extremely talented writer and should not merely be pigeon-holed as the &quot;Polish-American Amy Tan.&quot; &quot;Around Again&quot; does capture dead on the nuances of being a 2nd or 3rd generation Polish-American, but the cultural backdrop is really secondary to a universally-applicable story told with lyrical elegance and deep emotion.",

After all, isn't this how most of us live- partly in the present, and affected by our past? How many of you knew someone in high school who had a dramatic affect on your life?

Twenty-something and savvy, Congressional aid Rachel Mooreshelton's life begins to violently twist and turn following the untimely murder of her office colleague, Persy Pritchard. Life in prominent Congressman Jackson's office will never again be the same. Rookie DC police detective Mike James, pulled in to investigate the Capitol Hill murder of Congressman Jackson's chief of staff, becomes embroiled in a complicated, politically volatile case, that stands to not only blow the lid off of the decades-old bank murder, and topple the old-guard leadership in the Congress, but may also reveal an uneasy truth about one of the nation's most celebrated lawmakers.

They didn't add to character or develop the plot, instead they slowed down otherwise good pacing.This book also has a growing pet peeve that I'm finding in a lot of books, which is referring to characters constantly by the color of their hair, their relative height or age. Once in a while it might help the plot to remind the reader who is older or taller, or to jazz up a visual with a detail about appearance. But more than that I find jarring. It's not dramatic, it's just odd. Give the readers some credit for remembering these details and stick to their names. That's why they have names.",

However, the talented Helen Macpherson makes it work. She pulls the reader gently into the story until suddenly a romance between these two, seemingly different women seems both feasible and fated.Katherine Flynn was left standing alone at the altar... a blessing in disguise because she was marrying out of duty, not for love. Out of shame, she joined a convent and married God instead. Sister Katherine is sent to serve in Australia and dives in headfirst when she first sets foot in this strange place. Her predecessor and many of the townsfolk are killed in a storm the day Katherine arrives. The priest she will be working with is out of town, so she reluctantly gives last rites to the deceased. It seems even her lodging has been destroyed by the storm so she accepts the hospitality of rancher Catriona Pelham.Catriona Pelham, although wealthy in her own right, is looked down upon by the town's religious elite. It seems Catriona doesn't conform to their ideas regarding female behavior. The rancher wears pants, plows fields, and basically works with the men in the community. To make matters even worse, her brother was engaged to the local nun (Katherine's predecessor) and their parents are dead.Macpherson does a wonderful job illustrating Katherine's struggle between her commitment to the church and her growing feelings for Catriona. The author brings in many supporting characters that help Katherine work through this complex situation. There are Susan and her lover who show Katherine that love between women is not wrong. There is the female leader of the bushrangers who stirs physical sensations the nun has never experienced. And, finally, there is Catriona's first (yet former) lover who shows up unexpectedly and invokes Katherine's jealous streak.I loved the author's first book - Colder than Ice - and am certainly not disappointed with this one. There are a few minor plot elements that weren't really necessary, but overall I'd recommend `Trespass' for a great read set in late 19th Century Australia.",

Up until the end you are not sure what the resolve will be.The secondary characters are so intriguing that I would enjoy reading a sequel to this story involving both Susan and Me-Lin as most especially Adele.From the publisher's website - Sister Katherine Flynn is an Irish nun, sent by her order to work in the remote Australian countryside of New South Wales. Katherine is a prideful woman who originally joined her order to escape the shame of being left at the altar. She had found herself getting married only because society dictated it for a young woman her age, and she was not exactly heartbroken when it didn?t take place. Yet, her mother could not be consoled and talked of nothing except the disgrace that she had brought to the Flynn name. So, she finds great relief in escaping the cold Victorian Ireland of 1872.Catriona Pelham is a member of the reasonably affluent farming gentry within the district. Her relationship with the hardworking townspeople and its farmers is one of genuine and mutual respect. The town?s wealthy, however, have ostracized her due to her unorthodox ways and refusal to conform to society?s expectations of a woman of the 1870?s. Catriona finds comfort in the friendship of the townspeople and farmers, but at night she pines for the lover she lost long ago?her governess, Adele Cooper.As a bond between Katherine and Catriona develops and so the journey begins for these two strong-willed women. For Katherine it is a journey of self-discovery and of what life holds outside the cloistered walls of the convent. For Catriona it is bittersweet, as feelings she has kept hidden for years resurface in her growing interest in Katherine.",

A sweeping novel, unflinching and evocative in its engrossing study of love, motherhood, sex, Mexico, journalism and more.\" - WASHINGTON POST \"Masterful . . . Elegance, darkness, even fear are deftly intertwined . . . A wonderful read.\" - LUIS ALBERTO URREA, Pulitzer Prize finalist and bestselling author of The House of Broken Angels Recommended by Los Angeles Times -> Washington Post -> Parade -> Good Housekeeping -> NBC News -> Today.com -> Goodreads -> Audible -> The Millions -> Popsugar -> Tribeza -> CrimeReads -> Library Reads -> She Reads -> and more! An evocative drama about a woman caught leading a double life after one husband murders the other, and the true-crime writer who becomes obsessed with telling her story-this masterful work of literary suspense marks the debut of an extraordinary new writer The dance becomes an affair, which becomes a marriage, which becomes a murder... In 1985, Lore Rivera marries Andres Russo in Mexico City, even though she is already married to Fabian Rivera in Laredo, Texas, and they share twin sons. Through her career as an international banker, Lore splits her time between two countries and two families-until the truth is revealed and one husband is arrested for murdering the other. In 2017, while trawling the internet for the latest, most sensational news reports, struggling true-crime writer Cassie Bowman encounters an article detailing that tragic final act. Cassie is immediately enticed by what is not explored: Why would a woman-a mother-risk everything for a secret double marriage? Cassie sees an opportunity-she'll track Lore down and capture the full picture, the choices, the deceptions that led to disaster. But the more time she spends with Lore, the more Cassie questions the facts surrounding the murder itself. Soon, her determination to uncover the truth could threaten to derail Lore's now quiet life-and expose the many secrets both women are hiding. Told through alternating timelines, More Than You'll Ever Know is both a gripping mystery and a wrenching family drama. Presenting a window into the hearts of two very different women, it explores the many conflicting demands of marriage and motherhood, and the impossibility of ever truly knowing someone-especially those we love. \"A seductive, urgent tale about desire, family, the pursuit of truth, and the art of storytelling, More Than You'll Ever Know will astonish readers with its vastness, romance, tragedy, and abundant heart. I didn't want this book to ever end.\" - JESSAMINE CHAN, New York Times bestselling author of The School for Good Mothers \"A gripping and thoughtful exploration of motherhood and marriage, the complexity of female desire, and the consequence of our obsession with true crime . . .

Paralleling two tragic stories, Ms.Guthecon allows her readers to glimpse life in small town Maine almost 100 years apart with an equally paralleling story. The reader not only comes to know the characters well but also the landscape of the island and town. The story, while sad, has wondrous moments of first love and devotion.

Hannah, elderly now, tells us about a summer long ago when she was just a girl and fell in love with Conary Crocker. It was the summer her stepmother rented the old schoolhouse in Dundee, Maine, the schoolhouse which had been on the island where a murder had taken place 50 years before. Artfully woven into a tapestry of intrigue, the stories become one as the tales unfold. Although I am a constant reader, I seldom stay up past my bedtime to read, but this book was the exception. Ms. Gutcheon has not only changed her style from previous novels, she has proven herself to be a master story teller.

Set in the context of a treasure hunt through, of all places, the Polynesian Islands, it tells the story of a developing relationship between Claire Bancroft, daughter of an eccentric British naturalist, and Rand Hamilton, the last surviving son of a Charleston family devastated by the Civil War. Claire and Rand are thrown together by a two-part riddle that ultimately requires both their combined knowledge and skills in order to solve. The book stands out not only because of the unique premise, but also especially because of the characters, which are very well developed, with depth and believability. Their conversations are wonderful, and it feels like one is actually watching two real people fall in love slowly and deeply. Ms. Goodman manages to infuse the story with tenderness, sensuality, and humor all at once! The growing romance between Rand and Claire is also told in a manner that is refreshingly free of pettiness and artificial fights, because Claire has a condition which forces her to deal with the world without the usual coquettishness, and Rand won't let her feel sorry for herself. Instead, Ms. Goodman's writing manages to convey, in Rand's character, deep devotion without too much machismo or posturing.The mystery is kept secret till near the end. The setting is unusual and somewhat exotic. I know I will want to read this book again, to catch all the nuances I missed the first time. I recommend it highly.If you do get this book, read chapter 10 slowly and carefully. Hidden within it, in an almost off-hand interchange between Rand and Claire, is a powerfully beautiful and intense declaration of love that doesn't come along very often.",

I assume the ghost is Claris (though this is never made clear) but can't see why she wants to harm Hannah &amp; Conary. The author implies that the ghost &quot;wants&quot; something but never tells us what. The ending is especially unsatisfying. What happens after Conary dies - does the ghost continue to haunt Hannah or is it satisfied and if so, in what way? I thought the character development was extremely weak and the story full of cliches. The description of the ghost as a dark specter with burning eyes made me groan it's so overdone. The landscapes fared better and I could visualize the places in the novel. I kept reading how &quot;chilling&quot; and scary this book was but I found it to be neither and the &quot;romantic&quot; scenes (the fair, clamming on the island) were boring. Maybe I missed something, but like Hannah I just can't figure out what the ghost wants and how it relates to Hannah &amp; Conary.

It was not of the typical romance genre, it actually makes the reader feel intelligent. Rand and Claire pulled my heart, I was filled with angst and hope for them. Ms. Goodman's plots are intriguing and unique, none of the usual shenanigans seen in lesser romances. The character Rand is strong but soft enough to express what he loves about Claire and has the ability to grieve. Claire on the otherhand is not afraid to show that she is vulnerable and witty. There is a little shocker that is disclosed early on in the novel but I don't want to give too much of the story away. But you must trust me that this is a keeper. I have been a fan of Ms. Goodman's for over 10 years. Her earlier works, especially Passion's Sweet Revenge and Wild Sweet Ecstacy are to die for, if you can get a hold of a copy it will well be worth your time and money. I can't wait for the next enstallment, I personally felt that the last couple of novels prior to this one have not been Ms. Goodman's best but it seems her beautiful touch is back.",

Tory, the heroine, is quite engaging, not a simpering southern belle, but a deep individual coming to terms with her past as well as looking towards her future. Cade, as the understanding hero of the book, is not just a spoiled rich boy, but a man who tries his best to be a fair person in a climate where right isn't always the most popular course to follow. With supporting characters that are just as interesting as the leads, this book is a can't-put-down kind of story, with nail-biting intensity. It's Nora Roberts at her best!",

Nora Roberts sometimes gets accused (sometimes justly so) of making her heroines weak and dependent, but Tory doesn't fit that mold no matter how much she herself feels she may fall apart. Which doesn't mean she doesn't come to need and depend on Cade, the wonderful brother of her childhood friend who comes back into her life. It just means that, having taking control of her life and become her own master, she's finally ready to share that life with someone who's not looking to control it. The relationship between these two was very realistic, very sweet, and a necessary part of Tory's healing process from her abusive childhood. As a murder mystery, there were few real &quot;clues&quot; as to who the killer was, but I did guess halfway through. This didn't diminish my enjoyment, it just made me want to see if I was right. I also noticed the screw-up other readers have mentioned that the author made in terms of the timing of the murders -- I wondered if in editing all the dates got mistaken by 10 years or so. After puzzling over the inconsistencies and then reading the reviews on this website where other people noticed the same thing, I let it go and didn't let it hinder my enjoyment of the book at all. It'll get fixed in the next printing. Lastly, I agree the ending was fairly abrupt. The book definitely could have used an epilogue or something so that the reader would get some payoff and see Tory and Cade happy, Faith restored (pardon the pun), and Progress healed. All in all, an excellent, page-turning story.",

The story was great, I loved the characters, and the setting was a nice change from England or Scotland. Although it was a well written book, towards the end, I was starting to get a little bored. But, this taste of Kathleen E. Woodiwiss is enough to have me looking for more. I started reading her books with _The Flame and the Flower_, and I will definitely be snatching up her books in the future.Shemaine O'Hearn had the perfect life. She was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, she came from a loving family, she was beautiful, and she was betrothed to the heartthrob of England. This all changed when the whim of an overjealous grandmother had her captured by a theive taker and carried to America on a convict boat. Shemaine knows that her life will never be the same, and all she can hope for is that a kind soul will take some pitty on her and that she will be sold into indentured servatude to a nice family or person.In the town of Newport Newes lives Gage Thorton, a man haunted by his past. A year ago, his wife died, leaving him with a son to take care of. And, even though Gage loved his wife dearly, there is supiscion in the town that he killed his lovely wife. So, when the convict ship, the London Pride, docks in the town's port, he is desperate for a nursemaid for his son, and maybe some company. As soon as he sees Shemaine, he knows that he must have her, no matter the cost. She can educate his son and provide him with some company.Shemaine is at first wary of her knew job, but soon settles into it nicely. Andrew, Gage's two year old son, is a complete doll, and Gage is the kindest, most handsome man she has ever met. The two get along famously, and a love blossoms between them. But, awful gossip and lies threaten to rip the two apart. Can they survive?Kathleen E. Woodiwiss is really a great author. Some people complain about her purple prose, but I think it makes her books fun to read, and it is easier to imagine the historical setting that way. Her use of adjectives really brought the book to life, and you have no trouble picturing the drama in you head. Gage and Shemaine were the type of heros and heroines that I love reading about. Yes, they were perfect, so what? The whole point of romance novels is to get lost in them and to wish that someday you could be like that too. It is nice to read about people who don't have to lather on makeup to look decent. Shemaine was the woman we would all like to be. She's kind, loving, and she has a spine. When she sees something that is not right, nothing can stop her from fixing it. Gage is the man we all want. He's handsome, understanding, and doesn't let his pride get in the way of telling the woman he loves how he feels. So, all in all, _Petals on the River_ is a book that you should take the time to read. Although it does get slow at times, you will be happy you read it after you finish it. I know I am.",

Shemaine O'Hearn has been falsely accused of thief, put in prison, and sent by ship to the colonies to remove her from her prestigious fiance's life (inwhich his family didn't think she was good enough). She is sold as an indentured servant to the highest bidder - Gage Thornton, widow and local ship builder who needs a nanny for his toddler son. Rumors have it that Gage killed his wife by pushing her off his ship during a fit of rage due to an angry temper. But Shemaine can't imagine such after seeing him handle his son with love and her with respect and kindness. Desires begin to grow between Shemaine and Gage but they work at dealing with them honorably while a few in the community try to stir rumors up about their living conditions and her past. There is one in particularly that just knew Gage would turn to her to replace his deceased wife. Jealously strikes out between her and Shemaine. Then Shemaine's family show up from Scotland in search for her, along with her English fiance - but it is too late. Shemaine and Gage couldn't ignore feelings any longer and got married. Tempers flair and - by the way - just how did Gage's first wife really die? It was true Woodiwiss style of writing with romance and suspence (that, yes, you could probably guess at but was still good). I enjoyed it and felt the love between Shemaine and Gage.

        "description": "To look at one was to see the other. For family, even the girls' own father, it was a constant guessing game. For strangers, the surprise was overwhelming. And for the twins Olivia and Victoria Henderson, two remarkable young women coming of age at the turn of the century, their bond was mysterious, marvelous, and often playful--a secret realm only they inhabited. Olivia and Victoria were the beloved daughters of a man who never fully recovered from his wife's death bearing them in 1893. Shy, serious Olivia, born eleven minutes before her sister, had taken over the role of mother in their lush New York estate, managing not only a household but her rebellious twin's flights of fancy. Free-spirited Victoria wanted to change the world. She embraced the women's suffrage movement and dreamed of sailing to war-torn Europe. Then, in the girls' twenty-first year, as the first world war escalated overseas, a fateful choice changed their lives forever. It began when Victoria's life was about to become a public scandal. It led to a painful decision, and brought handsome lawyer Charles Dawson into the Henderson's life and family. Hand-picked by the twins' father to save his daughter's reputation, Charles was still mourning his wife's death aboard the Titanic, struggling to raise his nine year-old son alone, determined never to lose his heart again. Charles wanted to believe that, for the sake of his son, he could make an unwanted marriage work. But in an act of deception that only Olivia and Victoria could manage, the twins took an irrevocable step, which changed both their lives forever; and took one of the twins to the battlefields of France, the other into a marriage she longed for but could not have. From Manhattan society to the trenches of war-ravaged France, Mirror Image moves elegantly and dramatically through a rich and troubled era. With startling insight, Danielle Steel explores women's choices: between home and adventure, between the love for family and the passion for a cause, between sacrifice and desire. But at the heart of Mirror Image is a fascinating, realistic portrait of identical twins, two vastly different sisters who lead their lives and follow their destinies against a vivid backdrop of a world at war.",

This book starts out only one year after the Titanic tragically sinks. We meet Olivia and Victoria Henderson, two strikenly beautiful mirror image twins. One could not tell one from the other. Olivia is the calm and surreen one where as Victoria is the wild feminist. After a visit to New York, Victoria disgraces her good name. Her father becomes so horribly enraged and forces her to marry a man she didn't love. A man meant for her sister Olivia. His wife had died on the Titanis and he was left taking care of his little boy. This book will take you to New York all the way to war ravaged France. You will laugh and cry and look at life in a whole new beautiful day. This novel will make you love yourself and love the simple blessings you are granted. Don't let yourself pass this book up. Embrace it and love it like a beautiful child. Let the words speak to your heart and soul. And along the way LEARN! You will love this book.",

The \"evil\" one is a selfish, spoiled brat with an empathetic scale of a psychopath, while the \"good\" one is vicariously living through her sister's escapades and cleaning up her messes because she is too boring and dull to create an interesting life for herself. Meanwhile, a prudish lawyer walks into their lives and falls in love with the boring one while desiring the selfish one and confuses his feelings for the two so often he marries the wrong one who loathes him in bed and out-ridiculous! Predictably the good sister says and does nothing, like the martyr that she supposedly is and yet she has no problem switching places with her sister(when the evil sister runs away and forces the good one to take her place) and sleeping with her sister's husband-too incestuous for my taste!In short, skip this novel it was truly ridiculous. I would recommend Zoya, The Ring, Remembrance, Palomino, To Love again, and many others of her early work.",

Each time I have admitted that her books are enjoyable to me as they offer a nice diversion from the many serious, well-written novels by other novelists. I think of Danielle Steel as a novelist I like to read in-between tackling more challenging ones - like when one wants to watch a TV movie. In &quot;Mirror Image&quot; I have to admit I was pleased with the ending for it wasn't wrapped up in a nicely neat fairy-tale ending. I hope Ms. Steel continues to write more realistic conclusions. However, much of &quot;Mirror Image&quot; was disappointing. The story of Olivia and Victoria, two identical, mirror image twins, with two very different personalities takes a long time to progress. Victoria scandalizes the family by having an affair with a married man and her father, in order to rectify the family name, forces her to marry a man she does not love, but whom her twin sister loves. Much of what follows is predictable and it is not until Victoria goes to Europe to help with the war that &quot;Mirror Image&quot; becomes interesting. Ms. Steel is not a great writer; therefore, it is her story-telling capabilities which sets her apart from other romance writers and which always keeps this reader enthralled. Unfortunately, &quot;Mirror Image&quot; did not move - it just coasts along. Not one of Ms. Steel's best efforts but, as I said before, I hope she continues writing endings like this one.",

Olivia and Victoria are completely identical, so much so that no one can tell them apart, not even Victoria's husband, Charles. When Victoria decides she wants to head off to Europe to serve as a volunteer for the war effort, Olivia takes her place as Charles' wife. I haven't read Danielle Steel since Star, mostly because she seems to have lost her ability to capture her readers. The first 20 pages of Mirror Image is a hodge-podge of explanations and repetitive paragraphs. How many pages does it take to know that these glorious, beautiful twins are identical? In addition, I felt nothing for the characters. Victoria was too selfish, Olivia was too passive and Charles, what little we had to go on other than he lost his wife on the Titanic, was too dull. Danielle needs to take another look to alleviate the glaring inconsistencies this book dishes out, not to mention incorrect grammer usage. Please, no Sunday night movie of this one.",

Unfortunately, my brother gave me this book for Christmas (he knows that I like to read, but he doesn't understand that I have standards) -- and, like the dummy I am, I actually wasted time reading it. The storyline was unbelievably predictable, and the characters were one-dimensional and shallow. Not only that, but the author is either not very subtle or assumes that her readers are idiots. How many times must she refer to the twins switching places and loving each other to death in order for us to understand what makes them tick? Please, Danieele Steel, stay away from historical novels and PLEASE stay away from the subject of identical twins. Or else, write something that is interesting and original. And readers, if you want to read something that is romantic and historical as well as intelligent and interesting, go for Sir Walter Scott's &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; or, if your not into classics, at the very least, Johanna Lindsey. My overall message: don't insult your intelligence by reading &quot;Mirror Image.&quot;",

A thought provoking, heart-warming and heart-aching book, &quot;Mirror Image&quot; will teach you the power of love siblings can have for one another and the power of Love in general. If you have brothers or sisters... you can relate. If you have none... you'll learn the power... the eternal power... of the love siblings can share for one another as well as learn the healing power of Love.

The fact that Victoria had an affair with a married player causes her father to engage her to Charles. However, Olivia is obviously the one suited to him. She's the one who finds him respectful and whom adores his child. The new engagement is convenience only on both parts of the party. There is no love. Victoria marries to cover the scandal of the affair and Charles needs a mother for his child. Victoria eventually convinces Olivia to switch. She wants to go to the battlefields. Victoria sinks in a ship but later is discovered that she is actually alive. From that point on, both the twins find love. And voila, you got the plot.And yet, it was just so poorly written at times!(the first half anyway). There were many times where Danielle Steel kept talking about 1)how identical they looked 2)how beautiful they were 3)how Charles felt Victoria was more wild and fiesty. 4)how ppl kept staring at their remarkable beauty. It just started getting corny after a while and I found myself rolling my eyes at times. I get the point after the first 5 times...I love Danielle Steel's books but this one isn't as good as some of her others. For another book with almost identical plot, I suggest reading 'Deceptions' by Judith Michael.",

When they were children they would &quot;switch identities&quot; to do things the other twin didn't want to or couldn't do. They try to pull this off in adulthood after Victoria has an affair with a married man and then is forced to marry her father's lawyer. To add some spice to the story Victoria's sister Olivia is very much attracted to Charles, the lawyer, and his young son Geoff. Geoff was on the Titanic with his mother when it sunk. She died and so now Charles is raising Geoff on his own. This is why he agrees to marry Victoria. The &quot;switch&quot; occurs after Victoria decides she cannot be married anymore and wants to go to Europe to help with the War.This story seems to be about a good twin and a bad twin. As sweet as Olivia is Victoria is just as bad. The story was OK but it seemed to take forever to set up everything. The switch doesn't take place until halfway through the book. After that things seem to move more quickly and the story becomes more entertaining. The characters are typical of those found in Danielle Steel novels. The whole &quot;switching&quot; storyline did seem to be a little far-fetched to me. How could a husband not know that someone else was pretending to be his wife?? In fact, no one seemed to notice that Olivia was standing in as Victoria. I just don't see how this could happen in real life.This was an OK read to pass the time. I have read much better Danielle Steel books. I would recommend Malice, No Greater Love, The Ring, or Lightning instead of this book.",

Olivia takes over her life back in the States. The plot then goes through ups and downs. But, through it all, the sisters keep their unbreakable bond.

Since the story is so intricate and full of detail, I would strongly advise not to read this book by its own since the reader might become confused and would not truly appreciate this magnificent tale. Although, unfortunately, the story is not available in one volume, all four books are certainly worth the money they cost. Moreover, each volume has a beautiful cover depicting scenes from the novel.The story takes place in medieval Norway, a land torn by unremitting warfare and not yet fully converted to Christianity. The first three books tell the story of Olav Audunsson, who, after killing a man at a very young age, becomes an outlaw. As a consequence, he has to endure a long and bitter separation from Ingunn Steinfinnsdatter, his childhood sweetheart, before they are finally able to marry. However, their new life is tainted by Olav's past and by the fact that Ingunn has brought shame upon herself. Although Olav once again becomes a man of wealth and stature, he is haunted by his past deeds and cannot find true happiness. Having lost his wife and being estranged from his son, Olaf leaves Hestviken and embarks on a journey of adventure and remorse which will finally lead him to a bloody reckoning.In this concluding volume, Olav is no longer a young man. He has outlived his enemies and the woman he once loved so deeply. Now, in his twilight years and foreseeing the fearful consequences of their action, Olav is forced to watch his children, and especially his rebellious oldest son Eirik, reenact the sins for which he himself suffered so greatly as a youth.The author's prose is so incredibly beautiful and the story is so rich in historical detail that it reminds one of the great Norwegian Sagas. It takes the reader back to a time when violence and bloody vendettas racked a land not yet fully touched by Christianity. The author depicts strong characters driven by passion and a desire for revenge who seldom find true peace and happiness. Written between 1925 and 1927 by a woman, this novel was truly ahead of its time.",

One of my very favorite scenes, when Eirik says his vows before entering the monastery, was deeply moving to me.

Unable to mentally remain or perhaps refusing to stay in the present, Isobel reflects back to the pivotal point in her life, the summer of '36. She relates the drama of that year to her only surviving son who patiently awaits his mother's death.That summer in Cypress, Minnesota, with her two sons away with their father on his island folly, Isobel and her daughter meets Chicago heiress Cathryn Malley. Cathryn's husband is also away on engineering business. On the bright side, Cathryn provides meaning and identity to Isobel's life beyond that of mother and wife by introducing her to the fine arts. On the other hand, Cathryn begins an affair with Jack Reese in which Isobel plays a reluctant, guilt-ridden middleman. Isobel hides what she knows from Cathryn's spouse who suspects his wife is cheating. Then one day, the lovers vanish as Jack's cabin burns to the ground haunting Isobel till her dying day.THE GRANITE ISLANDS is a fabulous romantic relationship drama that seems like a well-written throw back to a time when romanticism meant something different. The story line starts a bit choppy, but once the flashbacks to 1936 get into gear, the plot is smooth sailing and worth the time. Fans of powerful emotional women's mainstream fiction with a historical bent will fully enjoy a strong character-based romantic tale that will make debut author Sarah Stonich a household name rather quickly.Harrriet Klausner",

A poem buried in Isobel's subconcious (TS Eliot's &quot;Marina&quot;)is slowly revealed to the reader, and to Isobel herself. The inclusion of this elegant poem parallels events in Isobel's life, defines them, and pays homage to the poet, reminding us that writers are by nature readers, living amongst a great wealth of words. The novel is a character study wrapped in a mystery and a heart-wrenching series of personal tragedies. This first novel by a talented new writer will surely succeed, assuring Ms. Stonich's place in contemporary fiction. This author's careful and precise use of language reminds me of earlier writers of similar tales; Virginia Wolff, Katherine Mansfield, and Edna Ferber (to whom the author respectfully nods, mentioning a similar story of fate versus free will). While this book will doubtless become a film, I say grab it read it well before that eventuality, for the emotional depth of this story cannot be portrayed on a screen in a few brief hours. If a few minor bits of the plot of These Granite Islands seem laid on rather thickly, the character development and very real dialoge redeem Stonich's lovely, memorable story.

You, the reader, is right there with Isobel as she remembers her past as she lies there on her deathbed.

What Thomas, her youngest son, didn't know is that Isobel knew the couple in question.

                "review/text": "Water serves as a powerful metaphor for isolation, death and conquering personal fears. The searing heat of summer, the frozen fingers of Fate in winter, all form the images of a story lived against Nature's immutable canvas. At the end of a long, often lonely life, Isobel Howard replays each chapter behind failing sensibilities, as her last living child, Thomas, holds his own vigil at her bedside.The most defining attachments in Isobel's lifetime are her marriage to Victor Howard and a summer friendship in 1936 with Cathryn Malley, who has come to the mining town in Minnesota with her husband, who travels often on business. That this short acquaintance so impresses Isobel's remaining years, says much about the repression of the times, as Isobel vicariously experiences Cathryn's infidelity, drawn to the adventure and unpredictability of Cathryn's inclinations. In reality, Cathryn suffers from a yet undiagnosed mental illness, and remains untreated, as do many whose errant behavior is labeled wildly inappropriate at that time.Cathryn tumbles into Isobel's world as a funny, generous, helpful surprise while the more stolid Isobel struggles to fill the summer with an enterprise of her own, as Victor and her two young sons camp on a nearby island he purchased for his family's enjoyment. Isobel remains at home with her young daughter, hurt that Victor has failed to comprehend her innate dread of water, although she's never mentioned this fear to him.When Cathryn becomes emeshed in an affair with Jack, an island man, Isobel is both attracted and repulsed by their unbridled passion, and shamefully implicit; Isobel inevitably conquers her own fear of water, paddling daily in a canoe as she serves as sentry, prepared to alert the lovers should Liam return unexpectedly. Aware that this affair can only end in tragedy, Isobel remains a passive onlooker, unable to precipitate any action, a choice that will haunt her conscience forever. At the end of that fateful summer, Cathryn, Jack and Liam are shrouded in the mystery of disappearance and death, the town humming with supposition and suspicion. Victor returns to comfort his wife, and Isobel carries her questions to the grave without resolution save her own imagination.It is unclear at what age Isobel is widowed. Since her marriage and children are the foundation of her contentment and the fulfillment of her early years, I found it incongruous that the death of her son Henry was given so little attention, while the passion of a short-time friend consumed so much energy throughout the many years ahead. From the beginning it is clear that Isobel is at the final destination of her long life, tying the loose threads together in her mind; Stonich handles these particular moments with a subtle awareness. While the story line is somewhat frayed, Stonich has written some beautifully descriptive passages, intuiting a softening of memory and the need for a last peaceful compromise with the immanence of death.",

        "description": "The Tea Rose is a towering old-fashioned story, imbued with a modern sensibility, of a family's destruction, of murder and revenge, of love lost and won again, and of one determined woman's quest to survive and triumph. East London, 1888-a city apart. A place of shadow and light where thieves, whores, and dreamers mingle, where children play in the cobbled streets by day and a killer stalks at night, where bright hopes meet the darkest truths. Here, by the whispering waters of the Thames, a bright and defiant young woman dares to dream of a life beyond tumbledown wharves, gaslit alleys, and the grim and crumbling dwellings of the poor. Fiona Finnegan, a worker in a tea factory, hopes to own a shop one day, together with her lifelong love, Joe Bristow, a costermonger's son. With nothing but their faith in each other to spur them on, Fiona and Joe struggle, save, and sacrifice to achieve their dreams. But Fiona's dreams are shattered when the actions of a dark and brutal man take from her nearly everything-and everyone-she holds dear. Fearing her own death at the dark man's hands, she is forced to flee London for New York. There, her indomitable spirit-and the ghosts of her past-propel her rise from a modest west side shopfront to the top of Manhattan's tea trade. Authentic and moving, Jennifer Donnelly's The Tea Rose is an unforgettable novel.",

                "review/text": "Wow! Finishing this book was the one thing I dreaded. The Tea Rose was a captivating, heartfelt, and engaging read. I was lost in this fascinating, atmospheric world of 19th century London, and would love to go back sometime and revisit the wonderful characters that Jennifer Donnelly created.The Tea Rose tells the story of 17-year-old Fiona Finnegan and her beau, Joe Bristow. Fiona, a worker in a tea factory, and Joe, a coster in his family's produce business, have big dreams of opening their own tea shop one day. Saving money from every paycheck into an old cocoa tin, Fiona and Joe slowly get closer to realizing their dream. But things don't always work out they way they're planned -- the unionization of labor workers, a serial murderer on the loose, and a scheming buxom blonde play their part in destroying everything Fiona and Joe has worked for.There is so much more to this novel, however, but I don't want to ruin the fun for readers to discover for themselves. There are many supporting characters that add complexity and texture to this story, and Jennifer Donnelly has done an exceptional job of bringing them all to life. The writing is concise and the perfect balance of dialogue and description. I loved every page, especially since there was always something new and exciting happening. The best book I've read so far this year, and most likely one that will be hard to top.",

                "review/text": "After a promising beginning, author Jennifer Donnelly slowly moves this saga into the land of soap opera. The first portion, introducing characters and setting, are very well done. The hard-scrabble lives of the underprivileged in London in the 1880's come alive. I didn't even mind the Jack the Ripper plot, until the author stretches believability by bringing that subplot into the limelight. Part Two of the book begins a section that should be labeled \"Part Too\" because everything is too overdone. Fiona is too lucky, too ambitious, too beautiful. There are too many coincidences. Part Three is also too much. Fiona invents iced tea. Her sexless marriage is a \"pure\" love. Fiona invents tea bags. Really. Then the author descends into quintessential soap opera land, pitting Fiona against pure evil. The denouement of the love story between Joe and Fiona is overshadowed by the extreme melodrama. Donnelly has a pleasant writing style that cannot overcome the predictable. She allows action to overtake characterization. When all 544 pages were finished, I was left feeling like the time invested had paid no dividends.",

                "review/text": "I would give this book 10 stars if I could. In lieu of that, I'm recommending it to everyone I know as the \"must read\" book of the year. Not only does this have as romantic a love story as you could ever want, but it also features an epic sweep of Victorian London and late 19th century New York, a diabolical killer, and an all-consuming plot for revenge. At the center of all of this is Fiona Finnegan, an endearing heroine who lifts herself from the slums of London to become the queen of tea merchants residing in an upscale 5th Avenue mansion.The story telling is so intimate and compelling that I did not want to ever put this one down. Fiona captures your heart when you first meet her clutching twelve pounds, two shillings, and a dream in a battered cocoa tin. When she finds her perfect love affair shattered by another woman's wanton seduction and a vicious murder decimates her family, Fiona's staunch character is tested to its limits. A barrage of even more tragic events leads her to a heart-stopping escape to New York and more problems to overcome. In addition to Fiona, the secondary characters are so well drawn that you feel connected to them immediately. Her loving father Paddy, her mam, brothers Charlie and Seamie as well as Uncle Michael, her dear friend Nicholas, and many others will capture your imagination. But it is Fiona's love for the unforgettable Joe Bristow and her steadfast goal of destroying her father's killer that will keep you glued to the pages and relishing every delicious moment of this story.",

More specifically, I found the storyline concerning the romance between the protagonist and her 'significant other' just too familiar, paralleling plots that can easily be found in any soap opera. What ends up happening to Fiona and Joe (the main characters) was just way too predictable for my liking. Trust me on this one... if you've watched soap operas or even caught a glimpse of Melrose Place in the 90's, the story will be all too predictable. To make it worse I just found the heroine not all that captivating and the story all too unoriginal. I'm all for overcoming hardships but I literally found myself accurately guessing what would happen next and that's just no fun. Really it wasn't rocket science to guess what would happen next. A heroine longs for the day she gets to marry her handsome, witty, and rugged fiance. Then, another female character who is richer, prettier, blonder, and has larger bosoms than our heroine comes along........ well really, its not rocket science what her purpose is in the story or what the author will build up to. Just think of what happens in your mother's soap operas to keep the good girl away from her man and you've pretty much got the story down.For what it's worth, historical fiction is my great love and I am constantly in search of books with intriguing and strong female characters. I am a fan of such novels as Slammerkin, the Thirteenth Tale, the Birth House, Alias Grace, Forever Amber, Pillars of the Earth, the Vanishing Point, Fingersmith, etc. and often I check out amazon to read reviews that would help me make up my mind about which books to purchase next and I really must say that if you're looking for something better that your run-of-the mill soap opera romance please, please think twice before you buy this one. I wrote this review because as a student I do not have a lot of money to spare on books for leisure and this book really left a bad taste in my mouth as I was completely deceived by the wonderful reviews it got. On the other hand, if a historical romance containing all the beloved cliches that many people seem to enjoy is what you're looking for then by all means please grab a copy as soon as you can. Donnelly is masterful with words- it is the story itself and the all too predictable plot that I found unbearable.(If you have read the books I listed above and are looking for another historical fiction novel that is up to par, you would be wise to choose Karen Maitland's Company of Liars which has a terrific plot set-up and many great twists and turns to savour and enjoy.)",

Initially, Ms. Donnelly captured the feel of lower-class, Victorian London during the time of Jack the Ripper, and her characters were exciting, fully-realized human beings, not just fictional standbys.Then came part 2...right after the heroine, Fiona's, mother, got killed by Jack the Ripper and Fiona was being pursued by a brute who had her father murdered...and her brother Charlie apparently gets murdered too... and Fiona had to escape to New York, with the convenient help of a rich art dealer on the ship out of Southhampton. And then, Fiona becomes the girlfriend of a millionaire, while bemoaning the fact that she can never feel for this man what she felt for her true love, Joe Bristow -- oh, brother the melodrama, pathos, and unreality came on faster than lightning and thicker than molasses. And somehow a really, really well-written beginning involving the hardworking underbelly of Victorian London deteriorated into a melodramatic revenge plot only worthy of those hoary old Victorian vaudeville shows.The second part of \"The Tea Rose\" was really heartbreaking to me, because the first part opened so strongly. I found myself skimming halfway through the second part, unable to sustain interest, and only really finished the book with a half-hearted interest in order to find out if Joe and Fiona would reconcile their lifelong romance, because I'm a sucker for a good love story (which this was, but only up a point). Fiona became an unreal character, but Joe maintained at least one foot in reality.Three stars for the first section, which is deservedly well written; NO stars for the second section which decends into the worst sort of pathetic unbelieveable nonsense.",

Fiona Finnegan our heroine is completely unencumbered by 19th century sensibilities, she seemed like a 21st century girl.I don't want to be a book snob... but this is not typically the type of book that I read. However, I did enjoy it. I enjoyed the thread involving Jack the Ripper, I enjoyed the unexpected surprises, I enjoyed the history of the period and certainly would have enjoyed more of that. I enjoyed the sweet, sappy romance, however I would have preferred less sexually explicit love scenes. I thought they detracted from the quality of the story.It was a bit predictable and rather unbelievable but still enjoyable none the less. I would make the comparison to Danielle Steele, this is similar but better. And I think people who read this type of fiction would probably love this book. By this 'type' of fiction I mean those formula novels that always seem to end the same way...Nicholas Sparks, Danielle Steele, etc.I recently read Jennifer Donnelly's A Northern Light, which I enjoyed very much (the quality was a bit higher). I wanted to read her latest novel The Winter Rose (which I recently purchased through bookcloseouts on line).

Smilla is not always a nice person; most of the time her past envelopes her present and makes her almost unlikeable. The other characters in the novel, the mechanic, her father, the coroner and the blind linguist are so well written that you begin to feel that you know them. I can't agree with the 2/3's assessment,because I find it gripping to the end, even though I have read it many times. The atmosphere of Copenhagen in winter, the language of snow and ice, and the mystery surrounding a young boy's death may not move ahead like an American mystery, but the slow unraveling of the plot is perfect for a novel set in a country where life is lived at a different pace than ours.",

One of the quotes on the back cover (from The New Yorker) puts this novel `...in the league of Melville or Conrad' - while I'm not sure I would go quite that far, Heg is a fine writer, and his talents for keeping the reader in suspense as he spins this tale are pretty impressive.The central character, Smilla, is of mixed Greenlandic and Danish parentage - and the conflicts between those two cultures, one colonial, one native, are alive within her constantly. The dialectic that exists between these two forces - which has so often transformed and rent the fabric of human society - tears at her life. She is a strong-willed, intelligent woman who is not really sure what she wants or expects from life - she trusts her instincts, but not necessarily her heart. When she comes upon the body of her six-year-old neighbor Isaiah crumpled in the snow outside their apartment building, dead from a fall from the roof, she is immediately suspicious - and when the police almost instantly rule the death an accident, Smilla's initial doubts increase. They continue to do so almost exponentially as she begins to look into the case - and her investigation leads her into one dangerous situation after another.The author balances the emotional with the sociological and the scientific elements nicely in this story - there are plenty of references to Smilla's inability to trust, and to love (and the reasons that lurk behind), background on the treatment of the Inuit people by the Danes (both in Greenland and in Denmark), and plenty of science as well. The author has done his homework. In the note about the author, it's mentioned that before turning to writing, he worked as a professional dancer, an actor, a sailor, a fencer and a mountaineer - and it's pretty evident that he pursued these activities with attention and zeal. You can see elements from several of them within this work.The writing is intelligent, and flows very nicely - and Heg is masterful in giving away just what he wants to give away as the story progresses. Fans of the literary thriller should give this novel a good, long look.",

Yes, Smilla is a strange woman, but perhaps no stranger than any other human being if they are truly honest with themselves. Smilla questions her own humanity and her capacity to love, but answers those doubts in her actions. It is this very honesty combined with her love of snow that makes this book so intriguing. The passages about her chidhood are quite poignant and you can really feel the little girl inside the disappointed adult remembering her mother and understand the effects of loss and cultural schizophrenia. What is most remarkable is that a man tapped so deeply into the emotions that I suspect many women feel about themselves, their childhood and their attempts at adult relationships. The ending was not so much a disappointment as a deferral, as though someone came into the room, told the writer he had to pack to leave on a UFO and had 5 minutes to write the ending. However, in his defense, I truly did not expect Smilla and the Mechanic to go home, get married and have a few kids. The period spent on the ship is more technical and not quite as emotionally intimate as the earlier chapters, and felt credibility was stretched a bit, but it was still a wonderful story.Interestingly, the temperature outside while reading this book was about 60 degrees. Despite polarfleece, heavy socks and a down comforter, I still couldn't get warm. This is a book that stays in your thoughts long after you put it down.",

                "review/text": "Even those writing laudatory reviews, here, ding this truly superior work for having a psychologically, rather than literally, explosive conclusion. I can only suggest that Hoeg is an author for whom theme is ever unfolding through his characters, and it is the characters to whom we must look here.The character of Smilla, the heroine of this novel, is developed with such nurturing and painstaking clarity and depth that she is breathtaking. She is so sharply defined that even the remarkable mystery in which we meet her becomes secondary. This book is a work of art of the highest order and it may be read for style alone.But make no mistake, this is a compelling story, which is intellectually demanding of the reader.&quot;Smilla's Sense...&quot; is a story of the strength and determination required by social outsiders in sussing out the underlying motivations of people involved in normative systems of control, and protecting themselves from those systems and the people maintaining them. This novel is about power and survival. Like all of Hoeg's other novels, especially &quot;Borderliners&quot;, &quot;Smilla&quot; takes us on a journey describing characters traveling the real and emotional dialectic of moving away from the social center as they are drawn into a deeper understanding of its aims and of its archetypes. Smilla discovers not just facts, but the mythos underlying them.&quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot; is an ontology of the marginalized psyche interlaced within a remarkable story of the lengths to which a system can be bent towards the individual ambition for power and control.I hate to make comparisons, but a good summer's serious reading list might include this novel with titles such as Morrison's &quot;Song of Solomon&quot;, Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendelum&quot; and DeLillo's &quot;Libra&quot;.",

                "review/text": "I read all the reviews before writing my own because I was curious about the general consensus. People complained about the unsatisfactory ending, what they perceived as the author's intellectual showboating, as well as the narcissistic, cold-hearted selfishness of the main character. I understand the criticism leveled at the ending; I was looking for more resolution in terms of the main character's relationship to her rootless life, but ultimately I accepted that as part of the book, for better or for worse. On the other two counts I couldn't disagree more. What might be taken for pretentiousness is perhaps the author's expertise in many wide-ranging interests. And as for the main character--well, that was what drew me to this book and made it one of my all-time favorites. What I found interesting in the negative reviews was the almost angry vehemence with which readers built their case.I first read this literary thriller when it was published in 1993. Smilla Jaspersen--half Greenlander, half Dane, an unconventional loner and brilliant scientist who struggles with her conflicted upbringing--is devastated when a young boy she has befriended mysteriously falls to his death from the roof of their apartment building. Unsatisfied that it was an accident, she follows a trail from Copenhagen to the bleak Arctic reaches to solve his murder. Since that time I've probably read it a half a dozen times--and not for the incantatory power of the prose. Don't get me wrong--the writing is terrific and the story is compelling, complex, and extraordinarily well-plotted--but what gripped me most about this book was the main character. And she still grips me.Smilla is undoubtedly the first contemporary fictional female character who isn't a wife, mother, saint, or a whore. Imagine a grown-up cross between Nancy Drew and Pippi Longstocking--if they'd been kicked out of every school they ever attended, hitchhiked around the world, maybe did some low-level smuggling, and somewhere along the way managed to pick up a couple of graduate degrees. Smilla is clever, bold, smart, independent, funny, adventurous, slightly reckless, and feels no qualms about telling the men who get in her way to shove off. She's a boat-rocker, whistle-blower, a rule-breaker who thumbs her nose at authority and refuses to submit, like a well-behaved girl, to the ancillary role society would like her to play (e.g., wife, mother, saint, whore). Which, of course, drive the men whose power she challenges into a fury that makes them want to annihilate her. The irony is that she was created by a man.But Smilla's rebellion does not come without intense self-scrutiny and the painful knowledge that she's a lone wolf; at one despairing point in the book she even calls herself a loser. She admits her freakishness, the fact that she cannot find deep connections with others. She usually refrains from getting involved with men because she's terrified of becoming too dependent, of losing herself. She's terrified of being vulnerable, of being loved, of being left. And yet despite all of her fears she plods forward. She laments her inability to make a permanent place for herself in the world, and yet that doesn't deter her from what she feels is her duty--to solve the death of a little boy who may be the one person to whom she had what came close to a true connection. But the greater, unspoken challenge is how to live in the world as a black sheep, particularly if you are a woman.Perhaps the intense dislike some feel towards Smilla stems from her daring to challenge the established structure of society which, despite all the advancements women have made, still places men on top and women underneath. Men dislike her because they can't abide a woman who doesn't know her second place; women dislike her because it forces them to address the power they give away by seeking validation from men. Plus, the world does not show any love for those who tell the truth or root out corruption--they are, more often than not, eliminated in one way or other. And yet, without those who exposed secrets or took the unpopular stand, who took the heat and bucked convention, we'd still be toiling in some medieval gloom.I also loved how Hoeg, in comparing Denmark to Greenland, underscores how the \"progress\" and \"development\" of the modern world have all but destroyed the integrity of ancient cultures, the beauty of the wilderness, and the deeply-ingrained rituals that lend meaning to life as well as binding people together. He weaves examples into the main plot as a kind of elegy to the world as it was before man's maniacal drive to improve it. Some improvements come to mind that did indeed improve the quality of life for mankind--fire, penicillin, and efficient farming methods--but there are so many more that can only make you weep.Now, if only America would produce a heroine as bold, rebellious, and independent as Smilla Jaspersen--and her little sister, Lisbeth Salander.",

                "review/text": "This novel that I wanted very much to like, and which came highly recommended by readers whom I respect. However, even though I tried and tried again, I simply could not get into Smila's Sense of Snow.At first I thought I just wasn't getting it so I redoubled my efforts. The slow pacing, the symbolism, the endless philosophical musing - is there a point? Or am I just missing it? But in the end, this is a novel that tries to be everything at once but simply ends up spinning its wheels.Hoeg tries a bit of everything, from veiled psychological motives to philosophy to action scenes complete with fiery explosions, and even a bit of sci-fi - but the net effect is simple boredom. It was sheer determination that kept me turning the pages. Summary: boring, pretentious, overwritten, unbelievable. Hoeg tries to pull the wool over our eyes hoping we'll mistake the glacial pacing and opaque philoso-babble for profound thought. Thoughtful readers won't be fooled.",
