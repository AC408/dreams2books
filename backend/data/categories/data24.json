        "description": "More than three and a half centuries have passed since the Peace of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War (1618-48); but this most devastating of wars in the early modern period continues to capture the imagination of readers: this book reveals why. It was one of the first wars where contemporaries stressed the importance of atrocities, the horrors of the fighting and also the sufferings of the civilian population. The Thirty Years' War remains a conflict of key importance in the history of the development of warfare and the 'military revolution'.",

                "review/text": "This is quite simply one of the finest works of history produced by an English or American historian during the twentieth century. It occupies a place of honor on my bookshelf alongside the works of Steven Runciman, Peter Green, and C. Vann Woodward.Wedgwood's book has three great virtues: (1) the clarity and directness of her analysis; (2) her extensive research in a wide variety of incredibly obscure sources in many different languages; and (3) her remarkable gifts as a literary stylist. She writes beautiful, classic English prose and has a genius for portraiture. Moreover, she has visited many of the sites of the events in question and her feel for the physical background of the story is a particularly engaging part of the book.To most history lovers, the Thirty Years' War is an obscure and impenetrable thicket considered too much trouble to explore. But Wedgwood recognized that it was one of the decisive episodes in early modern European history. It delayed the unification of Germany by two centuries; began the slow relative decline of Austrian power; paved the way for France's superpower status under Louis XIV; and accelerated Spain's decay into the sick man of eighteenth-century Europe.One of the other reviewers suggested that Wedgwood's account was marked at times by debatable interpretations influenced by 1930's pacifism. I can see where that idea might come from, but I disagree with it. Certainly, one of Wedgwood's concerns is why the statesmen of the time were repeatedly unable to bring an end to this horribly destructive war, which took on a life of its own that defeated the original intentions of just about all of the participants (much like the Great War of Wedgwood's youth). But in contrast to a lot of other people in England in the mid-1930's, Wedgwood recognized the Nazi regime as the unmitigated evil that it was. Her book seems to have been written in part to explore how it was that Germany's past history had produced the country's monstrous new regime.I also have a slight disagreement with the suggestion by another reviewer that Wedgwood skimps on military history. The major battles -- particularly Breitenfeld, Nordlingen and Rocroi -- are discussed here in vivid and memorable terms. But Wedgwood doesn't make dramatic battle descriptions an end in themselves. To Wedgwood, the outcome of battles is important insofar as it affected the balance of political forces and thereby made it impossible at a series of critical points to bring the war to an end.Finally, I have to quote some representative passages to show Wedgwood's gift for language and deft portraits of the major participants. This is perhaps my favorite of the latter:\"General and private opinion flattered the archduke [Ferdinand II]'s virtues, but not his ability. Kindly contemptuous, the greater number of his contemporaries wrote him off as a good-natured simpleton wholly under the control of his chief minister Ulrich von Eggenburg. Yet Ferdinand's apparent lack of personal initiative may have been a pose . . . . He does not appear to have taken political advice from his confessors, and his subjection to the Church did not prevent him from laying violent hands on a Cardinal and defying the Pope in pursuit of what he himself felt to be right. Repeatedly in the course of his life he twisted disaster into advantage, wrenched unexpected safety out of overwhelming danger, snatched victory from defeat. His contemporaries, unimpressed, commented on his astonishing luck. If it was luck, it was indeed astonishing.\"Here is her elegy for the power of imperial Spain following the disastrous battle of Rocroi:\"It was the end of the Spanish army. The cavalry survived, but they were so broken in discipline and morale as to be useless without that splendid infantry which had been the strength of the army. They had not lost their reputation at Rocroy, as the Swedes had done at Nordlingen, but they had died to keep it. . . . In the centre of their position on the fields before Rocroy there stands today a little modern monument, an unassuming grey monolith, the gravestone of the Spanish army; almost, one might say, the gravestone of Spanish greatness.\"",

                "review/text": "This is by far the best book ever written on the Thirty Years war and this judgement is unlikely to change very soon. Wedgewood is one of the 20th century's distiguished historians. This book was written and published during WWII and as such this gives the works a sense of dramatic urgency. Wedgewood saw clear parallels between what happened in the 17th century and what was happening to Europe in the 1940s. The Jesuits for example are referred to as &quot;the storm troopers of the counter-Reformation.Wedgewood's sympathies are clearly with the Protestants and there is no doubt who the hero of the book is, Gustavus Adolphus, who is in nearly every way portrayed positively. That is not to say that this is a flaw with the book, rather it is a strength. In these days of sprin doctors, it sometimes seems difficult to realize that good press was sometimes earned and deserved.It would be too difficult to try and summarize the book in the space provided. In a nutshell, the Thirty Years war evolved into a general European conflict (with the English sitting this one out) due to many of the unresolved issues of the previous century. The Hapsburgs of Austria wanted to dominate the Holy Roman Empire, France wanted to contain the Spainish and Austrian branches, and Sweden was on its way to becoming a world power (for at least the next 100 years). The reason the war went on for so long was that no one really had the strength to land a decisive blow. Oddly enough whenever a power did come close some disaster would over take the army and the powers would have to start over again. Supplying, paying and feeding armies in the field was probably the most problematical undertaking of the entire conflict, along with finding the funds to continue the war for yet another year.Wedgewood masterfully is able to describe a number of personalities, political situations and religious conflicts to give a real sense of both the era and the people who made it.",

                "review/text": "Geoffrey Parker is quite simply one of the most thoughtful and talented military historians out there. His works are always profound and thought-provoking. However, in this instance, he may have bitten off more than he can chew.The ugly fact is that the Thirty Years' War is a conflict of incredible complexity. No one book can capture all elements of this war. It is quite simply the historian's Gordian Knot, and even Parker cannot do it all in one book.The bottom line? If you are a military historian, this is a very good book. However, Parker's own &quot;The Military Revolution&quot; and Dodge's classic biography of Gustavus Adolphus (really a history of European military tactics from 1600-1712) do the job better, especially as compliments to one another. For a political history, Ronald Asch does a better job in his history of the Thirty Years' War from the Hapsburg perspective(especially when combined with the Dodge book on Gustavus). In contrast, Parker's political history gets buried beneath too much detail (thereby running the risk of missing the forest for the trees).Folks, don't let the complexity of the Thirty Years' War scare you. It is a fascinating conflict, one that is essential to understanding European history, military evolution and the emergence of the modern state. If you've got the stomach to read two or more books on the subject, you will be richly rewarded. Taken in conjunction with other works, Parker's book can add enormously to one's understanding of a seminal event in world history.",

                "review/text": "This book is a concise introduction to the Thirty Years War. It is written primarily by Geoffrey Parker, though he recruited expert colleagues to assist on some chapters. Parker is a careful editor, as the book has a uniform style and reads like a single author text. I suspect its target audience is advanced undergraduates, and grad students and scholars specializing in other areas seeking an entry into the extensive literature on the Thirty Years War. It is not a comprehensive and detailed narrative history. Military history aficionados, in particular, will be disappointed because there is little coverage of campaigns and battles. There is, however, a nice chapter analyzing the nature of warfare during the Thirty Years War. The book is devoted primarly to political history, diplomatic history, and the structural effects of the Thirty Years War on the European State System and the organization of individual states. These topics are addressed very well. Of particular interest to the authors is the question of why the Thirty Years War lasted so long. Wars were very common in Early Modern Europe both before and after this conflict but usually of shorter duration. The answer(s) appear to be a combination of factors including changes in military technology, the organizational immaturity of states that precluded decisive victory, the religous dimension of the war, and unwillingness of key actors to compromise. Often presented as a pointless and exhausting conflict, the Thirty Years War did produce lasting effects; for example, the Austrian Hapsburgs would never again try to impose hegemony on Germany. In exchange, however, their grip on the core lands of Austria, Bohemia, and Hungary tightened. The alliance between the Austrian and Spanish Hapsburgs was severed and France emerged as the preeminent continental European Power. One aspect that the authors slight is the international, indeed, intercontinental aspects of the Thirty Years War. Implicit in the narrative is the fact that events all over the world, such as conflict between the Dutch and Spanish/Portugese in South America, and Ottoman-Persian rivalries in the Near East had a huge impact on the Thirty Years War. A very attractive feature is an excellent annotated bibliography written by Professor Parker that will take interested readers deeper into the literature. This book fulfills its goal of being a concise introduction but there is still a need for a substantial narrative history based on modern scholarship.",

                "review/text": "Halfway through this splendid book and a third of the way through this dreadful war, the reader confronts Germany as a wasteland: its crops ravaged or burnt or trampled, its peasantry slaughtered or starved or dead of disease. One might well expect that the combatants, even if they had reached no closure, would fall back exhausted. But no: there was worse to come-another 18 years of pillage and devastation until at last the participants, by now nearly bled dry, at last reconciled themselves, if not to an understanding, then at least to go home. Oddly enough the Peace of Westphalia, which at last brought the conflict to a conclusion, came in time to serve as a template for the modern political world.This latter fact might be reason enough to read C. V. Wedgewood's classic account of the conflict. But there is a happier reason, and that is that her exposition is, from start to finish, a delight. In his introduction, Grafton calls her \"the greatest narrative historian of [the 20th Century,\" and it is hard to quarrel with him: she is brisk precise, compassionate, mordant and energeticHaving said this, it is no contradiction to say that her story doesn't really gain traction until the coming of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, the man who, as it is said, secured the permanent establishment of Protestantism on the continent. Gustavus is the only character to get a chapter of his own and from Wedgewood, the fullest personal description. \"Coarsely made and immensely strong, he was slow and rather clumsy in movement, but he could swing a spade or pick-axe with any sapper in his army. ...\" Wedgewood goes on for several pages like this. It is all good reading, and in the end, it is not quite hero-worship: no matter how much she may seem to admire Gustavus (and perhaps, to a much lesser extent, some of the other protagonists), still in the end the primary focus of her attention is on the German peasants-the poor pawns, battered and abused, in this miserable contention. Nobody knows how much population Germany lost in the Thirty Years' War: some estimates say 40 percent. Whatever the number, it is hard to imagine any feats of heroism or achievements of policy than justify all the bloodshed and is fortune.Grafton says Wedgewood writes like Gibbon. In the end she writes like herself, but against Gibbon, a better comparison might be Tacitus: Ferdinand \"was no a clever man but he had a certain unconscious ability for appropriating the ideas of clever men.\" John George of Saxony \"had been known to sit at table gorging homely foods and swilling native beer for seven hours on end, his sole approach at conversation to box his dwarf's ears or to pour the dregs of a tankard over a servant's head as a signal for more. ... [H]e drank too much and too often. ... It made diplomacy difficult.\" Gustavus (again) \"had, like many great leaders, an unlimited capacity for self-deception. In his own eyes the Protestant champion, in Richelieu's eyes a convenient instrument against the House of Austria, he was in sober fact the protagonist of Swedish expansion on German soil. Sweden stood to gain. Protestantism stood to gain, but the German people stood to lose.\"\"Just imagine,\" someone said, \"if Gustavus had not taken a bullet at Lutzen in 1632, we might have a Lutherana Pope!\" Maybe. Instead we are left with a heritage no less durable for being unintended: the system of nation-states, with individual sovereignty and at least the rudiments of religious freedom-also, perhaps, the notion that nothing is worth fighting for quite this much, and that we are often better off just cultivating our garden.And yet a final irony is that Wedgewood published her first edition with the echoes of Hitler's rhetoric in her ears. In an almost unexampled instance of contemporaneous comment, she remarks that \"three centuries have smoothed every scar from [the] placid landscape, even as the philosophy of the new Germany [sc., in 1937] has submerged the spiritual landmark. `Freedom of belief for all the world'-forgotten yearning of an age forgotten among men who have no choice but to believe what they are told.\"",

Novices to the topic might also wish to consult his \"Europe in Crisis\" or \"Dutch Revolt\" texts. It's difficult to find a good and unbiased investigation into the Catholic/Habsburg side elsewhere. The \"one star\" review is a gross misjudgement - it goes without saying that a book of this type may be too complex for someone with no experience at all with the seventeenth century, but a history can't spend all of its time on explanatory hand-holding. As for stylistic criticism, it's difficult to find history as good as Parker's written as well, let alone better.If Parker is too \"complex,\" \"boring\" or \"complicated,\" it is likely that the topic simply will not be of interest to you no matter who writes it.

                "review/text": "Wedgewood's history was written in 1938, when the German states were \"reunified\" under under Nazi rule into the \"Third Reich\", so she approaches the question of the 30-year civil war of the \"First Reich\", or Holy Roman Empire, from this perspective. She refers to the monument still standing on the battlefield of Breitenfeld, which commemorates the struggle for \"freedom of belief\", as a forgotten relic of a bygone age. However, she added the footnotes and the bibliographical endnote to this edition in the 1960s, so the references were updated to that time.It still has a well-deserved reputation of being a solid factual account of the war, which was insanely complex as well as terrifyingly violent. As with most historians of her era, she concentrates on the narrative facts: who raised an army from where, where they marched it to, who they met, the battles they fought, and the results. However, its great strength is that she adds short but pithy character sketches of the main protagonists, which are good enough to be helpful, and opinionated enough to be intriguing. This prevents the story from getting bogged down, and holds the reader's interest well. At times she also goes into details of the collapse of civil society, and the horrific human consequences of the war, but perhaps not as much as a more modern author probably would have.As with many popular works, she has a strong set of opinions, amounting really to a bias, but as with any popular work, this also helps to keep the reader's interest, whether you agree or disagree with her. For her, the Austrian and Imperial ruling family, the Habsburgs, can almost do no wrong. When Ferdinand II or Ferdinand III demand new rights and powers as the emperors of the the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, she describes them as taking the normal sorts of steps that political leaders did at the time, who were always seeking to enhance their own grandeur. Of course, she has a point, that we cannot so easily judge an historical political figure by the standards of our own day. Nevertheless, when anyone opposed to the Habsburgs resists, she describes them as rashly putting the unity of the German nation at risk. When anyone other than the Habsburgs seeks to enhance their own power within the empire, they are, for her, recklessly endangering the nation to further their personal ambition. Characters like Maximilian of Bavaria and Wallenstein, are, for her, acting wisely in the empire's best interests while they are fighting for the Habsburgs, but when they deviate from their alliance, they are succumbing to personal ambition and endangering the prospects of peace and Geman unity. After each great defeat for the Protestant cause, she describes their despair with gusto, and describes the elation of the Habsburgs and the Catholics with glee. When crucial battles go the other way, she often tends to mitigate the consequences.Her spin on the events does not detract however from one's enjoyment, and it is the first account of the war I have read that lays out the sequence of events with such clarity and detail. In fact, her account is factual and detailed enough for a fair observer to be able to conclude at the end, despite all her spin, that the war was started primarily by the Austrian Habsburgs' determination to enhance their power by bluster, legal pressure, and if that failed, by sheer armed violence. The Austrian Habsburgs stood firmly in the way of any peace agreement, and succeeded at different times in alienating all their supporters, including their relatives in Spain, and even the Pope. The war only finally ended when the supply of funds from the Habsburgs' Spanish colonies dried up, and the Habsburg crown was bankrupt. Even so, her criticism of the unreasonableness of the Swedes, the other German princes, the Dutch, the French, and the free German cities, is not always misplaced.As the book goes on, she gives brief descriptions of the famines, the plagues, the massacres, and the other terrifying consequences, showing the kind of pacifist sadness of the pity of war common to her era. The consequences of the Thirty Years War were so horrific that they need little embellishment to cause shock, and it almost staggers belief that a whole population of such a size could be brought to such a level of desperation and suffering. Alhtough she could have given more detail here, this kind of digression into social history was not conventional for a historian of her era, and there are many other books which cover that.I'd found Schiller's history of the war hard to follow, and Wedgewood filled the gap quite nicely. One of the best parts of the book is the first few chapters, where she gives a lively description of the constitution of the Holy Roman Empire, and a description of the constitutions of the different states, the nature of the differing religious sects, and the personalities of the main protagonists. This is essential for understanding what comes next and why people acted as they did. Without this description, the entire story is hard to follow. The book is worth getting for this section alone, but the rest is also good.",

                "review/text": "For the English-language reader Wedgwood's book, which has been in print for over sixty years, is still an excellent introduction and synoptic narrative of this lengthy and turbulent period of European history. It gives brief and judicious biographical sketches of the major political and military actors of three generations: The principal antagonists at the outset -- Ferdinand II of Austria and Frederick V, Elector Palatine; the condottieri-style generals - Spinola, von Mansfeld, Tilly, Wallenstein, Piccolomini, Christian of Halberstadt, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the duc d'Enghien (Conde); the contentious minor rulers -- Maximilian V of Bavaria, Johann Georg of Saxony; the northern monarchs -- Christian IV of Denmark and Gustavus Adophus of Sweden (and his daughter Christina and prime minister, Oxenstierna); the \"spoiler\", Cardinal Richelieu; the new Emperor Ferdinand III and his cousin, the warlord Cardinal-Infant Ferdinand of Spain; and many others. This book is written in a traditional English historian's prose style that is clear, eloquent and totally lacking the jargon of concurrent and later social and economic histories, while still covering these aspects of the period. In spite of some reviewers' claims of a \"Protestant bias\" in her interpretation, the author seems extremely fair when assessing responsibility for the long-running disaster of the war, taking the position that it was the self-serving political interests of the participants (dynasties, rulers, generals and paymasters) that kept the war going at the expense of the social and economic welfare of the vast majority of inhabitants of Germany and Bohemia.Although I am not familiar with this new edition (and Grafton's introduction) I emphasize that any reissuing of this book should have a brief scholarly introduction which supplies more details on the constitutional arrangements and crises of the Holy Roman Empire during the sixteenth century, with a special emphasis on the composition of the Bohemian estates and the conflicts between the estates and the Habsburg king-emperors. The extent and internal organization of \"the Bohemian crown lands\" should also be outlined. A succinct review of the political status of Lutheranism, Calvinism, the Bohemian Brethren, and other Protestant confessions throughout all of Europe around the year 1600 and a note on how their status had altered by 1700 would also be useful in \"setting the stage\" for the events of 1618 and understanding the relgious-denomination consequences of the war.The author supplies sufficient details on the major battles, but this is not a work of military history. As Wedgwood knows, battles were only significant in the larger view as a result of their political consequences. And it is in the elucidation of the underlying politics of the war (including how political prospects shifted with the waxing and waning of military fortunes) that Wedgwood excels. In her analysis of the general European situation at the outset of the war she proposes that there were three sets of forces which underlay and drove contemporary events. Each was a source of conflict and each might cross-cut the others, complicating the declared interests and objectives of the dynasties and nations involved. In brief, the forces were: (a) Religion, with three major competing factions (Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist; she notes that the conflict between the latter two forms of Protestantism was often as extreme as it was between each of them and the Roman Catholic Church). (b) Nationalism (French, German, Czech, etc.), which was a new force on the scene, crystallizing the idea that political entities might be defined by nationality (which here equals some combination of ethnicity and native language) rather than conceived of as polyglot territorial agglomerations brought about by dynastic interests. (c) Monarchic-constitutional issues, which were especially complicated and ambiguous within the \"constitutional\" grouping of major and minor powers known as The Holy Roman Empire (HRE).The constitutional problem was twofold. Within the small arenas of developing nation states and the yet smaller ones of traditional rulerships throughout Europe (duchies, counties, \"free-city\" areas ruled by town councils and mayors) contests over the basis and extent of the rulers' powers and privileges were taking place. Aristocrats, oligarchs and merchants had traditional corporate bodies (estates) reluctant to cede their own powers (taxation, the organization of military service) to a central authority. The same conflict was also being played out on the larger scale of the Hly Roman Epire, that loose grouping of special obligations and exemptions which was the final residue of an earlier system of vassalage binding together the elected Emperor (who had been a Habsburg for several centuries) and the smaller rulerships of Central Europe. The religious reforms, rebellions and wars of the sixteenth century had produced a system that appeared to resolve some of the potential problems through the won privilege of cujus regio, eius religio (\"whoever rules, his religion [is the religion of the ruled area]\"). In the year of the war's inception, 1618, this new balance was very fragile, comprising four Catholic and three Protestant imperial Electors. In Germany the special arrangements regulating relationships between the Emperor (resident in Vienna or Prague) and local rulers and guaranteeing a great deal of political autonomy to the locals, especially the Protestant Electors, had been somewhat codified by the Augsburg Treaty of 1555, and were known as the \"German Liberties\". These would prove to be especially important to the three Protestant Electors at the outset of the war.In the developing continental war one could be pro- or anti-Habsburg based on any one of the above factors or any combination of two or three of them. For example, a Catholic ruler (including the papacy) might seek Protestant allies in order to combat Habsburg territorial expansion in his direction or to combat constitutional changes in the Empire which affected his position adversely. Or a Protestant power might accept the Habsburg \"program\" in any given case because it did not wish to disturb constitutional arrangements that were to its advantage (this characterization is apt for Saxony and Brandenburg during the first twelve years of the war.)As Wedgwood notes, all three considerations (religion, nationality, constitutional relations) could be and were used cynically to advance the positions and interests of individual rulers and factions. From the point of view of rationality or predictability, political choices and commitments were often self-contradictory (e.g., a Catholic power supporting a Protestant venture; a German Liberties party accepting occupation by the army of a foreign power, etc.) or temporary expedients that made the overall European situation more chaotic. The war began locally in Bohemia, but its complications and consequences radiated outward as far west as Spain and England (even farther, to the Caribbean naval theater), as far north as Sweden and northeast to Poland, as far south as Italy and southeast as Transylvania; in other words, it was a European continental war with global impact.When the war broke out in 1618 it was over the Habsburg violation of a \"constitutional guarantee\" of religious freedom in Bohemia (the concessions stated in Rudolf II's Letter of Majesty). And here is where individual personalities and beliefs played an important role. Ferdinand II, who had knowingly violated the terms of the Letter soon after being selected by the Bohemian Diet as King (and therefore the first in precedence of the HRE Electors) was determined not only to expand the political powers of the Habsburg dynasty in Bohemia and elsewhere, he was firmly committed to the goals of the Catholic Counter-Reformation (i.e., re-Catholicizing all of the areas within the HRE which had become Protestant during the last one hundred years). When he was deposed by a special convention of the Bohemian estates (the defenestration of his deputies in Prague being the signal event of this deposition), the crown of Bohemia was offered to the Elector of the (Rhineland) Palatinate, Frederick V, who considered himself a champion of the Protestant cause. The religious zeal of these two antagonists led to extreme fixed positions at the very outset of the war.Given the other major conflict hovering in the background -- the Spanish Habsburg determination to recover the now Protestant area of the Netherlands which had become the successful and defiant (Dutch) United Provinces - the war soon became international. While the entry of France and then Denmark followed by Sweden, into the war during the 1620's changed its nature and extended its duration, Wedgwood concentrates much of her analysis on the behavior of the two Protestant Electors, Johann Georg of Saxony and Georg Wilhelm of Brandenburg and one Catholic ruler, Maximilian of Bavaria. It is her contention throughout the book that Johann Georg and Maximilian in particular could have prevented the war's spread and forced Ferdinand into a compromise very early in the course of events that acquired their own dynamism once they got out of hand. Despite their religious differences these two were always strong \"German Liberties\" proponents, and each had the same view of the Austrian Habsburg rulers: they should be kept for the broader protections they offered, but kept in place with respect to encroachments on the traditional rights of local rulers. In the end both of these rulers survived the lengthy war in spite of numerous diplomatic and military reversals (Saxony switched sides and joined the Swedes for several years, while Maximilian's position was constantly and secretly supported by his nominal enemies, the French, as their potential foot in the Habsburg camp.) Wedgwood believes that the price of their survival was far too costly for the rest of Germany.Wedgwood's gloss on the changing nature of the conflict is that by the year 1635 the war had become one of great-power politics, and that the earlier religious and ideological causes were losing their ability to motivate the antagonists. Her summary of the changes emphasizes the following:(a) Religion had discredited itself as a plausible source of political programs and a legitimate cause for war. Religion was becoming more interiorized and private, and losing ground philosophically and ethically to the new prestige of empirical and applied science (this was the era of Galileo and Kepler, with Descartes, Harvey, Hook, Newton, Huygens, etc. on the near horizon; a time of laboratory science and scientific societies.) As the basis of a political program religion was viewed cynically by those who saw the devastation it had brought about.(b) For thinking men, nationalism began to fill the emotional void in public life left by the withdrawal of religion as the underlying motive for political and cultural action. This was very obvious in France, but even true of Ferdinand III, for whom the new main cause was the construction of an Austrian-based hereditary monarchy whose additional obligations as the Holy Roman Imperial protector of far-flung German Catholics were no longer perceived as worthwhile. In the minds of both Germans and Austrian Habsburgs the Holy Roman Empire was becoming an honorific entity with ambiguous and weak political commitments in Germany. The Elbe-North German-Pomeranian ideal empire of Wallenstein was never again revived as a dynastic program. Austria began to move south and east (toward Italy, Croatia, and Hungary) in its expansionist aims.(c) The control of immense polyglot, multi-religious, mercenary armies and their huge camp followings had become a pressing matter of concern for all of the political authorities that hired them - they were neither religious nor national in their motives and aims and were in fact independent \"mobile states\" unto themselves, cynical and rapacious and often as dangerous to their paymasters as to their foes; whenever their immediate prospects for pay and maintenance looked bad, they changed sides. The most successful mercenary generals had become mini-sovereigns. Officers were all \"out for themselves\" and for their troops (rather than for the cause or nation of their paymaster), since without troop loyalty they had no means of personal advancement -- the most famous commanders, Ernst von Mansfeld, Wallenstein, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the Swedish general Wrangel, all expected (and some received) grants of territory and titles of nobility as their rewards for service. The \"national\" armies of conscripts that came to the fore in the 18th century was the answer to this problem.The pace of the war wound down during its last five years (although there were several major battles fought even then), which was a period of extended negotiatons in M&uuml;nster and Osnabr&uuml;ck, with the \"final treaty\" being signed late in 1648. For the next five years a series of conferences met at N&uuml;rnberg to implement and enforce the peace treaty and to deal with difficult problems raised by demobilizing huge armies. Many of the loans of this period, which were raised to cover the demobilization costs, were not paid off for a century. Individual rulers such as Charles of Lorraine and the Duke of Savoy (who got nothing from the treaty) refused to vacate various fortresses for five or six years, but the war did not break out again. France and Spain continued at war with each other, but not in Germany. Numerous soldiers, especially officers, went into mercenary service all over Europe. Others took to the hills as professional bandits - for the next 20 years merchants traveled through certain parts of Germany and Bohemia in armed caravans.Wedgwood accepts the more recent (1900-1930's) historical estimate that the population of the Imperial German lands (excluding Alsace and the Netherlands) dropped from about 21 million in 1618 to 13 million in 1648. The number of dislocated people was also substantial. While she acknowledges that the number of towns and villages destroyed and other \"infrastructural\" and economic losses were very large, she feels that all contemporary sources (e.g., the pamphlet literature of the next 100 years) exaggerated local losses, since all parties in the war continued to seek indemnities and restitution. The free peasantry benefited briefly, since landowners were desperate for manpower to restore their estates - prices fell while wages rose for a number of years, which increased the standard of living of peasants and artisans. But within a decade of the peace treaty the landowning gentry was pleading with Imperial, royal and local rulers to impose legal restrictions which would re-create bonded, serf-like conditions for peasants. Town councils now became pawns and bureaucrats of the dynastic courts of their rulers and also implemented restrictive legislations on peasants (e.g., prohibitions against mobility, domestic industry, and household craft production -- a trend which later historians refer to as \"neo-serfdom\"). Class stratification was as rigid as it was before the war started. There was a new, large class of mobile petty nobles and gentry seeking court-backed military and bureaucratic appointments, at the expense of town and peasant taxpayers.Germany and the Austrian-based monarchy and empire were totally excluded from the international competition to establish overseas colonies and from the developing \"Atlantic trade\". For a number of years the outlets of Germany's major rivers (Rhine, Elbe, Oder, and for Brandenburg-Prussia, Vistula) were controlled by foreign powers, reducing Germany's commercial strength. Hamburg was the exception, becoming the major maritime merchant city of the North Sea coast, at the expense of the other Hanseatic cities and the Scandinavian powers. The only medium-sized German state to emerge with positive prospects was Brandenburg, soon to become the administratively efficient and militarily powerful Prussia. The peace, while ending the \"wars of religion\", set the stage for a long series of \"nationalistic\" wars that subsumed dynastic and religious sources of conflict. France replaced the Habsburg Spanish-Austrian coalition as the menacing and tyrannical continental power willing to disturb the peace. Austria turned to the south and east and Spain lost its great power status and became an economic and cultural backwater. There was no politically or culturally unified Germany within the boundaries of the old Empire (French culture began to reign supreme) and the cosmopolitanism (its openness to outside influences) of this area during the 18th century, instead of being a source of pride over its achievements, became a source of lament for later cultural and ethnic purists of revived German nationalism.Author's Judgment and Conclusions: In terms of responsibility for the overall disaster, Wedgwood points to the futility and self-destructiveness of sincere religious zeal in the cases of Ferdinand II and the Elector Palatine. But, from the point of view of failures of practical (and ethical) politics, she highlights the behavior of Maximilian and Johann Georg, who could have prevented the spread of the conflict in 1620 and could have brought the war to an early end in 1635 if they had agreed to work together on a \"unified German program\" which would have forced Imperial compromises and concessions had they both stood behind it. Between these two she sees the Saxon as the greater victim of military circumstances (pressed by the Swedish juggernaut) and therefore less culpable for the mess, while she judges the Bavarian as too subtle and too ambitious in pursuit of his own dynastic and territorial ambitions at the expense of a general settlement good for his fellow Germans, thus identifying him as the more culpable.Beautiful in its style and concision, Wedgwood's final summary is also gloomy (as one might expect of a work completed in 1939, on the verge of World War II):\"As there was no compulsion towards a conflict which, in despite of the apparent bitterness of the parties, took so long to engage and needed so much assiduous blowing to fan the flame, so no right was vindicated by its ragged end. The war solved no problem. Its effects, both immediate and indirect, were either negative or disastrous. Morally subversive, economically destructive, socially degrading, confused in its causes, devious in its course, futile in its result, it is the outstanding example in European history of meaningless conflict.\"",

It should also be enough for any historian/reader to buy this volume.An extract of the much larger A History of the United States during the Administrations of Jefferson and Madison published almost a century ago, this history of a war the United States almost lost was originally published by the Infantry Journal at Fort Benning, GA. It was, and still is, the best one volume history of that war.Adams had access to US Government papers and spent almost three years in European archives, many of those references now unfortunately lost because of two world wars. What he gives you is both the military and diplomatic side, and also some interesting views of the events interaction with the larger 'disagreement' going on at the time in Europe centering around Napoleon, Emperor of the French.What you see is what you get. It is a great story, boldly and accurately told that has stood the test of time. It is highly recommended, and the introduction by Col Elting neatly says it all. The best purely military history is Col Elting's Amateurs! To Arms. Taken together they are incredible-two books you will never forget and will read and reread.",

                "review/text": "This volume consists of the chapters taken from Henry Adams lengthy History of the United States. Those chapters dealing with the War of 1812 have been excerpted from the multi-volume set and placed into single volume format here. This is a classic work of its kind, but it is not an easy read. Henry Adams goes into great deatail, and often engages in rhetorical discussions, a common trait of 19th century historians. His wide ranging views of the war brings to light many aspects often not covered in standard histories. This can be a plus as well as minus. Often Adams will go on and on about oragniaztional and political aspects of the conflict which can seem dry to the modern reader.Those looking for detailed descriptions of battles from the war will be somewhat disappointed. Adams does a lot to build up the background of each campaign or battle, but when it comes to the action itself he seems almost anti-climatic. Famous actions like Chippewa and Lundy's Lane are surprisingly short, even though the chapters are lengthy in discussing the admistrative and political aspects of the decision making and troop movements involved.While Adams righly excoriates pitiful American leadership and imcompetence, he is always on the lookout for something positive to say as well. While Hull, Dearborn and Wilkinson are rightly seen as hopeless leaders, Adams also finds fault with Scott, Harrison and Jackson. The emphasis is naturally on the US perspective of the war, where insightful and often scathing observation is made on the inner workings of the Madison administration. British and Canadian strategy gets correspondingly less detail, although there is plenty of criticism of Proctor, Provost and Drummond among others.There is a certain degree of national bias as most American historians have a hard time seeing how truly poor our performance was in this conflict. With Adams it comes down to Americans lacking discipline, but better at killing their enemies. The old American marksmenship fallacy. Adams believes that in most battles Americans inflicted greater losses. This is rather blatant bias here, because if we were to look at battles like Bladensburg we would find that British losses were greater because the Americans usually ran after firing a few good vollies! There were also many actions in which American losses were higher. In fact the overall body count was 8,000 US to 6,000 Anglo-Canadians in this war. Even with New Orleans thrown in US losses were greater overall!This theory of better US markmanship has been put forward in regards to the American Revolutionary battles as well. Americans shot well until the British broke them and they ran. In breaking US troops the British usually had to assault and this is why they often took greater losses. For the British it was also hard to tell about the quality of the US troops opposed to them. In many actions US regulars and militia ran, and in others they fought well like Scott's Brigade. This spotty performance made it hard for the British to tell what kind of opposition they were up against. It resulted in their making some costly frontal attacks expecting that the Americans would break as usual. The US army can be best compared to the Spanish army of the Napoleonic period in this conflict. Overall poor, but with some good units, and largely indifferent leadership.Some of the best chapters deal with the New Orleans 1814 Campaign in which Adams is highly critical of Jackson's actions, giving most credit to the US artillery for winning the action. Jackson's ruthless campaigns against the Creeks and Redsticks are described earlier in the book. Adams makes no appollogies for Jackson's cruelty toward the Indians, finding fault more with his organizational sloppiness than his genicidal tactics. PC readers today might certainly be upset with the Sang-Froid Adams uses to describe these events. Historians had a different emphasis in the past than they do today.The final chapters describing the politics and personalities involved in the Peace of Ghent are also quite rewarding. It is fair to say that whatever American leadership lacked on the battlefield was more than made up for at the peace table. Readers will also find out a lot about the Federalists and their resistence toward the War in New England. The Hartford Convention is often mentioned only in passing with most works on this subject.Adam's work is certainly worthwhile, and the style of writing combined with its analysis is not the kind of histography that we see much anymore. Readers will find some of the chatpters a difficult haul, but the rewards are many for those who persist. The War of 1812 came close to being a major US setback, it was certainly a debacle. That we managed to break even in the end was due more to luck than anything else. This work is a classic study which should be used in combination with more recent works.",

The book starts with the first invasion as it may be said and goes on from there. Its really astounding at the amount of mistakes that were made in this war by the administration, especially on land, in the beginnings of the war and the unfortunate burning of Washington.

Hull, Dearborn, Procter, and James Madison and his cabinet save Monroe). There exists some errors of omission (Coles never explains why Laffite supported Jackson at New Orleans and barely covers the war west of Lake Michigan save for one brief mention).

                "review/text": "The War of 1812, seen through the eyes of Mr. Harry L. Coles, seems to be a war of lost victories, overblown ideas and swift retreats. The idea that the United States of America could win the war, in hindsight, seems down right sad. The US Navy had only 16 ships of any worth. The Army looked good, on paper, but in real life was mostly made up of ill-disciplined militia and untrained regulars who were directed, most of the time, by poor leaders and poor strategy. The government was not able to rise the funds or soldiers needed to carry out the large scale operations the military were dreaming of.But the British and Canadian side had their own problems also. The European military system just did NOT work well in North America. Also, like the Americans, they had problems with communication, transportation and the rising of, training of and equipping of the militia. The British Navy, in the opening stages of the war, found their reputation much tarnished by the American victories. And even with peace breaking out in Europe the British Empire still had to keep an eye on the French and the Russians.This book is a must for any American who wishes to understand how the nation, and government, changed in the early 19th Century. The only flaw, and this is my only issue with the work, is the lack of background for many of the major and minor players of this conflict. While many readers in the USA may know Oliver Perry, Andrew Jackson and Winfield Scott, I am ashamed to say I doubt many know who Henry Procter, Robert Ross or George Cockburn were. Mostly because they were on the other side of a conflict that we think of as a minor one.While the time line and the maps were pretty helpful I think more time spent on filling out the people and places of the conflict would have been a greater help.",

                "review/text": "This is quite simply one of the finest works of history produced by an English or American historian during the twentieth century. It occupies a place of honor on my bookshelf alongside the works of Steven Runciman, Peter Green, and C. Vann Woodward.Wedgwood's book has three great virtues: (1) the clarity and directness of her analysis; (2) her extensive research in a wide variety of incredibly obscure sources in many different languages; and (3) her remarkable gifts as a literary stylist. She writes beautiful, classic English prose and has a genius for portraiture. Moreover, she has visited many of the sites of the events in question and her feel for the physical background of the story is a particularly engaging part of the book.To most history lovers, the Thirty Years' War is an obscure and impenetrable thicket considered too much trouble to explore. But Wedgwood recognized that it was one of the decisive episodes in early modern European history. It delayed the unification of Germany by two centuries; began the slow relative decline of Austrian power; paved the way for France's superpower status under Louis XIV; and accelerated Spain's decay into the sick man of eighteenth-century Europe.One of the other reviewers suggested that Wedgwood's account was marked at times by debatable interpretations influenced by 1930's pacifism. I can see where that idea might come from, but I disagree with it. Certainly, one of Wedgwood's concerns is why the statesmen of the time were repeatedly unable to bring an end to this horribly destructive war, which took on a life of its own that defeated the original intentions of just about all of the participants (much like the Great War of Wedgwood's youth). But in contrast to a lot of other people in England in the mid-1930's, Wedgwood recognized the Nazi regime as the unmitigated evil that it was. Her book seems to have been written in part to explore how it was that Germany's past history had produced the country's monstrous new regime.I also have a slight disagreement with the suggestion by another reviewer that Wedgwood skimps on military history. The major battles -- particularly Breitenfeld, Nordlingen and Rocroi -- are discussed here in vivid and memorable terms. But Wedgwood doesn't make dramatic battle descriptions an end in themselves. To Wedgwood, the outcome of battles is important insofar as it affected the balance of political forces and thereby made it impossible at a series of critical points to bring the war to an end.Finally, I have to quote some representative passages to show Wedgwood's gift for language and deft portraits of the major participants. This is perhaps my favorite of the latter:\"General and private opinion flattered the archduke [Ferdinand II]'s virtues, but not his ability. Kindly contemptuous, the greater number of his contemporaries wrote him off as a good-natured simpleton wholly under the control of his chief minister Ulrich von Eggenburg. Yet Ferdinand's apparent lack of personal initiative may have been a pose . . . . He does not appear to have taken political advice from his confessors, and his subjection to the Church did not prevent him from laying violent hands on a Cardinal and defying the Pope in pursuit of what he himself felt to be right. Repeatedly in the course of his life he twisted disaster into advantage, wrenched unexpected safety out of overwhelming danger, snatched victory from defeat. His contemporaries, unimpressed, commented on his astonishing luck. If it was luck, it was indeed astonishing.\"Here is her elegy for the power of imperial Spain following the disastrous battle of Rocroi:\"It was the end of the Spanish army. The cavalry survived, but they were so broken in discipline and morale as to be useless without that splendid infantry which had been the strength of the army. They had not lost their reputation at Rocroy, as the Swedes had done at Nordlingen, but they had died to keep it. . . . In the centre of their position on the fields before Rocroy there stands today a little modern monument, an unassuming grey monolith, the gravestone of the Spanish army; almost, one might say, the gravestone of Spanish greatness.\"",

                "review/text": "This is by far the best book ever written on the Thirty Years war and this judgement is unlikely to change very soon. Wedgewood is one of the 20th century's distiguished historians. This book was written and published during WWII and as such this gives the works a sense of dramatic urgency. Wedgewood saw clear parallels between what happened in the 17th century and what was happening to Europe in the 1940s. The Jesuits for example are referred to as &quot;the storm troopers of the counter-Reformation.Wedgewood's sympathies are clearly with the Protestants and there is no doubt who the hero of the book is, Gustavus Adolphus, who is in nearly every way portrayed positively. That is not to say that this is a flaw with the book, rather it is a strength. In these days of sprin doctors, it sometimes seems difficult to realize that good press was sometimes earned and deserved.It would be too difficult to try and summarize the book in the space provided. In a nutshell, the Thirty Years war evolved into a general European conflict (with the English sitting this one out) due to many of the unresolved issues of the previous century. The Hapsburgs of Austria wanted to dominate the Holy Roman Empire, France wanted to contain the Spainish and Austrian branches, and Sweden was on its way to becoming a world power (for at least the next 100 years). The reason the war went on for so long was that no one really had the strength to land a decisive blow. Oddly enough whenever a power did come close some disaster would over take the army and the powers would have to start over again. Supplying, paying and feeding armies in the field was probably the most problematical undertaking of the entire conflict, along with finding the funds to continue the war for yet another year.Wedgewood masterfully is able to describe a number of personalities, political situations and religious conflicts to give a real sense of both the era and the people who made it.",

                "review/text": "Halfway through this splendid book and a third of the way through this dreadful war, the reader confronts Germany as a wasteland: its crops ravaged or burnt or trampled, its peasantry slaughtered or starved or dead of disease. One might well expect that the combatants, even if they had reached no closure, would fall back exhausted. But no: there was worse to come-another 18 years of pillage and devastation until at last the participants, by now nearly bled dry, at last reconciled themselves, if not to an understanding, then at least to go home. Oddly enough the Peace of Westphalia, which at last brought the conflict to a conclusion, came in time to serve as a template for the modern political world.This latter fact might be reason enough to read C. V. Wedgewood's classic account of the conflict. But there is a happier reason, and that is that her exposition is, from start to finish, a delight. In his introduction, Grafton calls her \"the greatest narrative historian of [the 20th Century,\" and it is hard to quarrel with him: she is brisk precise, compassionate, mordant and energeticHaving said this, it is no contradiction to say that her story doesn't really gain traction until the coming of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, the man who, as it is said, secured the permanent establishment of Protestantism on the continent. Gustavus is the only character to get a chapter of his own and from Wedgewood, the fullest personal description. \"Coarsely made and immensely strong, he was slow and rather clumsy in movement, but he could swing a spade or pick-axe with any sapper in his army. ...\" Wedgewood goes on for several pages like this. It is all good reading, and in the end, it is not quite hero-worship: no matter how much she may seem to admire Gustavus (and perhaps, to a much lesser extent, some of the other protagonists), still in the end the primary focus of her attention is on the German peasants-the poor pawns, battered and abused, in this miserable contention. Nobody knows how much population Germany lost in the Thirty Years' War: some estimates say 40 percent. Whatever the number, it is hard to imagine any feats of heroism or achievements of policy than justify all the bloodshed and is fortune.Grafton says Wedgewood writes like Gibbon. In the end she writes like herself, but against Gibbon, a better comparison might be Tacitus: Ferdinand \"was no a clever man but he had a certain unconscious ability for appropriating the ideas of clever men.\" John George of Saxony \"had been known to sit at table gorging homely foods and swilling native beer for seven hours on end, his sole approach at conversation to box his dwarf's ears or to pour the dregs of a tankard over a servant's head as a signal for more. ... [H]e drank too much and too often. ... It made diplomacy difficult.\" Gustavus (again) \"had, like many great leaders, an unlimited capacity for self-deception. In his own eyes the Protestant champion, in Richelieu's eyes a convenient instrument against the House of Austria, he was in sober fact the protagonist of Swedish expansion on German soil. Sweden stood to gain. Protestantism stood to gain, but the German people stood to lose.\"\"Just imagine,\" someone said, \"if Gustavus had not taken a bullet at Lutzen in 1632, we might have a Lutherana Pope!\" Maybe. Instead we are left with a heritage no less durable for being unintended: the system of nation-states, with individual sovereignty and at least the rudiments of religious freedom-also, perhaps, the notion that nothing is worth fighting for quite this much, and that we are often better off just cultivating our garden.And yet a final irony is that Wedgewood published her first edition with the echoes of Hitler's rhetoric in her ears. In an almost unexampled instance of contemporaneous comment, she remarks that \"three centuries have smoothed every scar from [the] placid landscape, even as the philosophy of the new Germany [sc., in 1937] has submerged the spiritual landmark. `Freedom of belief for all the world'-forgotten yearning of an age forgotten among men who have no choice but to believe what they are told.\"",

However, she added the footnotes and the bibliographical endnote to this edition in the 1960s, so the references were updated to that time.It still has a well-deserved reputation of being a solid factual account of the war, which was insanely complex as well as terrifyingly violent. As with most historians of her era, she concentrates on the narrative facts: who raised an army from where, where they marched it to, who they met, the battles they fought, and the results. However, its great strength is that she adds short but pithy character sketches of the main protagonists, which are good enough to be helpful, and opinionated enough to be intriguing. This prevents the story from getting bogged down, and holds the reader's interest well. At times she also goes into details of the collapse of civil society, and the horrific human consequences of the war, but perhaps not as much as a more modern author probably would have.As with many popular works, she has a strong set of opinions, amounting really to a bias, but as with any popular work, this also helps to keep the reader's interest, whether you agree or disagree with her. For her, the Austrian and Imperial ruling family, the Habsburgs, can almost do no wrong. When Ferdinand II or Ferdinand III demand new rights and powers as the emperors of the the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, she describes them as taking the normal sorts of steps that political leaders did at the time, who were always seeking to enhance their own grandeur. Of course, she has a point, that we cannot so easily judge an historical political figure by the standards of our own day. Nevertheless, when anyone opposed to the Habsburgs resists, she describes them as rashly putting the unity of the German nation at risk. When anyone other than the Habsburgs seeks to enhance their own power within the empire, they are, for her, recklessly endangering the nation to further their personal ambition. Characters like Maximilian of Bavaria and Wallenstein, are, for her, acting wisely in the empire's best interests while they are fighting for the Habsburgs, but when they deviate from their alliance, they are succumbing to personal ambition and endangering the prospects of peace and Geman unity. After each great defeat for the Protestant cause, she describes their despair with gusto, and describes the elation of the Habsburgs and the Catholics with glee. When crucial battles go the other way, she often tends to mitigate the consequences.Her spin on the events does not detract however from one's enjoyment, and it is the first account of the war I have read that lays out the sequence of events with such clarity and detail. In fact, her account is factual and detailed enough for a fair observer to be able to conclude at the end, despite all her spin, that the war was started primarily by the Austrian Habsburgs' determination to enhance their power by bluster, legal pressure, and if that failed, by sheer armed violence. The Austrian Habsburgs stood firmly in the way of any peace agreement, and succeeded at different times in alienating all their supporters, including their relatives in Spain, and even the Pope. The war only finally ended when the supply of funds from the Habsburgs' Spanish colonies dried up, and the Habsburg crown was bankrupt. Even so, her criticism of the unreasonableness of the Swedes, the other German princes, the Dutch, the French, and the free German cities, is not always misplaced.As the book goes on, she gives brief descriptions of the famines, the plagues, the massacres, and the other terrifying consequences, showing the kind of pacifist sadness of the pity of war common to her era. The consequences of the Thirty Years War were so horrific that they need little embellishment to cause shock, and it almost staggers belief that a whole population of such a size could be brought to such a level of desperation and suffering. Alhtough she could have given more detail here, this kind of digression into social history was not conventional for a historian of her era, and there are many other books which cover that.I'd found Schiller's history of the war hard to follow, and Wedgewood filled the gap quite nicely. One of the best parts of the book is the first few chapters, where she gives a lively description of the constitution of the Holy Roman Empire, and a description of the constitutions of the different states, the nature of the differing religious sects, and the personalities of the main protagonists. This is essential for understanding what comes next and why people acted as they did. Without this description, the entire story is hard to follow. The book is worth getting for this section alone, but the rest is also good.",

                "review/text": "For the English-language reader Wedgwood's book, which has been in print for over sixty years, is still an excellent introduction and synoptic narrative of this lengthy and turbulent period of European history. It gives brief and judicious biographical sketches of the major political and military actors of three generations: The principal antagonists at the outset -- Ferdinand II of Austria and Frederick V, Elector Palatine; the condottieri-style generals - Spinola, von Mansfeld, Tilly, Wallenstein, Piccolomini, Christian of Halberstadt, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the duc d'Enghien (Conde); the contentious minor rulers -- Maximilian V of Bavaria, Johann Georg of Saxony; the northern monarchs -- Christian IV of Denmark and Gustavus Adophus of Sweden (and his daughter Christina and prime minister, Oxenstierna); the \"spoiler\", Cardinal Richelieu; the new Emperor Ferdinand III and his cousin, the warlord Cardinal-Infant Ferdinand of Spain; and many others. This book is written in a traditional English historian's prose style that is clear, eloquent and totally lacking the jargon of concurrent and later social and economic histories, while still covering these aspects of the period. In spite of some reviewers' claims of a \"Protestant bias\" in her interpretation, the author seems extremely fair when assessing responsibility for the long-running disaster of the war, taking the position that it was the self-serving political interests of the participants (dynasties, rulers, generals and paymasters) that kept the war going at the expense of the social and economic welfare of the vast majority of inhabitants of Germany and Bohemia.Although I am not familiar with this new edition (and Grafton's introduction) I emphasize that any reissuing of this book should have a brief scholarly introduction which supplies more details on the constitutional arrangements and crises of the Holy Roman Empire during the sixteenth century, with a special emphasis on the composition of the Bohemian estates and the conflicts between the estates and the Habsburg king-emperors. The extent and internal organization of \"the Bohemian crown lands\" should also be outlined. A succinct review of the political status of Lutheranism, Calvinism, the Bohemian Brethren, and other Protestant confessions throughout all of Europe around the year 1600 and a note on how their status had altered by 1700 would also be useful in \"setting the stage\" for the events of 1618 and understanding the relgious-denomination consequences of the war.The author supplies sufficient details on the major battles, but this is not a work of military history. As Wedgwood knows, battles were only significant in the larger view as a result of their political consequences. And it is in the elucidation of the underlying politics of the war (including how political prospects shifted with the waxing and waning of military fortunes) that Wedgwood excels. In her analysis of the general European situation at the outset of the war she proposes that there were three sets of forces which underlay and drove contemporary events. Each was a source of conflict and each might cross-cut the others, complicating the declared interests and objectives of the dynasties and nations involved. In brief, the forces were: (a) Religion, with three major competing factions (Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist; she notes that the conflict between the latter two forms of Protestantism was often as extreme as it was between each of them and the Roman Catholic Church). (b) Nationalism (French, German, Czech, etc.), which was a new force on the scene, crystallizing the idea that political entities might be defined by nationality (which here equals some combination of ethnicity and native language) rather than conceived of as polyglot territorial agglomerations brought about by dynastic interests. (c) Monarchic-constitutional issues, which were especially complicated and ambiguous within the \"constitutional\" grouping of major and minor powers known as The Holy Roman Empire (HRE).The constitutional problem was twofold. Within the small arenas of developing nation states and the yet smaller ones of traditional rulerships throughout Europe (duchies, counties, \"free-city\" areas ruled by town councils and mayors) contests over the basis and extent of the rulers' powers and privileges were taking place. Aristocrats, oligarchs and merchants had traditional corporate bodies (estates) reluctant to cede their own powers (taxation, the organization of military service) to a central authority. The same conflict was also being played out on the larger scale of the Hly Roman Epire, that loose grouping of special obligations and exemptions which was the final residue of an earlier system of vassalage binding together the elected Emperor (who had been a Habsburg for several centuries) and the smaller rulerships of Central Europe. The religious reforms, rebellions and wars of the sixteenth century had produced a system that appeared to resolve some of the potential problems through the won privilege of cujus regio, eius religio (\"whoever rules, his religion [is the religion of the ruled area]\"). In the year of the war's inception, 1618, this new balance was very fragile, comprising four Catholic and three Protestant imperial Electors. In Germany the special arrangements regulating relationships between the Emperor (resident in Vienna or Prague) and local rulers and guaranteeing a great deal of political autonomy to the locals, especially the Protestant Electors, had been somewhat codified by the Augsburg Treaty of 1555, and were known as the \"German Liberties\". These would prove to be especially important to the three Protestant Electors at the outset of the war.In the developing continental war one could be pro- or anti-Habsburg based on any one of the above factors or any combination of two or three of them. For example, a Catholic ruler (including the papacy) might seek Protestant allies in order to combat Habsburg territorial expansion in his direction or to combat constitutional changes in the Empire which affected his position adversely. Or a Protestant power might accept the Habsburg \"program\" in any given case because it did not wish to disturb constitutional arrangements that were to its advantage (this characterization is apt for Saxony and Brandenburg during the first twelve years of the war.)As Wedgwood notes, all three considerations (religion, nationality, constitutional relations) could be and were used cynically to advance the positions and interests of individual rulers and factions. From the point of view of rationality or predictability, political choices and commitments were often self-contradictory (e.g., a Catholic power supporting a Protestant venture; a German Liberties party accepting occupation by the army of a foreign power, etc.) or temporary expedients that made the overall European situation more chaotic. The war began locally in Bohemia, but its complications and consequences radiated outward as far west as Spain and England (even farther, to the Caribbean naval theater), as far north as Sweden and northeast to Poland, as far south as Italy and southeast as Transylvania; in other words, it was a European continental war with global impact.When the war broke out in 1618 it was over the Habsburg violation of a \"constitutional guarantee\" of religious freedom in Bohemia (the concessions stated in Rudolf II's Letter of Majesty). And here is where individual personalities and beliefs played an important role. Ferdinand II, who had knowingly violated the terms of the Letter soon after being selected by the Bohemian Diet as King (and therefore the first in precedence of the HRE Electors) was determined not only to expand the political powers of the Habsburg dynasty in Bohemia and elsewhere, he was firmly committed to the goals of the Catholic Counter-Reformation (i.e., re-Catholicizing all of the areas within the HRE which had become Protestant during the last one hundred years). When he was deposed by a special convention of the Bohemian estates (the defenestration of his deputies in Prague being the signal event of this deposition), the crown of Bohemia was offered to the Elector of the (Rhineland) Palatinate, Frederick V, who considered himself a champion of the Protestant cause. The religious zeal of these two antagonists led to extreme fixed positions at the very outset of the war.Given the other major conflict hovering in the background -- the Spanish Habsburg determination to recover the now Protestant area of the Netherlands which had become the successful and defiant (Dutch) United Provinces - the war soon became international. While the entry of France and then Denmark followed by Sweden, into the war during the 1620's changed its nature and extended its duration, Wedgwood concentrates much of her analysis on the behavior of the two Protestant Electors, Johann Georg of Saxony and Georg Wilhelm of Brandenburg and one Catholic ruler, Maximilian of Bavaria. It is her contention throughout the book that Johann Georg and Maximilian in particular could have prevented the war's spread and forced Ferdinand into a compromise very early in the course of events that acquired their own dynamism once they got out of hand. Despite their religious differences these two were always strong \"German Liberties\" proponents, and each had the same view of the Austrian Habsburg rulers: they should be kept for the broader protections they offered, but kept in place with respect to encroachments on the traditional rights of local rulers. In the end both of these rulers survived the lengthy war in spite of numerous diplomatic and military reversals (Saxony switched sides and joined the Swedes for several years, while Maximilian's position was constantly and secretly supported by his nominal enemies, the French, as their potential foot in the Habsburg camp.) Wedgwood believes that the price of their survival was far too costly for the rest of Germany.Wedgwood's gloss on the changing nature of the conflict is that by the year 1635 the war had become one of great-power politics, and that the earlier religious and ideological causes were losing their ability to motivate the antagonists. Her summary of the changes emphasizes the following:(a) Religion had discredited itself as a plausible source of political programs and a legitimate cause for war. Religion was becoming more interiorized and private, and losing ground philosophically and ethically to the new prestige of empirical and applied science (this was the era of Galileo and Kepler, with Descartes, Harvey, Hook, Newton, Huygens, etc. on the near horizon; a time of laboratory science and scientific societies.) As the basis of a political program religion was viewed cynically by those who saw the devastation it had brought about.(b) For thinking men, nationalism began to fill the emotional void in public life left by the withdrawal of religion as the underlying motive for political and cultural action. This was very obvious in France, but even true of Ferdinand III, for whom the new main cause was the construction of an Austrian-based hereditary monarchy whose additional obligations as the Holy Roman Imperial protector of far-flung German Catholics were no longer perceived as worthwhile. In the minds of both Germans and Austrian Habsburgs the Holy Roman Empire was becoming an honorific entity with ambiguous and weak political commitments in Germany. The Elbe-North German-Pomeranian ideal empire of Wallenstein was never again revived as a dynastic program. Austria began to move south and east (toward Italy, Croatia, and Hungary) in its expansionist aims.(c) The control of immense polyglot, multi-religious, mercenary armies and their huge camp followings had become a pressing matter of concern for all of the political authorities that hired them - they were neither religious nor national in their motives and aims and were in fact independent \"mobile states\" unto themselves, cynical and rapacious and often as dangerous to their paymasters as to their foes; whenever their immediate prospects for pay and maintenance looked bad, they changed sides. The most successful mercenary generals had become mini-sovereigns. Officers were all \"out for themselves\" and for their troops (rather than for the cause or nation of their paymaster), since without troop loyalty they had no means of personal advancement -- the most famous commanders, Ernst von Mansfeld, Wallenstein, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the Swedish general Wrangel, all expected (and some received) grants of territory and titles of nobility as their rewards for service. The \"national\" armies of conscripts that came to the fore in the 18th century was the answer to this problem.The pace of the war wound down during its last five years (although there were several major battles fought even then), which was a period of extended negotiatons in M&uuml;nster and Osnabr&uuml;ck, with the \"final treaty\" being signed late in 1648. For the next five years a series of conferences met at N&uuml;rnberg to implement and enforce the peace treaty and to deal with difficult problems raised by demobilizing huge armies. Many of the loans of this period, which were raised to cover the demobilization costs, were not paid off for a century. Individual rulers such as Charles of Lorraine and the Duke of Savoy (who got nothing from the treaty) refused to vacate various fortresses for five or six years, but the war did not break out again. France and Spain continued at war with each other, but not in Germany. Numerous soldiers, especially officers, went into mercenary service all over Europe. Others took to the hills as professional bandits - for the next 20 years merchants traveled through certain parts of Germany and Bohemia in armed caravans.Wedgwood accepts the more recent (1900-1930's) historical estimate that the population of the Imperial German lands (excluding Alsace and the Netherlands) dropped from about 21 million in 1618 to 13 million in 1648. The number of dislocated people was also substantial. While she acknowledges that the number of towns and villages destroyed and other \"infrastructural\" and economic losses were very large, she feels that all contemporary sources (e.g., the pamphlet literature of the next 100 years) exaggerated local losses, since all parties in the war continued to seek indemnities and restitution. The free peasantry benefited briefly, since landowners were desperate for manpower to restore their estates - prices fell while wages rose for a number of years, which increased the standard of living of peasants and artisans. But within a decade of the peace treaty the landowning gentry was pleading with Imperial, royal and local rulers to impose legal restrictions which would re-create bonded, serf-like conditions for peasants. Town councils now became pawns and bureaucrats of the dynastic courts of their rulers and also implemented restrictive legislations on peasants (e.g., prohibitions against mobility, domestic industry, and household craft production -- a trend which later historians refer to as \"neo-serfdom\"). Class stratification was as rigid as it was before the war started. There was a new, large class of mobile petty nobles and gentry seeking court-backed military and bureaucratic appointments, at the expense of town and peasant taxpayers.Germany and the Austrian-based monarchy and empire were totally excluded from the international competition to establish overseas colonies and from the developing \"Atlantic trade\". For a number of years the outlets of Germany's major rivers (Rhine, Elbe, Oder, and for Brandenburg-Prussia, Vistula) were controlled by foreign powers, reducing Germany's commercial strength. Hamburg was the exception, becoming the major maritime merchant city of the North Sea coast, at the expense of the other Hanseatic cities and the Scandinavian powers. The only medium-sized German state to emerge with positive prospects was Brandenburg, soon to become the administratively efficient and militarily powerful Prussia. The peace, while ending the \"wars of religion\", set the stage for a long series of \"nationalistic\" wars that subsumed dynastic and religious sources of conflict. France replaced the Habsburg Spanish-Austrian coalition as the menacing and tyrannical continental power willing to disturb the peace. Austria turned to the south and east and Spain lost its great power status and became an economic and cultural backwater. There was no politically or culturally unified Germany within the boundaries of the old Empire (French culture began to reign supreme) and the cosmopolitanism (its openness to outside influences) of this area during the 18th century, instead of being a source of pride over its achievements, became a source of lament for later cultural and ethnic purists of revived German nationalism.Author's Judgment and Conclusions: In terms of responsibility for the overall disaster, Wedgwood points to the futility and self-destructiveness of sincere religious zeal in the cases of Ferdinand II and the Elector Palatine. But, from the point of view of failures of practical (and ethical) politics, she highlights the behavior of Maximilian and Johann Georg, who could have prevented the spread of the conflict in 1620 and could have brought the war to an early end in 1635 if they had agreed to work together on a \"unified German program\" which would have forced Imperial compromises and concessions had they both stood behind it. Between these two she sees the Saxon as the greater victim of military circumstances (pressed by the Swedish juggernaut) and therefore less culpable for the mess, while she judges the Bavarian as too subtle and too ambitious in pursuit of his own dynastic and territorial ambitions at the expense of a general settlement good for his fellow Germans, thus identifying him as the more culpable.Beautiful in its style and concision, Wedgwood's final summary is also gloomy (as one might expect of a work completed in 1939, on the verge of World War II):\"As there was no compulsion towards a conflict which, in despite of the apparent bitterness of the parties, took so long to engage and needed so much assiduous blowing to fan the flame, so no right was vindicated by its ragged end. The war solved no problem. Its effects, both immediate and indirect, were either negative or disastrous. Morally subversive, economically destructive, socially degrading, confused in its causes, devious in its course, futile in its result, it is the outstanding example in European history of meaningless conflict.\"",

                "review/text": "Mr. Marshall has written an excellent overview of WWI - an overview is all this book is, though. It is important to keep in mind that any book, which attempts to examine one of the most complex conflicts in human history on less than 500 pages, will have to be brief. Consequently, the book is best used as a study, which offers a sense of structure of the events between 1914 and 1918. As a source of information on particular events, may they be political or military, the book is incomplete.Mr. Marshall's study is a valuable source for establishing a broad sense of the sequence of events. The interlocking of state policies is described with captivating simplicity. The first chapter, which examines the political climate of Europe leading up to the war, manages to present a convincing, if simplistic, narrative about the forces, which chose the path of armed confrontation over diplomacy and negotiation. Subsequent chapters chart the different stages of the conflict, spanning from 1914 to 1918 and shifting between the hills of Verdun and the peaks of Kilimanjaro. The different campaigns are described schematically and their most important themes and considerations are highlighted at the expense of more obscure factors. Given the complexity of the war, Mr. Marshall's ability to impose structure on the events is a rather praiseworthy achievement.Another commendable quality of Mr. Marshall's work is his literary style. Unlike many historical studies, this book is actually very readable. The author has an excellent sense of rhythm and a pleasant ratio of seriousness and irony. A favorite passage dealing with the early stages of the trench war describes how the shell shortage forced the British to \"...mark time on the Aisne while Germans fortified. The French followed suit so that they might live longer, and the novelty, while offensive to their doctrine, swiftly became a habit\" (page 127)If I have anything critical to say about this book, it will be about the analysis of the conflict as a series of chess moves. Mr. Marshall traces most events back to the intentions of a single individual (may these intentions be correct or erroneous). This desire to rationalize the development of the war in terms of the influence of the individual political and military figures does not capture the chaotic atmosphere of the period.In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that Mr. Marshall has compiled an overview of WWI, which affords an excellent structure of the conflict. If you want to understand the basics of this crucial point in world history, this compendium is for you. If you are looking for an in-depth analysis, it probably will not carry the title \"World War I\" but something more like \"The First Marne\". As Charles Jenks once wrote: \"You cannot blame a donkey for being a bad sort of horse.\"",

Marshall's concise, flavorful, and skilled accounting of the happenings of supposed War to End all Wars actually is. For a career soldier, the general penned an unexpectedly engaging work filled with highly original metaphors and colorful prose. This is human conflict at its very worst, and the errors committed both politically and militarily will manage to astound the previously uninformed. The lack of concern on the parts of Joffre, Falkenhayn, and Haig for their men is absolutely indecent. It tells us so much about how mindless acts of masochism like the planned battles of Verdun and the Somme in fact were--by comparison, the great majority of the general staff decisions of the Second World War appear logically consistent. This brings me to my oft repeated point that the best history is that which is indistinguishable from psychology in its conveyance of personality along with cause and effect. When juxtaposed alongside their nation's elite, Petain and Lloyd George are paragons of mental health as they are able to easily recognize the reality before their faces. If only everyone else did the same then maybe the slaughter could have ended in 1916. Alas!",

                "review/text": "S. L. A. Marshall wrote more than thirty books on military history and warfare during his life-time; \"World War I\" may be one of his best books on \"the war to end all wars.\" Marshall writes with authority and clarity, his research is well documented, and his writing is objective.Marshall begins by describing how one terrible event: the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand, on 28 June 1914, set off a chain of events that engulfed the world in a war of attrition. But Marshall goes further into that event by exploring the possible underlying causes of World War I.\"World War I\" covers military and political leaders, the economics of running a war, military strategy, weaponry, and even war manufacturing plants and their importance in waging war. Marshall clearly depicts what awaited the soldiers of the Entente and Central Powers, the lethal ground bombing, the introduction of poison gas, the relatively new and deadly machine-gun, tanks, and all the diseases that were part of trench warfare. Marshall writes that \"after only five months of fighting, there were more than one and a half million dead, wounded, or captured on both sides\". The author also covers military campaigns from the disastrous British attack at the Somme to the monumental French defense at Verdun.The book clearly describes the horrors of war; the carnage of human life which Marshall attributed to reckless actions and irrational thinking by military leaders on both sides. Marshall gives readers some important background on some of the heroes and villains of the war; he looks at the personalities of such Entente leaders as Georges Clemenceau, Ferdinand Foch, Lloyd George, Douglas Haig, \"Black Jack\" Pershing, and Woodrow Wilson. Next, he tackles leaders of the Central Power; among them, Conrad von H&ouml;tzendorf, Erich von Falkenhayn, Paul von Hindenburg, and Wilhelm Ludendorff. Marshall describes Germany's effort to recruit Mexico as their ally against the United States with the infamous Zimmermann Telegram. The author takes a brief look at Alvin York, the American soldier who fought bravely in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in France.A great deal of Marshall's books focuses on the war in Europe and rightfully so, since the United States did not enter the war until April 1917, but as with the European campaigns, Marshall writes objectively of America's political and military participation including their successes and failures. Marshall dedicates his final chapters to the surrender of the Central Powers - especially Germany, even covering a disgruntled Corporal from the German army by the name of Adolf Hitler. Marshall again speaks objectively about the Treaty of Versailles whereby he covers both the winners and losers during the peace process. Marshall explores the idea that it was the Treaty of Versailles that truly laid the groundwork that led to World War II.S. L. A. Marshall's \"World War I\" is a notable accomplishment and account of the First World War and should be considered a must-read book for first time readers of World War I.",

                "review/text": "\"Fitzpatrick's War,\" the first novel by Theodore Judson, bodes well for a stellar career in the field of writing and literary commendation. However, as engrossing as the tale is-with regards to that, please see either the book jacket or the description listed by Amazon-, I can't give it the highest possible ranking.To that point, and with that in mind, here are the highs and lows (at least from my perspective):Some Highs:* Perfectly detailed and on-tap nuevo-Edwardian perspective by the protagonist (Bruce)* Amazingly humorous 'footnotes' throughout the book* Vivid portrayal of Bruce of Charlotte* Solid and realistic, but too infrequent, character dialogueSome Lows:* Numerous points throughout the book had multi-page long paragraphs. At least in my case, I found myself \"parsing\" where the paragraphs could've either been abridged or terminated (and followed by another).* Overly long buildup to the actual war (in comparison to time spent on the war and thereafter)* (While only 1 chapter, oxymoronically,) The hideously long and overly precise (77 charges anyone?) detailing of the War* Unnecessary interlude of the Universal Railroad chapter* 'The events of Chapter 19'Make no bones about it, this is a good, original story. It has spot on caricatures not against, imho, conservatism (as railed against in other reviews here on amazon) but, rather, the general costs of war and decadence that success in war often brings to societies; greed of/for power/money and the irony of off-shoring (or undercutting).Of all these, however, the most prevalent theme is the importance of love of family-- both immediate and extended.That theme can not be told enough.",

This book is outstanding.The book is presented as the memoir of Sir Robert Mayfair Bruce, a soldier and engineer from the 25th century. Due to the \"Storm Times\" of the late 21st century, humanity has been forced back to the age of steam. The most powerful nation on earth is the Yukon Confederacy, which comprises the former United States, Canada, Great Britain, and Australia. In his college days, Bruce befriended an ambitious young man named Isaac Prophet Fitzpatrick, son of the Confederacy's then ruler. An unfortunate \"accident\" befalls Fitzpatrick's father and the son is made Consul. Fitzpatrick entrusts Bruce with engineering projects that prove most useful in the war he starts.Judson goes one step further with something that may be unique: Bruce's memoirs have been annotated by a college professor writing in the 26th century, Dr. Roland Modesty Van Buren. In that time, Fitzpatrick is thought of as a hero and Van Buren tries to discredit and refute many of Bruce's assertions in the footnotes. By clever use of these two diametrically opposed narrators, Judson makes critiques of everything from the concept of the history books being written by the winners, to religion, and to ambitious men who want to be Great Men.I strongly recommend this book.",

This is the story of a post apocalyptic world that has not changed that much, after a few centuries to rebuild, the world moves on as before but with no electricity. We first meet the story's main character, Robert, a boy from a small village that has distiguished himself in a border war with Mexico and won appointment to the military academy; as he first meets Fitzgerald...the current consul's son and the future consul that will conquer the world. The characters are well fleshed out and the overall world story is explained in small bits throughout the book. The author's comic prodding of academic credulity and hidebound traditions is a wonderful counterpoint -- these asides are related as historian's footnotes on nearly every page.

                "review/text": "\"Fitzpatrick's War\" commences in the year 2415 in a North America ruled by a dour, quasi-Victorian, \"United Yukon Confederacy\" . Several centuries of destructive wars and various social upheavals have resulted in the formation of a globe ruled in the western hemisphere by the Confederacy, and in the eastern hemisphere, by the Turks and the Chinese. Electricity-based technology has been replaced by that of steam, and the skies are filled with zeppelins and propeller-driven planes that operate with boiler engines. The Confederacy is managed by a nobility referred to as the Lords, while ambitious commoners can rise in class via outstanding service in the military branches. The Fitzpatrick of the title is one such Lord, with the goal of uniting the entire world under the Yukon banner. The narrator is a comrade-in-arms named Robert Bruce, who plays a major role in serving Fitzpatrick's sanguinary desires to bring the benefits of Anglo-Saxon civilization and Protestantism to the Heathen Chinee, the Dusky Hindoo, and the Muslim Turk.In its setting and theme of a future earth under the thumb of a less than benevolent Rule Britannia, \"War\" is clearly derived from the classic alt-future novel \"The Warlord of the Air\" and its sequels, by the English SF writer Michael Moorcock. Like Oswald Bastable in \"Warlord\", Robert Bruce enters the service of his country as a rather nave and too-trusting young man, who gradually comes to the realization that the individual to whom he has pledged fealty is in fact a megalomaniac, who will bring death and misery to those under his rule. The depiction of a future earth governed by the social and political mores of a Victorian revival echoes that of Moorcock's novels, with the addition of some bits of wry humor regarding social customs (for example, in the Yukon Confederacy, dancing is considered an obscene act).At more than 480 pages \"Fitzpatrick's War\" is a lengthy read and this is its strength and its weakness. The War of the title doesn't take place until more than 300 pages into the narrative, which means that the majority of the book is a leisurely exposition on the world of the Yukons and the various political intrigues that lead to Fitzpatrick's ascendancy as the Ruler of the World. Readers who enjoy this aspect of their alternate history novels may find \"War\" attractive in this regard. However, if \"War\" was meant by author Theodore Judson to be an adventure novel, the meandering plot fails to generate much excitement and the book suffers in comparison to \"The Warlord of the Air\". As a psychological drama of one man's rise, corruption, and fall, it also putters along at too slow a pace, and fails to generate any real sense of drama. One finishes the book liking Bruce, but also thinking of him as a bit of a dullard.In summary, readers of the seemingly endless series of alternate history novels churned out by Harry Turtledove may want to give \"Fitzpatrick's War\" a look, as well as those who enjoyed Harry Harrison's \"Stars and Stripes Forever\" series.",

Bruce is an interesting and realistic character because of his contradictions; he both loves and is faithful to his country (which is a monoculture explained further in a bit) and he is ashamed of the \"heroic past\" of that culture and its contemporary actions.We are given the background in a scene describing an oral examination Bruce is part of at the \"War College.\" America was a decadent nation in rapid decline in the mid-21st century. The \"Yukons\" were white supremacist farmers(this term is not used in the book, nonetheless, that is what they were from Judson's description of them and their ancestors retain their racism) who sweep in as America finally crumbles after years of misrule (by street and motorcycle gangs) and exterminate all the non-whites and exile the remaining \"Americans\" to ghettoes in Mexico. The culture they develop is a late Victorian/Edwardian mix. The Yukon Confederacy eventually encompasses the entirety of the \"Anglosphere\" (North America, Great Britain, and Australia) in a system that is a cross between feudalism and the Roman Republic (the Yukons only seem to study the \"Classics\" and the Bible), mixed with fervent religious fundamentalism. Some of the holidays the Yukons celebrate include the anniversary of the early Yukons massacring Congress and other similar events. Also, we are told \"cappucino\" is the Yukon slang for beating someone to death, after an early Yukon diner owner somewhere in the American west told two urbanites \"I'll give you a cappucino\" and took them outside and beat them to death. There are a number of these \"Turner Diaries\" moments throughout the book to remind us who these people are.Robert Bruce is a paradox, as are a number of the other characters, precisely because they are good people in an evil society. Bruce himself candidly admits to feeling shame over the early Yukons genocidal actions, as well as his own actions, but repeatedly displays prejudice against any culture other than the Yukons and also frequently makes remarks assuring us that he believes the Yukon people to be superior. While part of me felt that the Yukon culture should be erased for its crimes, a bigger part wanted Bruce and the other decent people in the book to survive in peace. We are assured, from the introduction by the pompous future editor, that Bruce's account is a \"false account\" of the history of Fitzgerald and his conquest of the world in opposition to the \"truthful\" and sanctioned accounts (dictated by Fitzgerald to a \"historian\" named Gerald, frequently cited in the footnotes). In other words, the winners wrote history, and Bruce wasn't one of the winners.The science is a little shaky. Part of the Yukon's ascendance is due to their mastery of steam technology and control of the \"Storm Machines\" that render electricity useless. Hmmm. It makes for a nice backdrop to the twisted \"belle &eacute;poque\" feel of the book though, so I didn't lose a lot of sleep over that aspect.Overall, a very entertaining and thought provoking book; as one reviewer mentioned, it is very timely in our current anti-intellectual climate. At the same time, I was continually nagged by the knowledge that the actors in this story were the descendants of the very people who are ruining America right now, the Bible-thumping Yahoos, but I figure books that end with \"And they all lived happily ever after\" are for kids, anyway.",

The Confederation of the Yukon, flying the flag of the Union Jack is the most powerful country in the world, assimilating Canada, the United States and Australia. It is a feudal age in which Lords and commoners have assigned roles in society and the history books laud Isaac Prophet Fitzpatrick, Consul and Supreme Commander as the heroic leader of his time.A book surfaces written by Sir Robert Mayfair Bruce, one of Fitzpatrick's closest and trusted friends, that the ruling elites do everything in their power to discredit. It paints Fitzpatrick as a megalomaniac who killed his own father in order to become the next consul; according to Sir Bruce, he declared war on China and Turkey, killing millions in his quest to rule the world; and his thirst for more power led those in his inner circle to turn against him. The Fitzpatrick portrayed in this book was no hero but a tyrant who craved, like his hero Alexander the Great, ruling the world.The victors rewrite history and it is up to the audience to choose whether to believe Sir Robert or the many history books that make Fitzpatrick out to be a heroic leader. One factor in Sir Robert's favor is that he doesn't spare himself in the narrative. He freely admits he took part in the genocide ordered by the consul and betrayed the vows he took as a soldier. Theodore Judson has created a thought provoking science fiction tale that will leave readers pondering what a fact is.Harriet Klausner",

                "review/text": "The War of 1812, seen through the eyes of Mr. Harry L. Coles, seems to be a war of lost victories, overblown ideas and swift retreats. The idea that the United States of America could win the war, in hindsight, seems down right sad. The US Navy had only 16 ships of any worth. The Army looked good, on paper, but in real life was mostly made up of ill-disciplined militia and untrained regulars who were directed, most of the time, by poor leaders and poor strategy. The government was not able to rise the funds or soldiers needed to carry out the large scale operations the military were dreaming of.But the British and Canadian side had their own problems also. The European military system just did NOT work well in North America. Also, like the Americans, they had problems with communication, transportation and the rising of, training of and equipping of the militia. The British Navy, in the opening stages of the war, found their reputation much tarnished by the American victories. And even with peace breaking out in Europe the British Empire still had to keep an eye on the French and the Russians.This book is a must for any American who wishes to understand how the nation, and government, changed in the early 19th Century. The only flaw, and this is my only issue with the work, is the lack of background for many of the major and minor players of this conflict. While many readers in the USA may know Oliver Perry, Andrew Jackson and Winfield Scott, I am ashamed to say I doubt many know who Henry Procter, Robert Ross or George Cockburn were. Mostly because they were on the other side of a conflict that we think of as a minor one.While the time line and the maps were pretty helpful I think more time spent on filling out the people and places of the conflict would have been a greater help.",

He reveals how the British and French duped Wilson into thinking the war was as good as won, and there would be no need to send an army overseas. He describes a harried president making speech after speech proclaiming America's ideals while supporting espionage and sedition acts that sent critics to federal prisons. And he gives a harrowing account of how the Allies did their utmost to turn the American Expeditionary Force into cannon fodder on the Western Front.Thoroughly researched and dramatically told, The Illusion of Victory offers compelling testimony to the power of a president's visionary ideals-as well as a starkly cautionary tale about the dangers of applying them in a war-maddened world.",

                "review/text": "This is a fascinating, entertaining, and truly eye-opening book. Like Thomas Fleming's earlerThe New Dealers' War: FDR and the War Within World War II, \"The Illusion of Victory\" is not only a great survey of events that shaped the modern world, but also a much-needed puncturing of one of the twentieth century's most over-inflated reputations (in the former case, FDR's, in this one Woodrow Wilson's) and a very timely reminder of how war overthrows all aims. Most of all, though, this is just extremely well-written history. It is definitely worth a read.Today, more than three-quarters of a century after the end of the first world war, the myths of that conflict, of America's place in it, and Woodrow Wilson's role in keeping us out, and getting us in, are more pervasive than ever. Fleming reveals not only what a failure Wilson truly was, but how the idealism for which he is so celebrated today was not only sacrificed on the altar of international politicking and hatred, but was poisoned even by the president's own messiah complex and uncompromising partisanship. Fleming paints Wilson as a truly unpleasant figure. And while I can imagine that many readers might consider this an overly negative portrayal -- and accuse Fleming of abandoning the serene and godlike objectivity so many historians maintain (or simulate) -- Fleming has the facts to back up his conclusions. The energy with which Thomas Fleming gores sacred cows like Wilson and FDR is one of his more distinctive characteristics, and it's one I, for my part, particularly value.As I said, there are many especially timely lessons contained in this book. One of the most striking concerns the remarkably vicious campaign against anti-war, or even insufficiently pro-war, elements in the United States, led by the government itself and its partisans. Whatever your opinions on the contemporary \"USA PATRIOT Act,\" you'll have to admit that John Ashcroft has not even remotely approached the reign of terror carried out in the U.S. during world war one in the name of \"100 percent Americanism.\" This discovery is just one of the many unsettling things readers may learn for the first time between these covers.Another concerns the equally vicious propaganda campaign against Germany, begun in the U.S. by the British and later enthusiastically adopted by the U.S. government. As other observers have argued, enciting hatred seems to be essential to carrying out the war aims of mass democracies. It's not enough to say we disagree with an opposing government's policies; the enemy -- citizens as well as governments -- have to be painted as subhuman, tarred with accusations of unimaginable atrocities, and condemned to nothing less than absolute, crushing defeat. Fleming does an excellent job showing how French, British, and even American leaders participated in the stirring-up of this blood-hatred of the Germans, and incited the American people to give in to it as well. The corollary of this, of course, is that such hatred can't turn on a dime, and it poisoned attempts to craft a peace treaty that solved legitimate grievances and created a new and better world. Fleming reveals, with sometimes painful clarity, how hatred fueled the creation of a Versailles Treaty designed to destroy Germany economically, militarily, and politically for generations to come. We all know the monsters that this created.On the whole, I find it hard to recommend this title *too* enthusiastically. I truly enjoyed the time I spent reading it, regretted having to put it down, and looked forward to when I'd be able to dive in again. It's hard to ask more from a book than that, and when a title is not only entertaining and educational, but challengingly \"revisionist\" and eye-opening too ... well, it doesn't get a whole lot better than that.",

That may seem an easy target, but Fleming has produced a book that is so unbalanced and filled with errors that he nevertheless manages to overshoot the mark.Let there be no mistake, Wilson deserves every ounce of opprobrium that has befallen him. His lack of realism in foreign policy has unleashed forces that still torment the modern world. His high-handedness toward Congress set a standard for political ineptitude that is almost unmatched in American history, and his indifference to the niceties of Constitutional law and civil rights would make even the the most populist \"law and order\" politician gasp at its brazenness.All of this Fleming discusses in almost excruciating detail. Yet, so lacking in balance is Fleming's approach, that he effectively calls into question his own thesis and leaves the reader wondering if this is not so much history as polemic. That is unfortunate, because America's conduct, both at home and abroad, before, during and after World War I is something that cries out for more exploration. Unfortunately, this book falls far short.The book is replete with factual errors that run from the trivial to the appalling. For example, Fleming refers to the British Army as the Royal Army. This is incorrect. While the British Navy and Air Force are officially referred to as \"Royal,\" the British Army, for historical reasons, is not. He discusses the post-war efforts by South Africa to acquire German West Africa, a colony he claims is present day Zimbabwe. This is wrong on several counts. German West Africa was actually called German South-West Africa, and it is the present day state of Namibia, not Zimbabwe, the latter of which, had Fleming consulted an atlas, he would have found in southeast Africa, not southwest. He refers to the then new state of Yugoslavia as a republic - it was a monarchy. He claims that Germany's first Kaiser was the father of Kaiser Wilhelm II. He was not, the first Kaiser was Wilhelm's grandfather.The list of errors is endless, and it calls into question Fleming's credentials as a historian. If Fleming cannot get these basic points right, then there is grounds for doubting the credibility of his wider conclusions about the war.More than the factual errors, however, are Fleming's wildly erratic moral judgments. British atrocities, such as the naval blockade of Germany, are outrages in the Fleming moral universe. Yet German atrocities are presented as being either grossly misstated propaganda or are simply not that bad. It seems not to occur to Fleming that one can deplore British actions without excusing German ones.Similarly, Woodrow Wilson stands accused of being both too moralistic and not moralistic enough. Fleming roundly criticizes Wilson for failing to uphold the Fourteen Points, but he portrays the idealism that inspired them as unrealistic utopianism. That latter argument is well justified, but it also sugests that accusations of hypocrisy are overstated. That Wilson was not being a hypocrite, but was haphazardly bending to forces he could not understand seems not to have occurred to Fleming.Also, like many so-called revisionist historians, Fleming is prone to apply moral judgments that would not have been operative to the subject of their study. Fleming berates Wilson for his racial views while neglecting the fact that such views were common in Wilson's time. This does not make those views valid, but it does suggest that Wilson was no worse than the American people he governed. Yet, in the next breath, Fleming castigates Wilson for not trusting the American people that Wilson claimed to believe in.Ironically, Fleming's view of Kaiser Wilhelm II is surprisingly indulgent. The Kaiser's racist pronouncements about the \"yellow peril\" are glossed over with barely a whisper of criticism, while his bellicose rhetoric, which helped so much to destabilize pre-war Europe, is completely ignored. This is bizarre, to say no more. While there can be no doubt that the Kaiser was not alone in starting World War I, it is passing strange to suggest that his statements about Germany's \"place in the sun\" and his erratic policies - such as the Morroccan Crises - played no part in the catastrophe of 1914.Finally, Fleming falls into the revisionist historian's occupational hazard of finding simple explanantions for complex problems. According to Fleming, American hostility to Germany was all born out of the British propaganda effort based in Wellington House. Had Germany had equal access to American media, Fleming seems to say, America might never have gone to war with the Central Powers.That America had extensive historical and economic ties with the Allies, that German unrestricted submarine warfare was seen by a maritime power like the United States as a particularly odious form of war, and that Germany's ham-handed efforts to ally with Mexico would have been viewed negatively by the country that espoused the Monroe Doctrine gains no credence with Fleming. He simply cannot believe that America's history and national interest played a part in shaping America's views of Germany. Instead, Wilson was biased and America was duped by British propaganda. This is silly and a gross oversimplification of history that demolishes Fleming's credibility.In the end, Illusion of Victory takes an unremarkable and broadly accepted view of Woodrow Wilson and attempts to give it a revisionist cast. This is unnecessary. Wilson's failings and lack of realism have long been part of the historical record and criticism of him is well justified. All Fleming has done with this lopsided and sloppy work is to demolish his own arguments by making them.",

                "review/text": "Mr. Fleming has admitted that he had to abandon the prejudices of a liberal New Jersey upbringing to arrive at an objective assessment of FDR (The New Dealers' War) and Wilson. He certainly has done that. Frequently he crosses over the line of purely objective historian into political and personal commentary, but his assessments all stand scrutiny. While \"Illusion\" contains some factual errors (note that Fiorello LaGuardia flew in Italy, not France) none are related to the major subject and none detract from Fleming's thesis: Woodrow Wilson's hypocrisy, arrogance, and hunger for power overcame his early idealism, leading to one of the greatest failures of any American administration. Fleming's description of the scheming and lies of Edith Galt Wilson and presidential doctor, Adm. Grayson, foretold comparable lies from FDR's naval aides in WW II. Mrs. Wilson emerges as the Shrew From Hell, reminiscent of the Clinton White House but without Hillary's softer, feminine side (!)Fleming details Wilson's failure in every major aspect: his refusal, after months of immobility, to hand over to his vice president; persistently ignoring vital domestic issues such as massive strikes and riots, a winter coal shortage, and persecution of minorities, to say nothing of the Prohibition debate. Wilson's tolerance for the continuing postwar naval blockade of Germany (\"the worst atrocity of the war\" says Fleming) led to thousands of deaths by starvation--this from the president who vowed to conduct \"a war without hate.\"Yet after all that, WW still felt he deserved a third term and declined to endorse his own son in law for the nomination.Well done--again--Tom Fleming.",

                "review/text": "At a time when many Americans are revisiting the wisdom of the current war in Iraq, The Illusion of Victory provides a cautionary tale. When the United States joined the English and French in their fight against Imperial Germany in 1917, an overwhelming majority of the populace thought this was the right and honorable course of action.Within a few years after the First World War ended, popular sentiment shifted dramatically and the majority of Americans believed that our participation in the European War was a mistake. Following Pearl Harbor and the Nazi declaration of war against the United States, the conventional wisdom shifted again and it was generally assumed that if fighting Hitler was right, going to war with the Kaiser must also have been correct.The Illusion of Victory re-examines the justification for America's declaration of war against Germany in 1917 and the negotiation of the Versailles Peace Treaty following the armistice. Thomas Fleming's highly critical assessment of American policy with regard to both the war and the peace treaty is hardly novel. Walter Millis expounded these views in the best seller The Road to War in 1935. However, Fleming's book is a very readable account of the American experience in World War I. He is dismissive of the reasons we went to war. Foremost was Germany's resort to unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 to prevent ships of neutral countries from reaching England and France. As Senators Robert La Follette, Sr., George Norris, and a few others pointed out at the time, the United States had acquiesced in the equally illegal British blockade of German ports since 1914.Fleming demonstrates utter contempt for President Woodrow Wilson, a figure whose conventionally good historical reputation is indeed difficult to understand. Wilson is most famous for his \"Fourteen Points\" speech and his crusade for American participation in the League of Nations. As Fleming points out, at Versailles in 1919, Wilson completely abandoned the Fourteen Points and agreed to British and French demands for a punitive peace.During the War, Wilson repeatedly stated that we had no quarrel with the German people, only with their government. At Versailles, Wilson and the Allies forced the Kaiser's successors to pay reparations, acknowledge sole responsibility for the outbreak of the war and yield territory and its colonial possessions to its neighbors. These measures were regarded to be illegitimate by Germans of every political persuasion and sowed the seeds for World War II. Wilson also acquiesced in the continuation of the British naval blockade of Germany, which starved its civilian population for months after the armistice and the abdication of the Kaiser.Fleming fails to fully acknowledge the domestic political pressures with which Woodrow Wilson had to contend. Beginning with the German sinking of the Lusitania in 1915, there was a very influential segment of American society passionately advocating war. The leader of this group was Theodore Roosevelt, the most notorious warmonger in this nation's history. The author appears to admire Roosevelt, who at least had the courage of his convictions. TR wanted to lead an American division to France and sent all four of his sons to fight. The youngest, Quentin Roosevelt, an aviator, was killed. Nevertheless, if Woodrow Wilson led the United States down the wrong path in going to war in 1917 and mishandled the Paris Peace Conference, Theodore Roosevelt and his allies bear as much responsibility for these errors as the President.Wilson, due to his unwillingness for compromise, bears much responsibility for America's rejection of the League of Nations. However, it is highly unlikely that even with the United States as a member, that the League would have sent an adequate number of soldiers to oppose Hitler's early moves to nullify the Treaty of Versailles. Since Hitler's criticisms of the Treaty contained some half-truths, Americans would have been no more willing than the French and the English to contest German rearmament in the 1930s, remilitarization of the Rhineland and the absorption of Austria.In The Illusion of Victory, Fleming is too easy on Imperial Germany, which was dominated by militarists, many of who believed war with France and Russia was inevitable and preferred it sooner than later. The harsh terms the Germans dictated to Russia at Brest-Litovsk in 1918 indicates that Germany would have been no more magnanimous than the Allies had they been victorious in the west. General Erich Ludendorff, who for all practical purposes ran Germany during the war, was only a slightly less despicable person than Hitler. As it turned out, had the Germans been more patient and not provoked the United States with submarine warfare, they most certainly would have defeated the French and British after the Russians collapsed. By bringing America into the War, the Kaiser's government clutched defeat out of the jaws of victory.Fleming covers the military aspects of American participation in World War I without much analysis. The biggest issue to arise was General John J. Pershing's insistence that American soldiers fight as an American army rather than as replacements in decimated French and British units. The Americans played a vital role in stopping the last German offensive and bringing about the German collapse when the Allies counterattacked. However, one wonders how history would judge General Pershing had the Germans broken through the Allied lines while he was resisting French and British pleas for reinforcements.The Illusion of Victory is an easily digestible introduction to a war whose unintended consequences plague us to this very day. While the Nazis and the Soviet Union no longer threaten us, we are at this very moment dealing with the fallout from the dismantling of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled Iraq for hundreds of years.The reviewer, Arthur J.

Fleming captures the times and sacrifices of the menand women serving ournation. He discribes aspects of this time period that many biographers of Wilson choose to ignore such as the imprisoment of Socialist Eugene Deba snd the supressing of civil liberties of dissenters.The book is a useful refence to anyone who wants to counter notions that our intervention was wise or desirable. It counters sterotypic portrayals of the British and French being the pillars of the stewards of democracy . It portrays Germany as a country caught up in circumstnaces with a more balanced portrayal of the Kaiser.However as provacative as these thoughts are I can not agree with all of Fleming 's conclusions. The end of the book tends to descend in an anti Wilson polemic including blaming Wilson for Prohibition and the rise of the American mafia! The facts were that Wilson vetoed the Volsted Act but one would never know that from Fleming's account.FDR is portrayed as a German hater(prelude to his anti FDR tome-New Dealers War?).Was this book written before that one? Teddy Roosevelt a Republican is accurately shown to be some what of a war monger but this leads to the question if Wilson was opposed to Teddy can not one argue that Wilson tried to keep us out of war. Fleming tends to ignore any evidence that puts Wislon in a more noble light. It even accuses the President wife and doctor of deceiving the American public on Wilson's stroke while ignoring the fact that 90 years ago it would have triggered a panic if the American people were told the nitty gritty of the President's condition. I gave the book five stars even with my disagreements because the book is well done even though many of its conclusions will be debated by historians for the next 100 years.",

Had Fleming been less diligent in annotation, I might agree with critics who found errors or disagreed with his analysis. However, I found it a stimulating read precisely because it presents an alternative point of view.As it's the first printing, one hopes the factual errors will be corrected for later editions, however, the value of the book is in seeing the period as the prelude to a century of wars rather than the war to end war.The wars within and without our borders evolved from this period. It was an ending and a beginning. Fleming makes his prejudices quite clear so that readers can take them for what they're worth. However, the book is very timely as we enter a new century defined, to date, by war.Questions of succession and globalization as well as questions of homeland security are defined in a new way by seeing how they played out almost a century ago.No one book should be considered the defining statement of such a tumultous time. But, I truly believe this work by Fleming is important to the dialogue.The very idea of a president not respecting his own advisers, being out of the country for months at a time, and allowing his wife to have more control over his office than elected and appointed officials should be anathema in any age.This is more than a discussion of Wilson and the war. It is an illustration of the politics of power and the reasons why our constitution defines things as it does. It also illustrates how the constitution can be sidestepped by egos over intellect.Whether one agrees with Fleming or not, this is a timely and necessary discussion.",

                "review/text": "It is astonishing that anyone could write something new and interesting about World War I after all of these years and all of the books already written about that sad, deadly, conflict. Thomas Fleming has written a book that is both new and interesting however like many of the recent crop of books about World War I it is more of an argument than a book of history. In that sense the book is well argued, but in the back of my mind as I read it, I wondered where the argument stopped and the facts began. A specialist will have to answer that. As it is, it is a well written, very interesting story of many of the military and political things that went wrong, and why they went wrong, before, during and after World War I.It is a wonder how Mr. Fleming could tolerate spending so much time with someone, Woodrow Wilson, that he obviously dislikes and does not respect either as a leader or as a person. The acceptance of the still troubling idea of a nation state for almost every little group that demands it can be traced directly to Woodrow Wilson. Few ideas have caused as much misery as the principle of a right of self determination for all peoples. Leaders as disparate as Ho Chi Minh and Eamon de Valera both heeded this call and used it to justify acts that Wilson would never have approved of, nor even thought possibly related to what he thought that he had proposed in one of his Fourteen Points. When you add in Fleming's bad opinions of Wilson's second wife Edith, England's Lloyd George and France's Georges Clemenceau, there are really a lot of people not to like in this book.One of the author's points is that it is important to understand how bad things can get when there is little or no objective information available for a democracy at war. How are the decision makers, the voters, to know what is the right thing to do if they are being force fed a constant torrent of lies. That the propaganda, particularly the British propaganda, during World War I took on a life of its own that still influences even supposedly objective histories of the war is another of the books points. According to the author there are many victories that little deserve that name and defeats that are still unknown. The case Fleming makes for each of these is persuasive, but it is not always history. You need to have some understanding of the history of World War I to fully appreciate the arguments that Fleming makes, but if you do this is a very good read. I will have to leave it to others to answer whether the book is good history, or just good argument.",

It also highlights the blatant and tragic trouncing of civil liberties in the Epionage Act (comparable to the Patriot Act), the moronic and blind hatred of anything German caused by propaganda from Wellington House and George Creel (comparable to French-bashing incited by the War in Iraq), the deception of the American public into thinking that the war was justified and that it would be easy & simple (many people, including some congressmen, didn't think that we would even send troops overseas).In the war, we ended up losing over 30,000 soldiers *in our own training camps* (prompted by lack of such simple equipment as blankets). 30,000 doughboys died on our side of the Atlantic--that out of about 120,000 casualties total, which includes 50,000+ killed in combat.The truth of the matter is that this isn't a book about America in World War I. It's a book about America in nearly all of our wars--the Mexican and Spanish Wars, the two Gulf Wars, Korea, and Vietnam.

The newly expanded The War of 1812: A Forgotten Conflict, Bicentennial Edition includes additional information on the British forces, American Indians, and military operations such as the importance of logistics and the use and capabilities of weaponry. Hickey explains how the war promoted American nationalism and manifest destiny, stimulated peacetime defense spending, and enhanced America's reputation abroad. He also shows that the war sparked bloody conflicts between pro-war Republican and anti-war Federalist neighbors, dealt a crippling blow to American Indians, and solidified the United States's antipathy toward the British.",

For such a short book, Hickey does a remarkable job with covering the political, military and (most welcome to me) social climates of the early 19th century. We learn all about the early U.S. economy and how important it was to have the good trade relationship with England and France that we initially had and how the subsequent naval conflicts with these countries affected that commerce. The other issues that led to the initiation of war, that were so complex, are covered clearly and concisely (no easy task...other books on this subject delve into much unnecessary detail that only cloud the issue leading to much confusion). All the important strategy (on the English and Native Indian side as well as the U.S. side)and battles are woven into a well balanced account. Additionally, the maps that are provided only add to that understanding. The stunning events of Fort McHenry, the burning of the White House and Andrew Jackson's battle of New Orleans are given their proper due along with lesser known conflicts along both Lakes Erie and Ontario. Finally, the political maneuvering on the part of the U.S. delegation at Ghent get a &quot;to-the-point&quot; summary that clearly lets the reader know what all the issues were that ended the war. Hickey is not bashful about stating that this war was, at best, a draw and that the U.S. &quot;won&quot; by not losing and that the diplomats at Ghent were ultimately responsible. Overall, I'm sure that the long version of this book went into much more detail on the battles and diplomacy, but, for a summary, you won't find many accounts better.",

In concise chapters, Hickey fills in the diplomatic and political background to the war, including the political divisions between the Republicans and the Federalists--and among the various factions of the Republicans; the military campaigns in the Northwest, Niagara, East, and Southwest, the naval encounters, the British attacks on Washington and Baltimore, and the triumph of Jackson at New Orleans;the \"inner war,\" especially the isolation of the Federalists and New England; and the Peace of Ghent and its ironic aftermath, as the Federalists were in large measure scorned even while their beliefs in the need for greater maritime security and internal taxation were vindicated. Along the way, Hickey highlights the frequent problems of supply, finance and morale (such as militiamen not wanting to cross the Canadian border in the middle of a campaign), the accomplishments of rising stars such as Winfield Scott, Oliver H. Perry, William Henry Harrison,and of course Francis Scott Key; the ineptitude of some American leaders (political and military); and the roles of various Indian tribes in the conflict. Although told more from the American point of view, the book also notes the political aspects of the war from the point of view of English leadership.Although I've studied plenty of history, I've never read much about the War of 1812, and this book filled the gap in a short time.

He dismisses the obvious, the merchant marine was the lifeblood of the young nation and the engine of prosperity. He ignores the personal - 6000 sailors impressed into British service. I try to imagine the sentiment of the nation during that era with so many of it's families impacted by that brutal British policy and the fate of the political party that supported the Jay Treaty. The Federalists were perceived as elitists who were more worried about their landed financial interests and less about the fate of the common man and the sovereignty of the nation. From that perception came the elitist label and the end of their party.In the Coming of War, Hickey all but calls the Republicans isolationists. In Conclusions, he accuses the Republicans of needless war mongering for political advantage. What he misses in between is a country who's sovereignty was under assault on multiple fronts. That Americans were not looking for a fight is obvious from the decade-long effort to stay out of the mess created by European elitists fighting endless wars. That some of the Federalists policies were in many respects better is obvious, but their demise is easy to understand.Getting this country to fight at all was a miracle brought about only after great effort and miscalculations on the part of Great Britain.Great Britain judged Americans wrongly: They didn't see a cohesive nation after they witnessed the easy flipping of coastal towns and assumed all Americans were so weakly bonded together. This was not the Second Revolutionary War or the Unnecessary War, it was the finishing battles of the first.Hickey calls the result of the war a failure of Republican policies. The real point is that the beginning of the war was a repudiation of the financially-centered policies of the Federalists. These policies, while convenient to a weak nation seeking economic growth, sacrificed national sovereignty - a position that can not be tolerated forever. That the all-powerful Federalists could disappear so early in the nations history is simple repudiation enough. That Hickey ignores the obvious for tortured logic is lazy scholarship. One can not help feel that he wrote many of these conclusions in allegiance to modern American politics.",

                "review/text": "Victoria's Home CompanionThere are myriad cook books that claim to accurately represent the preparation of Victorian cuisine yet fall as flat as a souffl&eacute; on close inspection. There are also numerous tomes on life and culture in 19th Century America; however, no other book captures the breath of domestic life in the United States of the 1800's as fully as Victoria R. Rumble's marvelous Victoria's Home Companion. This work is a must for any student of cultural and domestic history and de rigueur for writers of historical fiction. It is the definitive work on American material culture and other treatises pale by comparison.Victoria's Home Companion was first brought to my attention when I was in the midst of researching a manuscript that is set in 19th Century Boston. I was in need for information on Victorian American cuisine, domestic customs and the kitchens of the period. I contacted a noted chef in Los Angeles who immediately steered me to Mrs. Rumble's website and thankfully, Victoria's Home Companion. I found the book to be full of colorful facts that were not confined simply to cooking. There were regional recipes, information on planting, a marvelous chapter on edible plants that were consumed in the 19th century, methods of preservation and preparation of meat and fish. Mrs. Rumble also gives a detailed list of canned foods that were available in the 19th century in addition to an authentic examination of American kitchens and what went on in them from the pre to post Civil War era. The book is also replete with descriptions of period cooking tools; for anyone interested in cultural history, the book is remarkably free of anachronisms.There are a plethora of recipes, all totally authentic and presented in their original format, before Fanny Farmer revolutionized the cookbook with her accurate measurements. A recipe for Pepper Pot illustrates the authenticity of the recipe. \"Stew gently in four quarts of water till reduced to three, three pounds of beef, half pound of lean ham, a bunch of dried thyme, two onions, two large potatoes, pared and sliced; then strain through a colander, and add a large fowl, cut into joints and skinned, half a pound of pickled pork, sliced the meat of one lobster, minced, and some small suet dumplings the size of a walnut. When the fowl is well boiled, add half a peck of spinach that has been boiled and rubbed through a colander, season with salt and cayenne.\"In addition to recipes, there are chapters on specific foods replete with historical information. The chapter on bread was filled with anecdotal information about the staff of life and the pages overflow with jewels of information gleaned from memoirs, journals, and letters. It was a joy during the Christmas holidays to sample some of the instructions for beverages including a festive gin-punch and an 1858 recipe for eggnog.Perhaps some of us view the \"good old days\" through the lens of rosy nostalgia but this marvelous work enlivens the past in a manner that illuminates and entertains.",

                "review/text": "The inaugural volume of the highly honored but still unfinished \"Oxford History Of The United States\" series is \"The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789,\" a superbly written, scholarly, and highly literate account of the America's War for Independence. Written by Robert L. Middlekauff, Professor of History... this is the finest account of the Revolutionary War I've found to date... even better than Benson Bobrick's \"Angel in the Whirlwind,\" which I've already reviewed.\"The Glorious Cause\" is a comprehensive account of the American Revolution designed to give readers a well rounded overview of not only the causes of the war, but also of how the war was fought. The book succeeds admirably at its task. After finishing \"The Glorious Cause,\" I felt a much greater appreciation for the men and women whose struggle for freedom brought forth on the North American continent a new and independent nation - the United States of America.\"The Glorious Cause\" begins by examining the causes of the American Revolution. In one of the book's earliest chapters, entitled \"The Children of the Twice Born,\" Middlekauff carefully lays out his closely reasoned and well argued thesis: that the seeds of revolution were planted long before the war was actually fought. Those seeds, embodied in the economic, social, political, and religious fabric of American society, made the evolution to democracy on the North American continent almost inevitable.The earliest settlers came to the New World because of their disenchantment with authoritarian English laws and what they viewed as centralized, overly ritualistic, dogmatic Anglican religion. When the settlers arrived with their ideals of political and congregationalist religious democracy, they found land cheap and plentiful. Whereas only about 20 percent of all Englishmen were landowners, and hence were eligible to participate in England's parliamentary democracy, over 50 percent of American colonists owned land and therefore could take part in colonial parliamentary government. The result: provincial representative assemblies tended to do the bidding of their constituents rather than the royal governors. After the Seven Years' War, tension between American political and economic interests and the interests of the British government was exacerbated by Parliament's intent to restore Britsh prerogatives in America.Tension was bound to lead to conflict, and that conflict wasn't long in coming. The American colonies were left pretty much to their own economic and political devices during the Seven Years' War, so long as they provided support for Britain's war against the French. The colonists bore the brunt of the fighting during the war against the French in North America; at war's end, they expected to be permitted to return to some semblance of self-government. It was not to be, however. Under Britain's new King and a Parliament with a new-found awareness of the American colonies' potential to enrich their colonial masters, Parliament began enacting a series of laws (Stamp Act, Townshend Acts, Sugar Act, etc.) designed to bring the colonies to heel. The colonists, thoroughly imbued with the ideals of democracy and liberty, rebelled, first through political means, and finally, inevitably, through violence.Once \"The Glorious Cause\" completes its assessment of the causes of the war, it takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the war itself. The way the American Revolution was fought is frequently shrouded in the mists of legend, with great American heroes standing tall against the overwhelming might of the British and Hessian armies. There are strong elements of historical truth to that legend, but Middlekauff does an excellent job of portraying the war exactly as it was: a very closely contested fight between colonial masters and those who wished to throw off the yoke of colonialism.There's really almost nothing to criticize in \"The Glorious Cause.\" It is, in nearly every respect, an outstanding work of history. It's comprehensive in its scope; thorough in its approach; obviously very well researched; and imbued with careful, thoughtful, and incisive historical analysis. Middlekauff's descriptions of Revolutionary War battles are first-rate. The author completely captures the flavor of eighteenth century warfare in general, and of the battles of the American Revolution in particular. When I finished reading \"The Glorious Cause,\" I felt as if I had actually been there at some of the great battles of the war.One very minor caveat: because \"The Glorious Cause\" takes a fairly academic approach to studying the American Revolution, the book's somewhat lofty and scholarly sounding language may not appeal to readers with only a passing interest in history in general, and the American Revolution in particular. That's not to say the book has only a narrow appeal to academics and history scholars, however; it is definitely written for the general reader with a love of American history. It will, in my view, prove a most satisfying experience for the vast majority of history lovers who decide to read it.\"The Glorious Cause\" is a winner of a book in every respect. With a dearth of excellent books about the American Revolution currently in print, this volume fills a crucial need for those who wish to learn about America's struggle for independence. As the inaugural volume of the \"Oxford History Of The United States,\" \"The Glorious Cause\" also sets the tone for the whole series... highly readable, thoroughly imbued with first-rate scholarship and a polished, eloquent writing style; and simply a pleasure to read.",

                "review/text": "Middlekauff has read deeply in the history of the American revolution and the early republic. Moreover, he is interested in more than just a simple narrative; he is interested in causes and motives, as he shows in chaps. 20 and 21 of this book, which discusses why soldiers fought instead of ran.Unfortunately, the narrative in this book has holes, and Middlekauff often fails to put people and personalities into context, making the reading less interesting than it should be. He also makes high demands on readers' attention; this, plus the holes, made the book heavy going at times.Here are some examples of holes: 1) In his discussion of the Intolerable Acts, Middlekauff fails to say what the Quebec Act was, yet on pp. 239 and 280 he assumes you know. 2) 471: \"They all knew what happened to Buford's men at Waxhaws when they tried to run away.\" This is the only time \"Buford\" and \"Waxhaws\" are mentioned in the book. 3) 340: \"June also brought William Howe back to New York.\" I can't find where it says Howe had been in New York before. 4) 462: \"Some hint of what was coming was given ...when the victors, shouting 'Tarleton's Quarter,' shot and stabbed the wounded...\" There is no explanation of this anywhere in the book. 478: \"... Lee's Legion rode in. Greene once more had his army in one piece.\" This is the first time that \"Lee's Legion\" is mentioned. I had to look in the index to find out that \"Lee\" was Henry Lee. It never explains how he got a legion. The last time we saw him, on 417, he was foraging in Delaware.No context for people and personalities: Isaac Barre gives a speech supporting the colonies in parliament (74-75), but Middlekauf never tells us who he is or why he speaks so strongly.Directly below, the American who thinks Barre's speech is \"noble\" is never identified. Apparently it was Jared Ingersoll, who appears in a very different light in other parts of the book.Demands on reader's attention: 406-7 \"Amherst told the king...\" This is Jeffrey Amherst. The last time we met him, also identified only as \"Amherst\", was page 276, where he was fighting Montcalm in Quebec for all of one sentence. Look up Amherst in the index, see where he appears, and see how easy it is to connect these references. This is very tough, demanding writing.Middlekauff knows the period, is a very intelligent writer, has interesting views and judgments which he backs up effectively. However, if you want to understand what is going on, you will have to go to other books in addition to this one, and you will have to pay very close attention to Middlekauff, with pencil in hand and constant reference to the index.As an example of a book which brings people and personalities strongly into context, I recommend Barbara Tuchman's \"March of Folly\" which has an outstanding chapter on \"The British Lose America.\" This will tell you who Barre was, why they were drinking toasts to John Wilkes in South Carolina in 1768, and what the Quebec Act was. It's only a tiny fragment of the history Middlekauff tries to cover, and occasionally falls down as well (Tuchman mangles the text of Barre's speech), but is a great example of fascinating historical writing which historians would do well to study.",

I was hoping for a great deal more in the political, social and economic areas than Profesor Middlekauff was able to deliver. If this well researched historical text were to be part of the Oxford MILITARY History of the United States one would be less surprised at the laborious details the author gets into on the various battlefields. I have previously read two voumes of the Oxford History of the United States: James McPhearson's \"Battle Cry of Freedom\" and David Kennedy's \"Freedom from Fear\" dealing with the Civil War and World War II, respectively. Both of these authors deliverd strongly where Middlekauff fell far short, namely away from strictly military matters. I would strongly urge those interested in military history to read this book. Those less interested should search out some other work with a broader analytical framework such as The Radicalism of the American Revolution where its author, Gordon Wood, addresses the political theory and thought that went into the Revolution.Oxford History of the United States - Update (March 2007)After a long silence there has been some news this terrific series, as reported in the Boston Globe (December 24, 2006).It appears as if readers are in for a treat over the next 12- 24 months with the \"missing\" volumes at least having manuscripts into David Kennedy (Freedom from Fear) and the series' new editor with the passing of C. Vann Woodward.Volumes 1 and 2, covering the Colonial Period (1672-1763) have been assigned, in some order, yet to be made public (that I am aware of) to Fred Anderson (University of Colorado) and Andrew Cayton (Miami University of Ohio).Volume 3 - The Glorious Cause 1763-89, Robert Middlekauf PUBLISHEDVolume 4 - The U.S. from 1789-1815, Gordon Wood (Brown University)Volume 5- What Hath God Wrought 1815-48, Daniel Walker Howe (UCLA)Volume 6- Battle Cry of Freedom, 1848-65, James McPherson PUBLISHEDVolume 7- Leviathan: America Comes of Age, 1865-1900, H.W.

What will take its place is not yet known. I would speculate that Brands will be writing on this same period, just not for this series as the work was largely done. A similar event happened some time ago with Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick writing \"The Age of Federalism, 1788-1800\". This was originally to be part of the series but the two apparently did not go far enough chromatically for the publishers. Also John Gaddis Lewis has written extensively and was also, somehow, dropped by Oxford. All of this makes for great reading one way or another.",

                "review/text": "The Glorious Cause is comprehensive and complete, extremely ambitious in its scope. It is painstakingly footnoted, documenting a wealth of sources of both primary and secondary research. It is a military history as well as a political history, and wanders into social commentary as well. Middlekauff does a masterful job of explaining how pivotal the French and Indian War was in American History as it forced England to re-examine her relationship to her American colonies. Prior to that war the colonies had not provided England with the wealth that imperial nations desire from their colonies, but they had not really cost her anything either. But that war caused England to realize that money would have to be spent to defend her stronghold in the New World if she intended to keep it. That looked to be an expensive proposition, making it necessary to find a way to make the colonies produce revenue to offset the expense. Attempts at taxation without representation, a fundamental right of Englishmen, caused colonists to examine their status as citizens of their mother country, leading them to decide that they were not Englishmen at all. Middlekauff also gives us a glimpse of heroes of the pre-revolutionary period and shows our &quot;patriots&quot; as radicals and &quot;revolutionaries,&quot; a far more accurate depiction of the men who were able to bring about so monumental a change in the course of history. It also shows the human side of the American army, and how Washington wrestled with the fact that many were unwilling to fight. Due to the length of the book and the abundance of detail, it can be tedious. Middlekauff does his readers no favor in trying to impress them with his personal observations such as: &quot;Soldiers of all nationalities usually have a special fondness for profanity, and many have a special proficiency in its use&quot; (p. 419). In a less lengthy book, such intimacy with the reader might be appreciated, but in a book of 665 pages, it is simply wasted words. Yet, upon reading the book with an eye toward shortening it, one realizes that not much could, or should, be left out. Just be prepared for the most thorough, complete, and detailed account of this period of American history that you will ever find in one book.",

                "review/text": "After hearing the Schoolhouse Rock favorite, \"The Shot Heard Round the World\" about 500 times on a trip recently (I have young kids), I just had to get a good book on the American Revolution. I chose this book, the first in the Oxford History of America Series, \"The Glorious Cause\" by Robert Middlekauff from several at my local bookstore (don't worry Amazon, I buy a lot of books from you, too). I chose it in large part because the publisher was Oxford, who generally puts out great books and series. Overall, the book did not disappoint, but it was not quite as good as the dust jacket led me to believe.First, the good: the language and flow is excellent. In the sense of just sitting back and reading - it's a good one. The vocabulary level is pretty high, but you won't need to reach for the dictionary often. The book seems incredibly-well researched. It was clear that Middlekauff is VERY well read on this subject and period, and the footnoting is well-done. I really like being able to follow up on the sources he used and he is generous and thorough in sharing them. Also, he spends a lot of time on the events leading up to the war. Although one reviewer feels that four chapters on the Stamp Act is too much, it actually almost wasn't enough for me! I say that because if you believe what Middlekauf first states (and seems to be true from other readings), that the American people had NO desire to secede from Britain early on, then you must wonder how they got so quickly (relatively speaking) to a course of action as radical as a fight for independence! So I believe the time spent on that period is critical and interesting. The details of the battles are excellent, and generally, any material he provides is thoughtful and interesting. Basically everything he chooses to write about is done well.One of the negatives, though, is that the book feels like so much is missing. I can appreciate the desire to keep the book from becoming 3,000 pages; however, there is something about its structure or style that makes it feel like he tried to cram 3 volumes into one - and didn't succeed very well. One chapter, for example, near the end of the book covers such diverse topics as the Tories, the Indians, Slaves and Slavery, American social classes, the Navy, etc., etc. The section on Indians is only two or three pages. I understand that you can only cover so much, but I think Middlekauf would have been better served by either narrowing his focus and writing a coherent narrative, or expanding the book.I admit to much ignorance of the subject, which has been somewhat repaired by reading this book, but there seemed to be some important items left out: there was nothing about Benedict Arnold's betrayal, virtually nothing about British popular reaction to the war, very little to explain French movements and personalities, and in general, the coverage of the last few years is scantier than the first. Upon reflection, I think the criticism here is related to the first - it simply reads as if the book is a collection of really great bits and pieces of the history of the revolution without a clear plan as to what was going to be covered in detail and what was going to be left out. One of the things that contributes to this is covered by another review in detail: Middlekauf's tendency to mention key figures without any introduction or even hint that they have never been mentioned before (you find yourself thinking, \"oh, I must have forgotten that paragraph that explained who this person is...\", but then you go back and realize - there is no such paragraph!).My single biggest complaint, though, is reserved for the editor - the typos!!! There were misspelled words, bad grammar, and other obvious typographical errors every three or four pages. It was really, really annoying and there is really no excuse for a publisher like Oxford to let something out in this state.If I appear to be more negative than positive, then the negative came off too strong (I wish I could give it 3.5 stars). It IS a good book. I enjoyed reading it and actually found it quite hard to put down. I just wanted it to be better. I think it fell short of its potential and didn't do justice to the writer's obvious command of the subject. Maybe I'll feel differently after reading other histories of the same period - this was my first. I still recommend it, though, despite the flaws, and would read other works by Middlekauf.",

(The text runs under 700 pages.) Yet as it shifts between those disciplines, Middlekauff adapts his vocabulary to the task. Descriptions of military actions employ the terms of the battlefield and I doubt that Stephen Ambrose or Max Hastings could bring the actions more to life than Middlekauff. Larger-than life men are described in human terms that also inspire. I felt perfectly confident with his expertise, whether describing the demographics of the colonies, the debates in the Continental Congress or the bloodshed on the battlefields.To get a flavor for Middlekauff's style, read the section on George Washington's early life, or von Steuben's role in training the army at Valley Forge.

In demythologizing the war as we saw it through grade-school eyes, author Robert Middlekauff profiles our Revolutionary forebears as they really were: men of courage and vision who were not without their flaws. Likewise, the British redcoats we loved to hate may not have been entirely hostile or unsympathetic to the legitimate grievances of the Americans, yet their often condescending view of the colonists and an incompetent colonial policy gave America no option but to rebel in the end. The book's well-written accounts of the Revolution's major battles will increase the reader's understanding of political, logistical, and strategic problems on both sides which contributed to the conflict's drawn-out, six-year duration. Unlike other histories of the war which end with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Mr. Middlekauff offers an absorbing narrative of the drafting of the Constitution in 1787 and its subsequent ratification by the states. After reading &quot;The Glorious Cause&quot;, I can better appreciate the sacrifices made over 200 years ago by a determined people who, in defending divinely-established rights and liberties for themselves and their posterity, defended virtue and morality as well.",

The middle part of the book was a bit unsatisfying and disjointed; he never, for example discusses Benedict Arnold's treason, and the surrender at Yorktown seemed almost anticlimatic. And those looking for a revisionist or even slightly ironic description of the main characters of the tale are going to be disappointed. Middlekauf gets back on form with the tale of how the Constitution came into being; he seems most comfortable dealing with drawing-room politics. All in all, not bad, but not the classic that others of the series have become.",

        "description": "In June 1812 the still-infant United States had the audacity to declare war on the British Empire. Fought between creaking sailing ships and armies often led by bumbling generals, the ensuing conflict featured a tit-for-tat \"You burned our capital, so we'll burn yours\" and a legendary battle unknowingly fought after the signing of a peace treaty. During the course of the war, the young American navy proved its mettle as the USS Constitution, \"Old Ironsides,\" sent two first-rate British frigates to the bottom, and a twenty-seven-year-old lieutenant named Oliver Hazard Perry hoisted a flag exhorting, \"Don't Give Up the Ship,\" and chased the British from Lake Erie. By 1814, however, the United States was no longer fighting for free trade, sailors' rights, and as much of Canada as it could grab, but for its very existence as a nation. With Washington in flames, only a valiant defense at Fort McHenry saved Baltimore from a similar fate. Here are the stories of commanding generals such as America's Henry \"Granny\" Dearborn, double-dealing James Wilkinson, and feisty Andrew Jackson, as well as Great Britain's gallant Sir Isaac Brock, overly cautious Sir George Prevost, and Rear Admiral George Cockburn, the man who put the torch to Washington. Here too are those inadvertently caught up in the war, from heroine farm wife Laura Secord, whom some call Canada's Paul Revere, to country doctor William Beanes, whose capture set the stage for Francis Scott Key to write \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" 1812: The War That Forged a Nation presents a sweeping narrative that emphasizes the struggle's importance to America's coming-of-age as a nation. Though frequently overlooked between the American Revolution and the Civil War, the War of 1812 did indeed span half a continent -- from Mackinac Island to New Orleans, and Lake Champlain to Horseshoe Bend -- and it paved the way for the conquest of the other half. During the War of 1812, the United States cast aside its cloak of colonial adolescence and -- with both humiliating and glorious moments -- found the fire that was to forge a nation.",

                "review/text": "1812: The War That Forged A Nation, by Walter R. Borneman, is a comprehensive, if somewhat superficial, look at the war that gave the United States a national identity, even as it ended in essentially a stalemate. Borneman is mostly known for history books dealing with the western United States, and he even mentions in his Acknowledgements how this book seems to be out of his field. However, Borneman maintains that the war set the United States on a course that would result in the western expansion that is his bread and butter, and thus deserves to be looked at more closely. It's a very interesting book that covers the entire war that tells everything that happened, though it doesn't quite go into as much detail as I would have liked.Borneman sets the stage for the war by discussing the relations between Great Britain and the United States in the first decade of the 1800s, including one of the main reasons for the United States to go to war: the impressments of American sailors into British naval service on the high seas. The United States was still considered an extremely minor power and was bullied by pretty much everybody. While the French didn't impress sailors, they did do other things, and some hawks in the American government actually advocated going to war with both Britain and France! One other reason for the war, not as popularly known, was that many westerners wanted to steal Canada out from under Great Britain while they were distracted by Napoleon on the continent. They didn't see any reason why Canada shouldn't be part of the United States, by force if necessary.Thus, the war drums were beaten, and war was declared. Borneman does a great job showing us all of the machinations that went on behind the scenes to get the declaration of war passed in Congress, along with a couple of incidents that almost got the war started before it really did. While this information is obviously well-known to history buffs who have studied the era, it was information that I hadn't known before and I liked how Borneman laid it all out for us. He shows how Madison went along with all of this, though he was almost hoping that Congress would bail him out of the course he had set for the country.Once the fighting starts, Borneman also explains all the battles that happened during the war, sometimes in very vivid detail. He tells us about the horribly executed three-pronged invasion of Canada that resulted in the loss of Detroit to the British, as well as the first major US victories on the high seas before the British finally started taking this upstart navy seriously. The level of detail is amazing sometimes, though for some reason I felt a bit removed from all of the action. I'm not sure if it's because he is sometimes unable to give reasons for what happened or if it's his style, but while the prose is detailed, I felt like something was missing. Perhaps it's because the book comes in two modes: detailed battle information and the reasons behind some of the events in the war, but these two modes never really mingle. Instead, we get some battle detail, then we get some \"big picture\" information, and then we go back to the battles, etc.I do have to give Borneman credit, however, for making a (for lack of a better word) \"boring\" war very interesting to read about. He has obviously done his research and he gives descriptions of tactics in each battle (including wonderfully rendered maps!). These descriptions make you feel like you are right there on the battlefield, hearing the explosions and feeling musket balls whistle past your ear. Sometimes his descriptions make it seem impossible that so few (relatively speaking, of course) men actually died in these battles. He describes men being mown down by rows of musket fire and then we hear casualties of 81 killed and 500 wounded or the like. Of note is his account of the Battle of New Orleans, a battle that was fought after the armistice had been signed but before news had reached the participants, and could have resulted in a resumption of hostilities if the British had won. This battle is even more lovingly described than the rest of them and he really shows Andrew Jackson's leadership and tactical expertise in this chapter.The War of 1812 was a war that some in the United States wanted for their own purposes, but one that almost to a man it was desperate to get out of as Napoleon surrenders and the British are able to concentrate on this annoying gnat of a country. Nothing was resolved officially, but it turns out to be the war that would cement the feeling of \"America\" on an infant country that was just trying to find its feet in the world. Borneman does a great job showing how this occurred, with Jackson's resounding victory of a battle-hardened British army being the final piece of the puzzle. While there may be more comprehensive books on the War of 1812 out there, 1812: The War that Forged a Nation is a wonderful starting point.David Roy",

                "review/text": "The War of 1812 is often passed over very quickly in American history class because it is supposedly neither very interesting nor important. Walter Borneman seems to have taken exception to this idea and has set about to show his readers just how interesting and important this war was. His writing style and his ability to guide the reader along through a maze of events and people in a clearly understandable way help him to accomplish his first goal. I think however, that he may have overreached on the importance of the war, at least when it comes to national unity.Borneman writes much like a novelist and his prose keeps the story of this conflict going in a quick paced and highly engaging manner. He is in fact, a little too conversational at times and although I did find this to be a little distracting it wasn't a big problem at all. The most amazing aspect of Mr. Borneman's writing style is that he manages to tie all of the action into the bigger picture with what appears to be very little effort. This is no small feat when one considers that this was a war that was pretty much divided into at least five separate little wars that were connected only tenuously to each other. Add to that the several Indian Nations involved, most of which sided with the British but not all, and one tribe that divided up and fought each other and one has the makings of a convoluted mess. Borneman somehow manages to tie it all together without getting his readers completely lost and on top of that he keeps it interesting. Not only interesting I might add, but fascinating.Borneman's main contention is that the War of 1812 made the United States into a confident and united nation. He proves his point about American confidence fairly well and also shows that this war gained a good deal of respect for the U.S. among the powers of the world. The Monroe Doctrine would surely not have been possible before 1812 for no European nation would have paid it any attention at all.On the other hand Mr. Borneman falls short in his argument about the new unity of the United States as a result of the war. One of the chief handicaps that hampered American plans during the war was that the states didn't work well with the Federal Government or with each other for that matter. State militia units were constantly refusing to cross out of their states or into Canada, and Vermont and New York farmers were selling tons of supplies to the British. While the outcome of the war did no doubt strengthen American unity somewhat, there was still a long way to go and no matter Mr. Borneman's claims, the United States remained a plural term for many of it's citizens for many years to come.While the author's main thesis is not all that well supported by this book this is still an excellent short history of the War of 1812. It is highly readable, easy to follow and solidly researched. There is little or no new scholarship to be found here but for anyone who has a limited knowledge of this era of American history I would highly recommend this book. I would also think that even a student of this time period might find out a few new things within these pages for Mr. Borneman has brought a fairly complicated subject to life and has given it a focus.",

                "review/text": "1812 is a riveting account of a dangerous time in our country's history. For a nation only 20 years of age, one whose economic health was so dependent on overseas commerce, to emback so impetuously in a war with the world's greatest maritime power--a power who nearly was succesful in stillbirthing the nations's inception--seems foolhardy at best. The justifiable goals of war: impressmant of U.S. citizens for duty on Her Majesty's ships, the equally unreasonable Orders in Council, that forced the world's seagoing traders to pay protection to the crown, was laudable. But the American rallying cry for Canadian lands today smacks of hypocrisy, given our colonial past, and Jefferson's embargos caused more financial pain --self-inflicted-- than any policy Great Britain had imposed.As with the Revolution, this war put our national life fully on the line. In 1812, grievances that might have been successfully addressed with patience and diplomacy in the end, through war, built a national character--a sense of collective state's self-- that indeed forged a union that made the coming civil dispute a two-party war and not chaos between 18? states.I knew none of this, appreciated none of the fragility of our fledgling union before reading this book. Borneman writes compellingly, conversationally, and has a tremendous capacity for building a broader context for events and personalities that ultimately makes sense for what might otherwise be a cocophany of battles, places and people. I highly recommend 1812 The War That Forged a Nation for anyone wanting to add depth to their picture of our nation's formative years. The book belongs on the same shelf as McCullough's John Adams, Ambrose's Lewis and Clark, and Franklin's biography.",

I had read Remini's biography of Andrew Jackson (which I strongly recommend), and found that I knew nearly nothing about the War. Unlike America's previous battles, this one was essentially dominated by our Navy.As a result, I searched long and hard for a book on the war but found that there hasn't been much scholarship devoted to it. I picked up Borneman's book without knowing anything about it, and it is OK. It introduces the main themes of the war, its major battles, and goes into SOME details, not a lot.But the problem isn't so much in the details - I actually preferred getting a good overview the war, rather than being bogged down with too many details -- the problem was with the writing style. Borneman wrote the bulk of the book as I expect he likely tells his children about the war -- it's very casual and cliched. At some points though, it seems as if though he tried hard to impress us with his writing ability and descriptive prowess, much like an amateur poet, by throwing in many different figures of speech, oftentimes in the same sentence, and it sends the style over the top.Overall, the book is a decent introduction to the war. If you know nothing about it, this book will give you a familiarity with the war and the major figures. Just ignore the style.",

                "review/text": "The War of 1812 proved a great trial for the young United States. Not only did it include an effective British blockade on American shipping -- especially in the last year of the war -- but the Embargo Act of 1807 passed in Jefferson's second term led to a 90% decline in American exports before the war ever started. Across the country, wharves and warehouses were piled high with American goods and foodstuffs with nowhere to go.Who really wanted the war in the first place? It wasn't New England: Even while U.S. forces were engaged fighting the British in Canada, New England farmers made a good business selling beef to the enemy. The government in Washington was angry that American ships were being boarded by British warships and having crew members taken off because they \"looked\" like British deserters. The South was worried because the British forbade shipping cotton to Napoleon's France or to any of the mainland European countries he now occupied.Primarily, however, it was the West, which in those days meant Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio, which wanted to fight. The very thought that the British could interdict shipping down the Mississippi to the Port of New Orleans was a threat to the very existence of the newest of the United States. Henry Clay bragged in Congress that he could take 300 Kentucky militiamen and conquer Canada.That was not to be. The war on the ground took place in four theaters. It was the attempt to take Canada that was perhaps the biggest failure. Several U.S. armies came to grief because of bad military leadership, the unwillingness of militias to cross a national boundary, the inability to take advantage of a military victory (as at Lundy's Lane), and various other causes typical of green and poorly led troops. In time, good military leaders did emerge, especially Winfield Scott, but by then the focus was gone from Canada.The only real victories -- up until the very end -- were at sea. The duels between Old Ironsides and the Guerriere and Java stunned the British Admiralty. At Put-in-Bay on Lake Erie, Oliver Hazard Perry bested a flotilla put together by the British; and Commodore McDonough did the same at Plattsburg, NY, on Lake Champlain.The other two war theaters were Chesapeake Bay, in which the U.S. capital at Washington was put to the torch and Fort McHenry was bombarded, though little else of note occurred, and New Orleans. The latter, the only decisive victory by U.S. ground troops over British regulars (who had fought in Spain against Napoleon) took place after the peace treaty of Ghent was signed, but before the news of the signing had reached American shores.Borneman does a creditable job retelling the events of the War and the events leading up to it, complete with maps, footnotes, a useful bibliography, and illustrations of the major players. His conclusion that the war led to a national consciousness coming into existence, whereas before Americans thought of themselves primarily as residents of their states, comes at the tail end of the book. I would have liked to see a more detailed discussion of his hypothesis.By and large, however, I enjoyed the book enough to want to look into Borneman's other work. There are relatively few contemporary works about the period, and this one does do justice to its subject matter.",

Indeed, \"1812: The War That Forged A Nation\" is not only the best popular account I have read on this war, but is one of the finest popular histories on the early history of the United States I have encountered so far. To his credit, Borneman traces the origins of the war back to Aaron Burr's infamous conspiracy to create a new \"Western Empire\" in the frontier country of Ohio and the remainder of the Northwest Territory, and the desires of some Westerners eager to add Canada and Florida to the United States. Perhaps these, more so than British impressment of American sailors, were the root causes behind the War of 1812, which Borneman implies in the opening chapters of the book. And he reveals - at least to me - a hitherto unknown dimension of the war itself, noting how close both the United States Congress and President James Madison came to not declaring war against Great Britain. Once war is declared, Borneman does an elegant job describing all of the major campaigns in Canada and along the western and southern frontiers; he correctly notes the bravery of Canadians defending themselves from the American invaders as well as the gross incompetence of most American generals, with the notable exceptions of Brown, Scott, and especially, Jackson. He also makes a very persuasive case that the American victory at the Battle of Lake Champlain was the most important naval battle of the war, not the Battle of Lake Erie or any of the brilliant frigate duels won by the likes of Captains Hull and Decatur. He also provides sympathetic portrayals of British generals such as Brock and Ross during their respective campaigns in the Great Lakes and Maryland (And yet, I can't help but notice just how incompetent much of the British military - as well as American military - leadership was during the conduct of this war.).

He definitely keeps you interested in the story throughout the book. You even find yourself at times hanging on at the end of a chapter as if you were reading a novel.This book has many unique features which places it above your average history book. For example, as the book progresses Mr. Borneman provides detailed background of all the major personalities involved in the war in a real Stephen King-like fashion which thus adds more depth and interest to the characters as the narration continues. Another entertaining facet of the book is that he is able to arrouse enough interest in the personalities so that you can easily follow their actions as the war progresses. It is rare that you find yourself looking back in the book because you forgot a name or couldn't follow the story.The only thing that prevents me from giving this book a 5 star rating is the few flaws that slightly mar the book. Granted they are forgiveable, nonetheless flaws are present. I doubt they will deter you from purchasing this book, but in case they are of concern, I feel it necessary to mention them. First of all I was disappointed with the quality of the maps. I have ready plenty of history books and one of the most interesting things you find in them is that they are replete with maps of major military campaigns and battles. This book was \"very\" sparce on them with the exception of some naval battles. Also I feel that the conclusion of the book was a little rushed and lacking. For instance, one of the key reasons for going to war was over sailor impressment. Yet the concluding remarks does little to enlighten the reader as to how this issue was resolved after the war. Perhaps Mr. Borneman may consider rewriting the concluding remarks of the book with more details. Otherwise by the end you feel you need to look in an encyclopedia after reading the book to answer some questions that are still on your mind.All in all I enjoyed the book. It was quite easy to read and I would highly recommend it for parents or teachers who are encouraging children and students to develop an interest in history.

There is no doubt that had the Americans failed to perform as admirably as they did on the ocean, the war would have been easily won by the British very early. Had the Americans performed better during the land battles, they could have easily knocked the British out of North America and won a handy victory in short order.In the end, the war turned out to be 3 years of brutal fighting on the North American continent; everywhere from Canada to New Orleans that did not appear to accomplish anything militarily, but it did indeed lead to the different sections of America (New England, the South, the West, etc.) to join together and become the United States of America.For anyone looking for a solid treatment of the war, I would highly recommend this book.

Furthermore war releases the work of compassion and love for the needy which breaks through all barriers of naturally given groups, and it does this as a mass phenomenon. Religion, from its side, can only in general provide a similar ethic of brotherliness in the heroic-warrior communities. And furthermore war performs something for the combatant himself that is quite distinctive in his sensibility: the perception of the meaning and consecration of death, which belongs to him alone. The community of the standing army in the field is today aware of itself as a community until death, the greatest of its kind - just as in the times of the warrior bands. . . Death in arms, only here in this massiveness of death, can the individual believe he knows that he dies `for' something.\"Max Weber, Intermediate Reflection, ca 1916Few would believe in such sentiments today. Weber himself did not look at the war the same way two years later, although his quoted comments were meant to describe the \"meaning\" individuals placed in war, as members of a political community of destiny, comparing it with religious sentiments.William Pfaff's The Bullet's Song is arguably his best book. Here he takes a subjective look at the great crisis or complexus of crises that arose with the First World War. With the chivalric moral values that underpinned Western Liberalism destroyed by the war, a vacuum resulted that had to be replaced with something. Unfortunately for humanity that something was a series of militant and irrational utopianisms that have led to an unprecedented series of man-made global disasters. As Pfaff implies we are not at the end of this tendency, might actually be in the grips of the last and potentially most powerful of these secular replacements for God. \"The enemy is identified as a metaphysical or spiritual reality. . . This marks an advance of American political thought toward the darkness of totalitarian conceptions and discourse, translating human conflict into metaphysical combat.\" Page 309. Also \"it is easy to conceive of the future in Hobbesian terms of totally self-interested power struggles, however disguised these may be in the rhetoric of liberalism\". Page 307. And finally \"It is essential to recognize the possibility that the disordered and morally catastrophic century in which the persons in my book lived might represent our future and not only our past.\" Page 319.Pfaff looks at these utopian ideas from the perspectives of seven main biographies of men who were caught up in the confusion and promise of their times and attempted to resolve their sense of chivalry with the confusing and massive violence around them. All came up short and some ended up turning on the very ideals they had suffered so much to fulfil. In the end all the main characters arrived at a certain clarity of what their actions had achieved or failed to achieve or had unintentionally achieved. They had got beyond their own ideals/ideology and realized their distinctly human limitations, or perhaps the (un)avoidable tragedy, farce and chance of human experience?This is no minor issue today in a time of schizophrenic public debate/information available, which relies on endless and ambiguous assumption . You are suppose to \"just know\" which way to go, whom to follow. But it never really works out that way.Instead, we always struggle with a compromise of irreconcilable values - which is the curse of modern times. Somebody always gets screwed over - either your parents, or your kids, or your spouse, or yourself. Endless value conflicts in a war of opposing \"gods\" who fight on in dis-enchanted form as obscure interests. Whereas before there was only the absolute ethic, there is in modernity a variety of warring value \"spheres\" - Weber defined modernity in terms of the conflict in values interacting with modern social processes. What Pfaff really seems to lament is the loss of this absolute ethic, what Medieval Christianity for example promised and for generations many believed . . . His appeal seems to me that of a modern follower of Thomas Aquinus, someone looking for a synthesis of reason and faith, which is unfortunately not possible in the modern West. Or is he more in the line of the stoics and Marcus Aurelius, actually appealing to a pre-Christian ethic?In any case, as Nietzsche indicated, it was not the end of chivalry as a value set, but the end of the absolute ethic that Christianity once supplied that was the crisis facing the West. The lack of that absolute ethic, transcending all other values - what after all could compete with serving the Lord and safeguarding one's own everlasting soul? - has been replaced by a return to \"polytheism\" as Weber described. This of course pre-dated 1914, so what was the effect of the war? The war acted as a catalyst, quickening the pace of change, challenging the old values and notions which did not survive this \"hammer\". Nietzsche said that new values were necessary and that we as individuals would have to choose them. Few are up to such a challenge, even today, so the tendency is to find a replacement for the lost absolute ethic in political ideology or retreat and attempt a \"re-enchantment\" of religion or other traditional dogma.This is where Pfaff's ideal falls short imo, since it requires a rather extensive \"surrender of the intellect\", in effect repeating the same sort of commitment (this time a return to traditional Christianity or Christian-like stoicism) without questioning what might be the unintended results of those commitments. Even a Marcus Aurelius was afterall the father of a Commodus. In this way, Max Weber's ideal of the politician balancing the ethic of responsibility with that of conviction, yet being conscious of the historical processes and tragic outcomes that befall human endeavour, is more intellectually appealing than Pfaff's call for a re-enchantment of the lost Christianity of our great-grandparents. Pfaff's idea of virtue is based on ascetic self-denial and sacrifice \"to achieve perfection in the performance of something of no inherent utility\" (page 311), but it was Nietzsche again in his influential 3rd Essay in The Genealogy of Morals that showed this ascetic ideal as the mother of science which leads us back to the confusion or debasement of all values, since as in his example of Ernst J&uuml;nger's focused and scientific study of beetles, even science can have no \"inherent utility\".Still the journey that William Pfaff takes you on to reach his conclusions is an impressively insightful view of the 20th Century and the sanguinary ideologies that caused it to destroy much of the tottering moral universe that had existed at its beginning. He knows his history, especially of the struggle against Communism and his description of Willi M&uuml;nzenberg and the Comintern provides much that makes some of the current methods of mass persuasion comprehensible. Contrary to those who think that recent actions of groups to undermine the legitimacy of the state is something new (referred to often as 4th Generation Warfare), Pfaff shows that it was in reality Soviet policy from the 1920's on. It all comes down to how one defines the state.This brings up another important question that Pfaff never asks. If the attitude as expressed in the Weber quote no longer expresses Western attitudes towards war, how come it does in fact express the attitudes of many in the world today, those political communities fighting for what they consider their very existence? I suspect that a fighter in the current Iraqi resistance, or among the Palestinians of the West Bank, would find Weber's view of 1916 obviously correct.Here, I mention America since it is only in America, only here in the West, where anything approaching the old chivalric ethic still survives. Who in America joins the military with the idea that they would welcome a hero's death? That their death would have special meaning for the entire community that they represent? That's not really it, is it? Does not in fact every volunteer join with the idea that he or she will undoubtedly survive and experience old age, with grandchildren on their knee, telling of their service for the great cause? It is more the trappings of the old ethic that attracts us, discounting the materialist incentives, the shards of the old ethos, not the moral ideal - the real essence - that attracts us. When the reality intrudes we react bitterly - \"how could such a thing happen?\"Should we lament this fact? It is in fact only in the West, and in Japan, India, South Africa, much of South America. . . where we have nothing left to fight and die for. Our societies are either prosperous and powerful, or we are not willing to take a violent alternative due to historical experience. Beyond attack in most senses, even the \"threats\" more the nature of \"blowback\" of our own failed Western policies, better dealt with as a police matter. Obviously a war for oil would never command the same sort of devotion or commitment, which is why our current war(s) have to be packaged with compelling masks. . .This is all within Pfaff's argument, which makes it a powerful one. One which wouldallow humanity to focus on the real dangers at hand. We need not fear each other, but rather need to address questions concerning our environmental survival, not a moral question at all since it does not involve a choice.One last comment: Pfaff seems to misread Leo Strauss (page 307) since Strauss rejects Natural Law - divine or otherwise - and argues Natural Right (see Natural Right and History vii). Strauss's view is that the rational can achieve objectivity and can create objective theory on which to base social/political policy. It is in reality, yet another utopian fantasy as we see today with those who have convinced themselves that when they act they create their own reality, are history's unquestioned actors. There is no misunderstanding of Strauss's message by his current followers, rather its deterministic conclusion, as in the conclusion of every other utopian fantasy that Pfaff describes.Finally, one should discount the Washington Post review provided here since the reviewer obviously misunderstands Pfaff's argument. The civil rights movement was not utopian in the sense Pfaff uses the word, but a demand for justice, a democratic movement, contrary to the totalitarian utopias described in the book.",

                "review/text": "People delude themselves into believing that they are on the right path, dreaming of a better life for their putative descendants. Pfaff has a trenchant, aphoristic style, filled with the thunder of Herman Melville, always sweeping argument off the table with his fist, and I admire the way he brings back the spirit of Mencken into his newspaper writing when he goes about his business writing op ed pieces and the like for the International Herald Trib. This book, however, is something with a little more scope, a biographical study of six influential authors who sought to improve the world with advanced political views, and who, in general, made a mishmash of things without even trying. Many Americans will read this book and see a tragic reflection of our own nation's current political nightmare, like looking into the dark hand mirror of Snow White's wicked stepmother.Many of us will know Lawrence of Arabia at least from the movie, but the lives of some of the other adventurer-authors will be fairly obscure, like Junger, or once notorious, now obscure as history turns a spade onto their graves (like Andre Malraux, whose books my father loved). Sometimes they simply collapse under Pfaff's cool scorn. And sometimes they snap back, like saplings in spring after the snow melts, and whip back in our faces with unexpected force. You might feel that Pfaff has taken his old copy of \"The God That Failed\" and carved up the pages and presented it as a new book, but he has actually done a fair amount of original research and the stew is tasty.I wish that Pfaff had included at least one American in his study of six men. The implication as it stands is that men of many nations have gone mad through devotion to extreme politics, but Americans are immune. (As are women I guess.) We know from Pfaff's previous books that he does not feel this way at all. He might have written in depth about the strange case of Ezra Pound, who likewise felt himself to be a progressive on every level, but who judged from the outside died insane, as he had lived.",

        "description": "\"For nearly two years during the War of 1812, the British treated the Chesapeake Bay as their private lake. But in 1814, as attention moved from the northern frontier to the mid-Atlantic region, the Americans fought back and drove the invaders from the bay. Christopher T. George traces the abuses of the inhabitants of the Chesapeake Bay by Royal Navy raiding parties under arrogant Rear Admiral George Cockburn. Cockburn's burning and pillaging of bay communities preceded the burning of our nation's capital, Washington, D.C., on August 24-25, 1814, by Major General Robert Ross. Cockburn persuaded Ross that the Americans could not stand up to Lord Wellington's Peninsular War veterans. But he miscalculated when it came to attacking Baltimore, where citizen soldiers, strongly led by Revolutionary War veterans Generals Samuel Smith and John Stricker, and backed by U.S. Navy regulars, held the British at bay, killing Ross and reclaiming American pride.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

                "review/text": "The War of 1812 was a watershed for the United States; it was the first time we declared war on another nation. So, how did we do? For one, we gained recognition as a member of the world community. But more importantly, we relied on the militia to prosecute the war and learned some hard facts about their utility as a main defense force. This is the focus of Professor C. Edward Skeen. CITIZEN SOLDIERS seeks to describe the federal use of the militia to augment the regular army; survey the militia's performance in general; and review the operational aspects of militia participation at the state level (p. 1).The fifty-five delegates of the Constitutional Convention believed state governments should provide a counterbalance to the national government. State sovereignty and individual liberty were paramount when the time came to provide for the common defense. This resulted in the militia system of national defense, which had its flaws. Although the federal government provided for \"organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia\" during wartime and could mobilize state militias to \"execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions,\" states reserved the right to regulate the militia and appoint their own officers (p. 5). Thus, the federal government wrote the regulations for the militia while state governments regulated the militia.Six of the author's ten chapters are devoted to federal-state relations and the organization and mobilization of the militia. The other four chapters are the meat of the book; they evaluate the combat performance of the militia and support Skeen's main treatise: Although the minutemen fought well under the right circumstances, the War of 1812 proved that America could not rely on the militia to serve as its first line of defense.Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry bested the British on Lake Erie in 1813. This enabled General William Henry Harrison to destroy Tecumseh and break the back of the Indian confederacy. Skeen concludes that the outcome of these campaigns \"were attributable to the militia\" (p. 95), even if their record in combat was undistinguished.Meanwhile along the Niagara, General Peter B. Porter of New York rallied the militia and routed the British at Battle of Black Rock. Skeen singles out Porter as the quintessential militia leader of the war: \"[Porter] demonstrated persuasively that militiamen, capably led, were effective fighters\" (p. 107).Along the eastern seaboard, the Royal Navy sailed into Chesapeake Bay, put troops ashore at Benedict on 18 August, and invested Washington during the Battle of Bladensburg in 1814. According to Skeen, \"The Battle of Bladensburg represented probably the worst example of militia performance in the war. It illustrated in microcosm all of the things wrong with the militia in the War of 1812\" (p. 138). They were poorly organized and equipped and they lacked unit cohesion and leadership.The outnumbered British were opposed by 7,000 Americans led by Brigadier General William Winder, whose \"chief qualification [to command] was that he was a nephew of Levin Winder, governor of Maryland\" (p. 130). Although Winder's force was predominantly militia, which Winder himself blamed for the eventual outcome of the battle--it was the leadership, not the composition of the American force that led to their defeat. Simply put, Winder was incompetent.The British withdrew from Baltimore and the Chesapeake Bay area in September 1814 and shifted their focus to the southern theater along the Gulf of Mexico. Fortunately--for the sake of the militia--the militiamen in the South performed better than their brothers did along the eastern seaboard. Andrew Jackson's dramatic victory at New Orleans was the major battle in the Southern theater and the capstone of the War of 1812. Skeen believes Jackson's leadership of the militia \"showed once again that, under the right circumstances, given proper leadership, discipline, training, and arms and equipment, American militiamen were capable of fighting\" (p. 174).CITIZEN SOLDIERS is at its best refereeing the arguments over the militia between the states and the federal government. For example, the New England states believed their governors reserved the right to decide when the militia should be mobilized, not President James Madison. They questioned the federal government's declaration of war and balked at mobilizing their militia because, they claimed, the war was unconstitutional (pp. 65-72). In fact, many of the militiamen that did fight still refused to cross the Canadian border because they believed it \"unconstitutional.\"Unfortunately, CITIZEN SOLDIERS assumes a working knowledge of the War of 1812. Although Skeen gives enough coverage of each theater of operations to support his arguments, he does not offer enough depth for his book to stand alone as a history of the war.In closing, I don't think CITIZEN SOLDIERS has broken any new ground. Donald R. Hickey has already produced the definitive history of the war with his WAR OF 1812: A FORGOTTEN CONFLICT (Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1989). Likewise, John K. Mahon has already told us all there is to know about citizen soldiers and the militia with his HISTORY OF THE MILITIA AND THE NATIONAL GUARD (New York: Macmillan, 1983) and THE AMERICAN MILITIA: DECADE OF DECISION, 1789-1800 (Gainesville: University of Florida Press, 1960). Yet, thanks to a Herculean research effort, Citizen Soldiers is a winner. Skeen's endnotes and bibliographic essay evidence his extensive documentary research in state and federal archives. He has done well in marshalling evidence from primary and secondary sources and carries his main argument: \"[The War of 1812 showed that] the militia was an unreliable main defense force&quot; (p. 3).",

The War of 1812 happened a mere 25 years after the Constitution was drafted and debated. The federal government had been charged with &quot;organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia&quot; under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution had done what the Anti-federalists had feared (despite the Second Amendment guarantees) of ignoring the militia in favor of a standing federal military. The militia was poorly armed and did not know how to use the weapons they were provided. The professional soldiers could not tolerate the lack of disciplne of the militia. The problem is that the language of the Constitutional debates no longer is understood; however, the United States had to live with the institution of the militia as its first line of defence.

It is centered mostly on the southern states and nearly ignores actions along the coast north of Maryland. The book is a constant jab and bash at the militia system to the point of boredom. I don't believe anyone expected a militia system that trained 4 days a year to be anything but a speed bump to veteran British regiments. The system did what it was supposed to do and countered local raids and was the 'first' line of defense against invasion.The book spends alot of time on the political troubles of the system and explains it well in a somewhat chaotic manner. Many first hand sources are used, but sometimes takes the author to the same incorrect conclusion as others before him. Modern studies that discount old myths seem to be ignored.A couple of chapters that let me down were the 'Militia Organization' and 'The Atlantic Front..'. The first boils down to two paragraghs that give very general details of organization. I was shocked that artillery and cavalry were left out. No mention of the French military influence or the basics of 'standing militia', 'elite militia (lights, rifles, artillery and cavalry)' and 'volunteers'. The second chapters covers New England in two paragraphs that are poorly researched. Both are primary sources that are biased and inaccurate. Maine was actually invaded and occupied until well after the war with the intent to adding it to Canada. The New England states did not perform any better, however they were better organized and equipped than most.The militia battle in Stonington/New London, CT mentioned on p. 130. barely gets a paragraph, but a positve chapter would counter the book's theme.Sadly the author ignores the 'Laws of War' at that time which generally stated 'armed resistence of a city would forfeit it'. A key consideration for local militia and their homes and shops.The fault was not with the militia, most countries had such systems, it is that the US depended too much on it.",

        "description": "First published in 1986, James Belich's groundbreaking book and the television series based upon it transformed New Zealanders' understanding of New Zealand's great \"civil war\": struggles between Maori and Pakeha in the 19th century. Revealing the enormous tactical and military skill of Maori, and the inability of the Victorian interpretation of racial conflict to acknowledge those qualities, Belich's account of the New Zealand Wars offered a very different picture from the one previously given in historical works.

This book is essentially a vehicle for promoting his revisionist agenda. Much of the content has already been shot down by a variety of military historians, including current Senior Lecturer of War Studies at Sandhurst, Christopher Pugsley.Belich reels off a series of ludicrous claims including:- The Maori 'invented' trench warfare in the mid-19th century (trenches had already been used in European conflicts, with the Lines of Torre Vedras being case in point)- Gate Pa took heavier shellfire per square inch than any point of the Somme in WW1 ( Gate Pa had an 8-hour bombardment with 16 field pieces and one large-calibre naval gun, as compared to 950 large-calibre modern artillery pieces deluging Bazentin Ridge with 650lb of shells per metre)- In the Anglo-Zulu War, Ulundi wasn't a 'great victory' (2,000+ Zulu dead, the capture of Cetshwayo and the burning of the Zulu capital apparently doesn't constitute a 'great victory')The book is a heavily distorted version of events coloured not only by the author's political bias, but by the fact he simply doesn't understand the mechanics of 19th century warfare and has no frame of reference to work from. He also deliberately omits key facts when they conflict with his views and cherrypicks quotes (often out of context) while ignoring contradictory material from the same source.A classic example is in Chapter 5, where Belich devotes 8 pages to the battle of Puketakuuere (which is fair enough), while the crushing Maori defeat at Redoubt No.3 (one of the heaviest by either side in the whole campaign) is covered in a single sentence with no mention of casualties. The later abortive Maori attack on Sentry Hill is also covered in a single sentence, with no reference to the 30+ Maori killed in the action. An interesting aside is that the Maori at Sentry Hill believed their 'Hau Hau' incantations and hand gestures would magically protect them from bullets as they casually sauntered towards the redoubt in open order. Predictably, Belich doesn't touch this with a bargepole.Then there's the more serious matter of Belich being caught making authoritive reference to fabricated quotes. When confronted about this, he attempted to claim that the 'quotes' he invented reflected the general views of the historical figure in question and it was something they 'would have said'. This kind of thing is generally referred to in academic circles as LYING.Basically, Belich has no credibility as a military historian whatsoever and this book was written expressly to rewrite history to match his ideals.",

Not only is Belich's thesis that the native Maori were tactical and strategic wizards that were more than capable of facing the might of Imperial Britain (and in the process 'invented' a totally new form of trench warfare) profoundly flawed, the manner in which be supports his thesis is somewhat dubious. Belich frequently leaves out information that conflicts with his argument and often deliberately misquotes sources in support of what he wants to say.The disagreement and debate regarding any given interpretation of an event is a normal and even critical part of the academic or social environment. The fact that Belich presents a revisionist thesis on a subject that has not been comprehensively dealt with for 60 or so years is to be applauded, and certainly the fact that it has provoked a renewed interest in the subject here in New Zealand is wonderful. Alas what is not so good is a social historian who masquerades as a military historian who, when he cannot bend a source to fit his thesis, ignores it.Roel van Leeuwen mithras@wave.co.nz",

The book opens with an inequivocal statement of intent: \"This is a revisionist history of the New Zealand Wars.\" Although it was initially hailed as a brilliant new interpretation, however, large sections have since been discredited in detail.As examples, Belich claims (incorrectly) that Maori invented modern trench warfare; that the Ngapuhi chiefs Hone Heke and Kawiti 'won' the Northern War of 1845-6; that the British never understood, and therefore could not counter, Maori strategy; that the British defeat at Gate Pa in 1864 was the result of a Maori 'ambush'....the list goes on. What is interesting is that no military historian - Maori or non-Maori - has ever endorsed his interpretation.Belich's reputation suffered a blow in 1998, when a television series based on this book was parodied by satirists and ridiculed by military historians. His reputation suffered what should have been a fatal blow in 2000, when it was revealed that some of the references in the book did not exist, but had been 'created' to support the argument. Belich's dwindling number of supporters are now reduced to making silly comments about his critics, rather than debating points on their merits.Notwithstanding, this book is worth reading. However, it must be read alongside the earlier works that Belich dimisses with such contempt (particularly Cowan's 'New Zealand Wars'). Readers should be aware that Belich has no standing as a military historian. This is most clearly demonstrated by his use of the terms 'strategy' and 'tactics' indiscriminately, and his complete lack of comprehension of operational art.Probably the book's greatest value is as a demonstration of revisionism 'gone too far', and what happens when a historian arranges the 'facts' to suit his or her thesis, rather than testing his or her thesis against the facts.",

Nor has this triumph merely been confined to the CPUSA or to Marxists. Even moderate liberals like Mondale or Dukakis stand discredited in the Orwellian weltanschung. This book is a collection of essays by a series of leading scholars which criticize this consensus.There is much to be said for it. (1) We have an essay by Carolyn Eisenberg that draws on her book on how American partioned Germany. Discussing the Berlin Blockade, she points out the United States negoiated in bad faith, avoided possiblities to compromise, and undercut the Allied Control Council and the United Nations. (Fortunately for the American reputation, the Canadians successfully prevented the UN Security Council President from releasing a report that would criticize the United States.) The United States never wanted to discuss the currency questions that sparked the blockade, because it would hamper its plans to partition Germany. Moreover, the blockade was not as complete as people think (West Berlin still had access to the rest of Berlin and the Eastern Zone). (2) Chalmers Johnson contains a good piece of muckraking about the pathologies of American dominance. The United States, along with Somalia is the only country to oppose the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It opposes the ICC, the land mines treaty, and UN resolutions to adhere to the ABM treaty. We've learned that Chilean secret police man who ordered the Letellier/Moffit murder was a \"paid CIA agent\" and continued this status after blowing up a bomb in the streets of Washington. Another DINA officer helped to torture and murder a UN official in 1976, and then served as an instructor at Fort Benning in human rights in 1987. (3) We also have useful essays by Nelson Lichtenstein on how postwar intellectuals as varied as Schumpeter, Bell, Galbraith, Drucker and Mills thought that the new corporate factory bureaucracy was making capitalism obsolete, only to be rudely refuted by history. (4) We have a typically nuanced essay by Leo Ribuffo discussing the morality of the cold war as discussed by Reinhold Niebuhr, William Appleman Williams and John Lewis Gaddis. We also have more caustic essays by Bruce Cumings about the fatuities of Cold war triumphalism, taking special aim at the castrated Nietzche of Francis Fukuyama. We also have Ellen Schrecker and Maurice Isserman provide some useful context about the VENONA spy disclosures, and Corey Robin about neoconservative rhetoric on 9/11. (He is effective about the contrast between neoconservative chatter about noble striving and sacrifice and a free market mindset so powerful that 62 senators could vote in March 2002 against higher fuel efficiency standards.)However, I would like to point out some reservations. (1) There is nothing that directly discusses John Earl Haynes' recent polemic \"In Denial\" which accuses several of the contributors of being like Holocaust deniers. (2) Not all of the essays are equally useful. Michael Bernstein's paper just reiterates the flaws of Reaganomics. An article by Marilyn Young on the Vietnam War and the Gulf Wars is uninspiring, as is another paper on the role of the United Nations. There is little new material; the Lichtenstein and Ribuffo articles are an exception. (3) There is little specifically on Eastern Europe, except for the Eisenberg essay on the Berlin Blockade. This makes Ribuffo's comment, that historical research suggests that the Soviets were rather hesistant about invading Hungary in 1956, all the more tantalizing. (4) The articles do not all agree on everything. That in itself is not a problem, but I must make a reservation over Ribuffo's discussion of Williams. Williams was willing to grant Japan a sphere of influence in China, and the USSR a sphere in Eastern Europe. But Japan's conduct in China was incredibly vicious, and the United States was not obliged to sell them the materials to conduct war there. Nor was it unfair to wish that the Warsaw Pact countries were as democratic as Finland, though somewhat hypocritical that dictatorships in the rest of the world could be glibly ignored. And to describe neoconservatives as \"utopian,\" as Robin does, for claiming to encourage the spread of democracy is to give them too much credit and to take their rhetoric at face value.",

There is a remarkable diversity in the recipes, thanks to the largely rural readership of Godey's Lady's Book and to the immigrant influence on the country in the 1860s. Fish and game were readily available in rural America, and the number of seafood recipes testifies to the abundance of the coastal waters and rivers. The country cook was a frugal cook, particularly during wartime, so there are a great many recipes for leftovers and seasonal produce. In addition to a wide sampling of recipes that can be used today, Civil War Recipes includes information on Union and Confederate army rations, cooking on both homefronts, and substitutions used during the war by southern cooks.",

                "review/text": "The Politics of the Weather UndergroundVolunteers of AmericaBy RON JACOBSIn 1997 Verso published my history of the Weather Underground, The Way the Wind Blew: a History of the Weather Underground. Weather Underground member Bill Ayers' memoir Fugitive Days, published by Beacon Press in 2001, followed. Two years later, the film The Weather Underground, directed by Sam Green and Bill Siegel, was released. The film probably received the greatest amount of coverage in the mainstream media, although the unfortunate timing of Weather Underground member Bill Ayers' memoir (September 11, 2001) certainly provided his book with its own share, most of it negative.There have also been novels written where the WUO figured prominently (most notably The Company You Keep by Neil Gordon Viking 2003), a pamphlet written by political prisoner David Gilbert (SDS/WUO, Students For A Democratic Society And The Weather Underground Organization, Arm the Spirit 2002) and the comparative study of the Weather Underground and the German leftist armed organization, the Red Army Fraction, by Jeremy Varon (Bringing the War Home: The Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction, and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies; UC Press 2004).AK Press of Oakland, California is adding another book to this growing library of Weather Underground literature. The book, titled Outlaws of America and written by up-and-coming radical author Dan Berger, is an important complement to the earlier works. The first history of the Weather Underground Organization(WUO) to be written by someone whose age parallels the ages of the children of WUO members and many other \"sixties\" activists (Berger is 24), this well-researched and detailed work provides a perspective on the most well-known group in the militant wing of the anti-racist and antiwar movement. The book is essential to understanding the history of the 1960s, as well as the present movements against racism and imperialist war.Two things make this book different than the one I got published 8 years ago. The first, and probably the greatest, is that Berger had access to the research and work that went into Green's film and my book. In addition, he also had much greater access to many of the personalities involved in the Weather organization. Green had a similar access. Things were a bit different when I was writing my book (1990-1997). Queries I sent to those members in prison were returned to me by prison officials, never having reached their intended recipient. Only a few individuals who had been in Weatherman/WUO were willing to talk with me and only two were willing to go on record. Others were willing to tell me if my story was accurate or not, but refused to discuss any specifics. One reason for this was the timing of my queries. After all, many Weather members were still unsure of their legal status and, politically, the US Left was still reeling from the effects of the incredibly reactionary Reagan era--a period that saw many members of the militant US left imprisoned and its infrastructure destroyed. In addition, hardly anyone that I approached knew my politics--which were a cross between the countercultural anarchism of the Yippies and the new communist movement of the 1970s. Berger and others have mentioned that my book helped to make it okay for WUO to be discussed as a force in US radical history. I was sent dozens of emails and letters from people telling me their stories as members of WUO or other militant groups after my book was published verifying this impression.The other major difference between my work and Outlaws of America is that Berger writes from the perspective of today's generation of radical activists. (Indeed, Berger is co-editor of the recently released collection Letters From Young Activists.) His perspective is that of an anti-imperialist who came of age in the 1990s, not the 1960s and 1970s. This obviously provides a different perspective simply because the face of US imperialism has changed, with the end of the Soviet Union and its allies, and the rise of two worldwide movements against Western capitalism--the anti-global capitalism surge and the Islamic movement against the west. Both of these movements have varied strains and are only semi-consciously aware of the connections they share. Besides providing a different perspective on the WUO because of the difference in the historical situation, Berger's viewpoint is one that is not laden with the personality conflicts and ego battles that are part and parcel of every \"Sixties\" activist's recollection of the WUO. On top of that, Berger's historical distance means that he sometimes places his emphasis on words and actions that have more importance now than they did when they occurred. This tends to provide a more congruous history. At times, his words may seem too uncritical, but as another historian who was accused of the same thing, it is my belief that most of those who make this criticism are either fundamentally opposed to WUO's politics and analysis or are still stuck in a past that most Weather members have apologized for over and over.Outlaws of America begins with a gripping description of Berger's first visit to Attica State Prison to interview/converse with former weather Underground member David Gilbert, who has been in the New York prison system since a conviction for his involvement in the tragic failure popularly known as the Nyack Brink's robbery. Berger obviously has a tremendous amount of respect for Gilbert's commitment while simultaneously understanding the tragedy of his position. In fact, each chapter begins with a quote from Gilbert--a technique that provides the reader with a glimpse of Berger's general perspective while never merely repeating Gilbert's take on things.Much of the book's beginning is a general history of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and the dissipation of that organization into Weatherman, Revolutionary Youth Movement 2, and SDS/Progressive Labor. Using an academically-trained critical eye, Berger analyzes key documents published in the SDS newspaper New Left Notes and explicates the role these writings had in the political development of Weather. His generational removal from the times allows for an analysis that accepts the fervent anti-racism and struggle against white privilege that would become Weather's theoretical backbone at face value. This is important to Berger's history. Once he establishes these elements as the basis for Weather's politics, Berger is able to provide the reader with a history of the Weatherman/Weather Underground Organization that would make its former members critically proud.Given this, one might argue that while Outlaws of America might make former WUO members proud, it certainly couldn't be a good history if it accepts their political premise. After all, how could such a history be at all critical? To Berger's credit, it is the very fact that he uses the yardstick of Weather's essential political stance as the measure by which they should be judged that this history works as well as it does. It is apparent from his writing that his interviews with former members caused them to look at their actions and political words in relation to how well they measured up to their emotional and intellectual commitment to fighting racism, imperialism, and the white privilege these isms provide to white folks in the US.As an activist who sees things differently than Weather did in terms of emphasis on fighting white privilege, I am more than willing to admit that it was their focus on this element of US society that made me aware of the phenomenon of white privilege and reminded me to fight it in myself and the larger world. On the other hand, my relationships with workers who also happened to be white led me to draw different conclusions about the way the phenomena of racism, white privilege, and economic exploitation interact in modern capitalist society. Of course, I was (and am) but one of hundreds of thousands pondering these questions. And they are important questions, to be sure.Outlaws of America explores the final years of Weather in greater detail than its predecessors. In addition, Berger provides considerably more detail about the law enforcement activities arrayed against the WUO and its allies. This is one important part of the text where the element of time works in the author's favor. Not only is there more information regarding the law enforcement activities against the 1960s and 1970s popular leftist and anti-racist organizations, it is also much more accessible. This fact combined with Weather members willingness to discuss their years underground helps Berger flesh out the facts of State repression against the New Left, Black, Latino and Native American organizations, and especially the WUO. As regards the final years of Weather, the fact that many more former members feel safe in discussing the activities and politics of the group provided Berger with an opportunity to uncover the material. Of course, unless he asked the right questions, he would not have discovered what he did. Fortunately, Berger not only asked the right questions, he found enough former members willing to discuss their answers with him. Consequently, the reader is provided with the most complete explanation to date of how and why the Weather Underground Organization fell apart. Like every other aspect of its existence, the fundamental reasons were political. The stories and discussions in this section are instructive for today's movements as they struggle with questions of class, race, and gender.Berger's best writing occurs when he weaves the modern-day reflections of former WUO members into his narrative text. He does this so skillfully that those reminiscences never come off sounding awkward or irrelevant. Sometimes these reflections merely add a bit of physical detail, while more often they provide a contextual insight into what these women and men were thinking while they lived and took political action underground. This is what makes this book different and useful to the historian, the \"sixties\" buff, and the political activist of today. These people lived the life of clandestine revolutionaries and this book proves that they made the choices they made because of their politics. It wasn't because of some guilt due to class privilege, nor was their choice related to some psychological occurrence of their childhood. Even more than the previous works about Weatherman/WUO, Outlaws of America brings it home, especially to the US reader, that people do make choices (life-changing choices) based on their politics. This in itself is revelatory in a culture that thinks politics begins with the Republicans and ends with the Democrats.There's some criticism in these pages, too. To be sure, it's criticism from a left perspective, and that's a good thing. Those to the right of the US Left--and there are many--will read this book only under duress and rarely with an open mind. The reviews of the aforementioned works on the subject attest to that. Although I hope that Outlaws of America is read by people of all political persuasions, it's clear that it is intended for the growing left/anarchist movements of today and the New Left with its roots in yesterday. If those of us in that readership are to learn from history, it's very important that we critique that history. It's even better when that criticism comes from a variety of viewpoints. I hope this book, besides being an excellent read, sparks a new element in that conversation.(Reviewer's note: March 6 marks the 36th anniversary of the deaths of Weathermembers Diana Oughton, Terry Robbins, and Ted Gold in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion.)Ron Jacobs is author of The Way the Wind Blew: a history of the Weather Underground, which is just republished by Verso.

                "review/text": "In attempting to construct yet another history of the storied Weather Underground and the tumultuous era of \"The Sixties\", author Dan Berger endeavors to become heir to the New Left and \"anti-imperialist\" mantle. The book, replete with stilted, politically archaic and often strident rhetorical catchphrases offers precious few new historical facts, no new perspectives and makes for generally tedious reading.The history of the group is traced from its origins through its demise. The WUO arose from the much larger SDS. The break from Students for a Democratic Society was engineered by a classical Leninist move: a small, self-proclaimed leadership circle whose extreme views set it in opposition to most SDS members expelled elements that espoused \"competing lines\". Its emphasis on race and \"white privilege\" was expressed as support for just about any and all \"Third World Liberation movements\". After initially denying the traditional \"Old Left\" class-based social and economic analysis, the WUO \"platform\" as defined by the group leaders, gradually morphed into conventional Marxism. In the process, virtually all sympathetic and potentially sympathetic segments of society were alienated, as were many Weather \"cadres\", essentially none of whom were consulted regarding this or other policies. The vitriolic attacks on those who held differing opinions was reminiscent of Stalin's tactics at their harshest.Basically, the rapid demise of the group was largely the WUO's own fault. The entire enterprise and the political analysis upon which it was based was fatally flawed and utterly superficial. The group's strategy was hopelessly naive. Some glimmer of insight into these matters was revealed in the interviews former members granted the author, though some true believers still (David Gilbert, especially) criticize tactics rather than strategy. The book concludes with a section on \"Lessons and Legacies\" and an Epilogue featuring a prison visitation vignette between the still incarcerated Gilbert and the author.In \"Outlaws\", Berger makes no effort whatsoever to strive for objectivity. In fact, he is quite unabashed in his expressions of sympathy for \"the Cause\". Berger is generally unquestioning in his carte blanche acceptance of various contemporary fringe \"liberation\" groups, asserting that, as one example, the Black Liberation Army was a legitimate political \"vanguard\". Even such preposterous cults as MOVE are elevated to Olympian revolutionary heights. Worse, Berger ignores the prominent criminal element in the Black Panthers and other contemporary separatist groups. Berger, like the subjects of his book, unabashedly believes that the U.S. is an \"imperialist\" power and that the Cuban regime and even Hugo Chavez's \"Bolivarian\" dictatorship (amongst others) are progressive, honest expressions of their peoples' aspirations. Curious in its total absence from the book is any mention of the then-contemporary Palestinian armed factions. Even more bizarre, despite reference to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Berger alludes to but does not address the obvious question of whether or not the viciously fundamentalist Islamist movements are \"legitimate\" national liberation movements.Berger, along with the WUO, seem incapable of sufficient introspection and political insight to grasp the concept that, as the French Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser once wrote, \"Ideology is the imaginary relationship people have with the real conditions of their existence.\" The blinding effects of ideology were evident throughout the book. Despite the manifest failure of \"Old Left\" regimes in the USSR, China and elsewhere, WUO came to espouse Old Left ideas. For example, despite the transparently obvious and accumulating evidence and ignoring compelling insights on the issue from C. Wright Mills and others on the new structure of American power, they emphasized class struggle. Despite evidence that \"class interests\" absolutely did not trump self-interest,they failed to adjust their approach from appeals to revolutionary solidarity (to class, against \"imperialism\", to the Third World) to \"what can the Revolution do for me, personally?\" Despite the fact that most Americans, once the Vietnam War (and the draft) had ended no longer cared for \"revolution\", and that \"revolutionary action theater\" would not be \"the spark that starts a prairie fire\", they continued to conceive of themselves as an elite Revolutionary vanguard. Finally, they failed to articulate a final goal short of \"socialism\". All these mistakes rendered the group increasingly marginal in its appeal, domestically and in the \"Third World\". The WUO was seemingly \"dazed and confused\" throughout the brief period of its existence. In modern parlance, in an effort to remain relevant, the group justified its continued efforts by \"mission-creep\". Incoherence in ideology, strategy, group structure, interpersonal relations and numerous other areas is the salient problem set that Berger does make explicit.One issue addressed in some detail by Berger does deserve commendation and that is the deplorable and outrageous incarceration policies first implemented in the Sixties and now in full deployment. The \"privatization\" of prisons and the public adulation of such perverted law enforcement agencies as the Maricopa County (Arizona) Sheriff's Department is a shameful chapter in American history, as are the accompanying criminalization of a wide spectrum of victimless crimes, draconian sentencing \"guidelines\", racist incarceration policies, imprisoning children and lack of inmate \"rehabilitation\" programs. It is probably also true, as Berger asserts, that prisoners such as Gilbert are paying the price for the entire movement. This is a heavy burden for men such as Gilbert but, to his great credit, he remains committed to his ideals (whether you agree with them or not), having tempered them by years of introspection, self-criticism and contemplation.I would be remiss in failing to point out one other, at this point minor, problem with the book: Berger mis-attributes the \"foco\" theory of revolution to Regis Debray, rather than to its actual author, Che Guevara. This approach to initiating revolution in a Third World society worked in Cuba; it was manifestly unsuccessful in Bolivia and in The Congo, a mistake Che paid for with his life.So, Berger asks, Why did the WUO rise to such prominence and what is its legacy? Given the zeitgeist of the 1960s with the vastly unpopular Vietnam War, the draft, racial tensions and the rise of the counter-culture\", a real sense of radical social change appeared in the offing. Romantic revolutionaries such as the self-denying and photogenic Che captured the imagination of the student movement. WUO rode on the coattails of this phenomenon. By promoting their \"outlaw\" image, they usurped the role previously occupied by Ho, Che, Fidel and Mao as avatars of Revolution. At the time, it was easy to accept all of that since, after all, the life of privileged white students could be rudely interrupted by a sojourn in a leech-infested rice paddy.The really perplexing aspect of all this is the return to \"above ground\" society by the WUO leaders themselves. After making reputations based on the denial of \"white privilege\", they were damn quick to exercise that same privilege in their post-revolutionary careers. This is an irony apparently lost on both them and Berger, as well.",

        "Title": "threatening anthropology mccarthyism and the fbirsquos surveillance of activist anthropologists",
        "description": "A vital reminder of the importance of academic freedom, Threatening Anthropology offers a meticulously detailed account of how U.S. Cold War surveillance damaged the field of anthropology. David H. Price reveals how dozens of activist anthropologists were publicly and privately persecuted during the Red Scares of the 1940s and 1950s. He shows that it was not Communist Party membership or Marxist beliefs that attracted the most intense scrutiny from the fbi and congressional committees but rather social activism, particularly for racial justice. Demonstrating that the fbi's focus on anthropologists lessened as activist work and Marxist analysis in the field tapered off, Price argues that the impact of McCarthyism on anthropology extended far beyond the lives of those who lost their jobs. Its messages of fear and censorship had a pervasive chilling effect on anthropological investigation. As critiques that might attract government attention were abandoned, scholarship was curtailed. Price draws on extensive archival research including correspondence, oral histories, published sources, court hearings, and more than 30,000 pages of fbi and government memorandums released to him under the Freedom of Information Act. He describes government monitoring of activism and leftist thought on college campuses, the surveillance of specific anthropologists, and the disturbing failure of the academic community-including the American Anthropological Association-to challenge the witch hunts. Today the \"war on terror\" is invoked to license the government's renewed monitoring of academic work, and it is increasingly difficult for researchers to access government documents, as Price reveals in the appendix describing his wrangling with Freedom of Information Act requests. A disquieting chronicle of censorship and its consequences in the past, Threatening Anthropology is an impassioned cautionary tale for the present.",

Price gathered a lot of new documents and information and his analysis left me thinking in new ways about McCarthyism and how the FBI was used to enforce racist policies in the 1940s and 1950s. Price uses thousands of documents to show that the FBI was used to persecute pioneering scientists threatening widespread bigotry.Threatening Anthropology is a consuming, thought provoking book. Because there is a lot of dense information I thought I would slowly work my way through this over three or four weeks, but the writing and subject matter pulled me right in and I read it in a few days like I would a well written novel. Price really brings the reader into the story by richly describing the historical setting and then delving into dozens of individual stories telling how several dozen anthropologists like Melville Jacobs, Richard Morgan, Gene Weltfish, Ashley Montague and Margaret Mead were followed and harassed by the FBI because their fights for equality was seen as some sort of foreign communist plot. Price uses extensive FBI documents and correspondence to establish this story and brings an anthropological perspective that made me rethink what McCarthyism was.I used to wonder if the McCarthy like witch trials could happen again, and Price's detailed analysis and current political developments leave no doubts in my mind that we could do this again very quickly. This book has a lot to say to us all today and deserves to be read by anyone concerned about the abuses of the FBI, CIA and Homeland Security in the war on terrorism, and the past examined here looks a lot like the present. As Price says in the final pages of his book, \"Today, much as in the past, free thought, civil liberties and academic freedom are curtailed under conditions of fear as America appears to be preparing for another lengthy ill-defined war.\" But Price doesn't leave us there, he gives us hope by analyzing past defenses against McCarthyism for us to use in the present.",

This is a rare book that is carefully written for a board public readership, yet is so thoroughly researched and footnoted that historians and other scholars will find this to be an important contribution.This book will send shockwaves through the anthropological community. It should lead anthropology's historians to rethink their silence on the events documented here. How can it be that we learn so late that so many anthropologists from Franz Boas until now have been tormented by FBI spies? Have others known of these events and remained so silent for so long?While I studied anthropology during the decades discussed in this book I had no idea that my colleagues suffered the attacks detailed here, but I felt the pressures to avoid controversial advocacy that are documented here.

                "review/text": "Few books can affect a reader so profoundly as this one has me. Price's book has received accolades -- \"destined to become a classic,\" and \"belongs on anyone's shelf.\" I wandered into the pages and, to my surprise and relief, found myself revisiting the underside of what I thought I had observed all along. Names were named, some of them among real live faculties I had known. I experienced a personal Eureka! when I learned that Jacobs and Stern, authors of that Barnes and Noble introduction to anthropology that I read in my formative years, had both been blacklisted. Now I must read that old paperback again and retrace where my interests might have started off in naive directions. I look forward to this self-study in self-censorship for the postmodern age.I was overjoyed that Price did not stop with the accepted, formalized \"end\" of McCarthyism, but rather explained the brief re-emergence of relative \"academic freedom\" through much of the '60s-'70s and '80s, and the more sophisticated, perhaps more dangerous downward spiral today. The book helps those of us who entered college at a time when Ashley Montagu, Kathleen Gough and so many others were in the news over issues other than their research. Price has prepared a thoroughgoing catalogue of official harassment targeting scholars who operated on now-popularly-accepted assumptions of global human worth and equality.The paradox is that, while anthropology has to rely on those assumptions if it is to operate as a field of intellectual endeavor, our audience -- any public -- does not, but they pay us anyway. Popular reactions to most anthropological contributions range from wonder to outrage. Anyone with basic grounding in anthropology would probably tell you that the field has always pushed the limits of acceptance within host countries, most of which have been main players of Western industrial civilization.As with the job interview, it is always important to understand who holds the purse strings. Western anthropologists have long pushed the limits of societal acceptance, and that has always had consequnces. Today's \"globalization\" of anthropology finds many individuals from societies that were traditionally the subjects of anthropological study, pushing those limits from new and refreshing directions, and, of course, the resulting consequences are also \"globalizing.\"We are such good people; why are we then so villified? Tired old explanations of \"cultural lag\", ethnocentrism, and differing viewpoints still work. But Price's contribution is a detailed catalog-summary with specific cases showing particularly what makes the United States Government antsy about anthropology. Until \"Threatening Anthropology,\" no one source discussed in context the prevailing governmental assumptions, and the various selected facts, political spins and, yes, myths on which government agencies often rely for those assumptions. Our tired, old explanations have finally got some help, as someone focused on the intersections between anthropology and host society as they are expressed in the United States.I have recollections from my own past when, during euphoric rushes of \"academic freedom,\" I presumed to speak from an anthropological perspective in ways that might draw the attention of, say, the FBI. Many of these run perilously close to Price's examples. One still wonders, but at the same time one has a grander perspective on why offers have not poured in from academia.Price's volume is indeed chilling. The prevailing situation within anthropology since well before Boas has been chilling. I keep in mind the smaller-scale analogy of covert ostracism on a band or tribal level. At least within our society there are other avenues of endeavor, and we can retain a view of that old anthropolgy \"avenue\" and see what's happening and what has happened to our former colleagues.Price does rather well with his conclusions. I am in some agreement with him over postmodernism insofar as many of its adherents appear to encourage the view that anthropology is only a part of Western science, and that as such it cannot do justice to any cross cultural perspective. Postmodernism in its \"deconstruction\" of positivism does appear to feed the late 20th century and continuing vogue for discounting what Mooney (The Republican War on Science) calls the \"fact-based\" perspective as irrelevant for today's policy-making. Such a notion would have frustrated Philleo Nash. I know it gets a double-take from me.I also agree whole-heartedly that organizations like the American Anthropological Association would do well to treat future governmental meddling with individual scholars' employment -- present and future versions of McCarthyism -- with less timidity. All organizations need a clear understanding of just what constituties grounds for employee discipline, and they need to know that other power centers back them up.Last time around the witch hunts came and went, leaving lasting scars. The issues are lively, and generate shouting-matches to this day. It was a political choice for organizations to remain in the background as \"apolitical.\" It would be no more a political choice to stand behind individual anthropologists and help them make reasonable stands should they find themselves going against those big guns.",

I won't repeat the points made by others that Professor Price's work has clear political applications in the present day in academia generally. What I found engrossing was a side of anthropology which rarely or never emerged in my university courses, particularly in those which brought up sociology and anthropology's relation to literature (my own area of study). In the seminars hermeneutics was the focus and the specific emphasis was on signification cross-culturally. I think students (or at least I) got the impression that anthropology was indeed, as Professor Price notes, a science which shuns cultural hierarchies, but that technique was the crux of the authorial problem and that philosophies informing how these techniques came about were in second place. This isn't to say that the committments and philosophies of anthropologists could somehow be subordinated to the idea of the true text, but that an objectivity separate from ideology was, if not possible, at least desired.I can't remember whether I thought this was reasonable at the time, but in retrospect I see that my notions of how the anthropologist goes about her or his work was certainly limited. This book inspires me to read more in the history of this field and to go to the primary texts which the author provides in such rich abundance.",

Prior to Price, historians such as George Stocking have taken an apolitical view of anthropology's history. This is unfortunate in large part because many founding members of the discipline were politically active and engaged. The anthropologists paid a heavy price for this political activism--a point that Price drives home effectively. Encyclopedic in approach, Price does a great job outlining how politically active anthropologists were persecuted and lost their jobs--while the American Anthropology Associaltion looked on and did nothing. Based on extensive research via the FOIA, Price is to be commended for his efforts. While Price has focused on the larger issue of the Cold War, for those who want a case study see William Peace's biography of Leslie A. White. Hopefull the work of Peace and Price will inspire other anthropologists to take a closer look at the history of anthropology. Taken together, Price's and Peace's work will signal a new era in writing about anthropology's past.",

        "description": "From the ashes of World War II to the conflict over Iraq, William Hitchcock examines the miraculous transformation of Europe from a deeply fractured land to a continent striving for stability, tolerance, democracy, and prosperity. Exploring the role of Cold War politics in Europe's peace settlement and the half century that followed, Hitchcock reveals how leaders such as Charles de Gaulle, Willy Brandt, and Margaret Thatcher balanced their nations' interests against the demands of the reigning superpowers, leading to great strides in economic and political unity. He re-creates Europeans' struggles with their troubling legacy of racial, ethnic, and national antagonism, and shows that while divisions persist, Europe stands on the threshold of changes that may profoundly shape the future of world affairs.",

                "review/text": "When Chester Wilmot, an Oxbridge graduate and a reporter for an English newspaper, was sifting through the war records at Nuremburg during the war trials, it donned on him that all the material the Allies needed to determine whether their D-Day strategy worked was in his hands. When he became a don at Oxford (I believe), he did just that. He poured over signal records captured from the Germans, historical data from the Allies, and produced a marvelous account of what the Allies did on D-Day and why it worked. The fact that Wilmot was on foot as a correspondent with the first British landing parties on D-Day only adds to the vision and understanding in, and the reader's appreciation of, this story. You'll end up wanting more. My wife and I visited Normandy on an excursion in the Summer of 1994, one week to the day after the 50th D-Day anniversary stuff ended. The crowds were gone but all the sites and history were still there. We stayed in a chateaux in a village called Audrieu and, in preparation for the trip, wanted to read a D-Day history. I'd read the Longest Day and seen the movie, but wanted something more and different. A colleague merely remarked, flatly, &quot;it's the *best* book ever written on the subject.&quot; Wilmot didn't fail me. His ability to describe the macro troop movements and supply considerations, while at the same time describing in some cases every turn in the road, every hiding spot, and every skirmish, proved to me his ability as a great story-teller and historian. Even my wife, who was on the trip only because it was to France, and who originally had little interest in the region or D-Day, was smitten by the descriptions. She picked up the book while I was swimming in the Chateaux's pool early one morning, and it couldn't be pried loose until she was done. My wife was struck by the uncanny ability of Wilmot to describe a location or a battle or a situation from a hilltop, or vista point - along with a reference to a mile marker or other memorial so today's reader may find the same view, and witness what it is Wilmot is talking about. When one does this, as we did frequently, the book comes alive in the reader's hands more than any other first person history I have read. Wilmot's book is a masterpiece. Americans will read it and enjoy it because of its slightly skewed view for all of us - it's written from the British perspective most decidedly - and is unyielding in its frank comparisons of fresh but unskilled American troops, compared with their experienced, weary British colleagues. The book will stand out as an icon of its genre to anyone who reads it - and to those who accompany the tome to Normandy, it will make for a lifelong memory. Its ability to enhance a journey to Normandy cannot be overstated. Copyright TAStone 1997.",

Wilmot covers all of the war in Europe, including Dunkirk, Dieppe, Battle of/Invasion of Britain,etc but is especially in his element post D-Day. He puts a lot of things in context- e.g. land force successes are related to the strategic ability of Germany to wage war following the strategic bombing of German factories etc., which in turn is put into the context of an air war, and other factors pertaining to output. Yes, German output of materi&eacute;l was increasing at the end of the war...For me, the best thing is that Chester WIlmot was, I believe, a New Zealander. He is therefore a lot more objective in his work than you find in many of the distorted and jignoistic books on the topic, where you expect John Wayne to arrive at any minute and nothing goes wrong. The Allies DID make mistakes. It wasnt all glorious, and he reflects this, whilst giving credit where it is due and putting reverses into proper context. For example, his analysis of Omaha beach and the inadequacies of US higher command that led to it is very moving; and he pulls no punches with e.g. Operation Market Garden either. Further, the political struggles within the allies are as well represented as the struggle against Nazi Germany itself: Finally, after reading Wilmot, you are left in no doubt that the fighting in Western Europe after D-Day was every bit as bitter and devastating as the fighting in the first world war, and with equally horrific casualties.A must have book. I have been trying to track one down for years. I eventually found a well-used 1950s copy in a second hand book shop, and I would love another hard back version, but will settle for a paperback in the interim.BUY THIS BOOK!!",

                "review/text": "Chester Wilmot was uniquely qualified to write this exhaustive history. He was a war correspondent who made the jump on June 6, so in some ways his narrative of D-Day's opening is a memoir, a trained historian and an exhaustive researcher. This book occupied him for six years and even though it was published in 1952, it was and still is, a remarkably objective history of the war in Europe.First, the flaws. It's not complete. There's no account on the fall of France or Poland or Norway for that matter. It opens when the Germans have the BEF trapped in the channel ports in May 1940. But this is understandable. Wilmot's assertion that Hitler's letting the BEF get away sowed the the seeds for it's eventual return to the continent. Second, the Russian Front (which actually WON the war in Europe by the way) is dealt with only summarily and the Pacific is only discussed in terms of overall Grand Strategy. He also only mentions the war in the Mediterranean in passing. His Cold War conclusions were off as well, but this is said of course with hindsight. But considering when this was published (1952 originally), it's understandable for Wilmot for feeling that way.The strengths of this book is that if you want a first rate narrative of the whats, the hows and the whys on how the War in Western Europe was fought, then this is the book.Wilmot covers every possible aspect of the Western European campaign. From grand strategy, to desperate battles to blunders committed on both sides.American readers might be peeved the way Wilmot praises Montgomery and not enough flattering comments are given Eisenhower and Patton (though both do receive their share). Frankly, I think it's high time Monty gets some good recognition over here. You don't become a Field Marshal in any Army by being incompetent. He was a good general, maybe even a great one. He gave the British Army its first real victory over the Germans, something no other British general had yet to do.Wilmot also discusses the political machinations of both sides. The Allies were far superior to Hitler when it came to this. Also he discusses the economics of the war; something few if any military historians did at the time. Today, it's a common practice, but in 1952, it was a radical new approach.John Keegan's recommendation of this in his history of the Second World War got me to purchasing a copy. He still believes it's unsurpassed in many ways. I have to agree.I don't agree with everything Wilmot said, but I think that's what makes a good history book. You have points to debate and discuss. After all, history is always interpretive.",

It is from June 6th that this book really shines and shows the war in the west in a farily fine-grained manner.Wilmot, being an Australian, was somewhat baised and favorable in his treatment of MOnty. This aside, he does present an impartial treatment of the war in the west. As he was actually there (I believe), he had access to primary sources that make this a highly valuable and valid work. He doesn't glorify war or the allied efforts and the closing remark about the cost of war and hoping it never happens again is quite good.

The fall of Austria, Czechkoslovakia, Poland and France are all omitted. Germany's invasion plans, Operation: Sealion are what the reader is introduced with. The history continues with a detail scrutiny of the political, diplomatic and military moves (with an emphasis on the latter) that made up the struggle for Europe. The book ends with a history of the blunders at the Yalta conference and hints at the continuing tension that would mark post-war Europe.Why You Should Read This Book:Wilmot, in my humble opinion, gave an objective account of the war. He was not afraid to point out some of the blunders that the allies made in the course of the war. Some critics, Americans especially might disagree because he was highly critical of Patton and Eisenhower, while Montgomery was praised as a military genius. Indeed there might be some error by Wilmot in not giving an account of Chamberlain and his policy of appeasement. However this omission does not detract from the power of this history. This book gives the details to arguably the greatest conflict of mankind. With the generation that fought that war slowly dying away, it is important to revisit this war and not forget the lessons that history has taught us.What you should expect to see in this book:Expect a very detailed and at often times dry account of military plans, logistics, etc. The maps in here are of great use in understanding the war.What you should not expect to see in this book:This book is mainly a military history, so don't expect to read about the holocaust or about the Nazi philosophy. There are many good books on those subjects, but this is not one of them (I would highly suggest The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich by Shirer if you want to learn about the Nazis). Also, do not expect a lot of history before the battle of Britain. In addition this book was written at a time when information about the Eastern front mainly came from Nazi archives and not the Soviets. If you're looking for a book on Stalingrad or Kursk, this is probably not it (the author does cover these battles in detail, but modern books have been able to access more resources in describing them).I gave this book 4 stars because I only give 5 stars to masterpieces. This book is certainly a thumbs up.",

Of all the books about the second world war I read since, this work fulfil the thirst for knowledge I have regarding many aspects of that war, like logistic, war materiel production, and the effects of scientific discoveries on the outcome. The author writing is very fluid, not repetive in its description and straight forward. He doesnt hesitate to lay blames where due, and praises when warranted, neutral as he should be. I very much appreciate the battle situations maps, being in color they are easier to read and visualize the operation at hand. Appendix B: The High Commands is most useful when it comes to evaluate the reasons behind some of the crucial decisions that were taken. On the other hand, I find the author cursory writing about such momentous events as the North African and Italian campaings somewhat disconcerting, being much too short and lacking in depth, given the impact those campaings had on the german ressources. Seems obvious that the author was not prepared to go in more details, having probably not researched those two campaings to his satisfaction in order to elaborate further.

It's a dry book but from the point of view of the battles and command structures it has probably got to be one of the best books on war that I've read. It's the sort of book that War Colleges would recommend for professional military students to study - professional, logical and perfectly representative of command, control and communications in major war. There are no personal vignettes, no rhetorical and ethical questioning of the meaning of war etc. The account of D-Day to the end of the war in the West is in itself a sobering exercise. However, if I could quibble it would be to point out that it should be entitled &quot;The Struggle for Western Europe&quot; and that on the land. The Eastern Front is almost entirely neglected, as is Italy, the sea war, the air war which were all contemporaneous with the land battle in the west. But this is a small failing with the grinding industrial quality which is the unfortunate fact of modern war. It doesn't stop to mourn the dead (that comes later) and nor does Chester Wilmot.

His 740-page The Hidden Hand is preceded by Stephen Dorrill's MI6 and several works by Christopher Andrew and some of Andrew's co-authors; he credits both Dorrill and Andrew for their support for his own project.Aldrich tries to debunk some of the myths that are carried from one U.K. published espionage history to another - none more prevalent than that Harold Adrian Philby's betrayals destroyed much of the MI6 and CIA/OPC covert and often fatal dispatching of East Bloc exiles to do political mischief in their homelands, such as driving Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha to history's ashheap. By Aldrich's brief light, Philby was too important a spy for the KGB to allow him to be much involved in secret shoot-'em-ups. While it is to his credit for not totally swallowing the British - and too often American - myth about Philby, he misses some important details that grew the Philby legend; did Burgess truly courier Philby's purloined top secret papers to KGB case officers in New York City?One overall element that bothered this writer is Aldrich's themantic approach. Too often a reader has to overuse the index to maintain one thread or another coherently. That is not to say the book is badly written, for it is not; rather it is merely inconvenient. In fact, there was little if any of the obvious mistakes that gatherers of huge volumes of factoids too often make. Finally, for this American, there is reason to credit Aldrich for his obviously huge amount of research effort. One must assume that he visited such backwater American presidential archives as the Truman Library at Independence, Missouri, and its even more isolated neighbor, the Eisenhower Library at Abilene, Kansas.With both the British and American governments moving to release ever more Cold War era documents, there seems a certainty that more volumes on the fascinating 1950s West-East faceoff will surely be turned out. One can only hope that the myths that make up the history of Cold War intelligence 60 years after its beginning will one day be debunked by an availablity of solid evidence rather than merely by an author's guesswork.",

For, as it casts its view back, beginning with a chapter on Native Americans, ?The Original Peacemakers,? it finds some measured reasons for hope.As might be expected, the book does undertake some ?deconstruction.? It asks us to question the ?myth of redemptive violence,? which its authors and others, notably Walter Wink, claim is the lens through which most Americans, academics and other citizens alike, view their own history. According to this myth, Americans are essentially nonviolent but sometimes, reluctantly, have to resort to it to bring about some overriding common good. According to Juhnke and Hunter, however, this is an unnecessarily ?deterministic interpretation of history?; it not only undervalues the role individual and institutional choice have played in the past but also keeps us from looking for peaceable solutions in the future.Their task being reconstructive as well as deconstructive, Juhnke and Hunter examine such solutions in the past. For example, they point out that ?Americans are remarkably well informed of the details of the Boston Tea Party of December 17,1773, while we are quite ignorant about the success of the people in Philadelphia who at the same time were nonviolently persuading the British captain to take the East India tea back to England.?The authors also examine examples of how wars have been averted, ?as in 1799 when President John Adams moved to end the ?Quasi-War? with France and in 1807 when President Thomas Jefferson avoided war with England by a strategy of economic embargo.? The search for peaceful solutions in our history has not been limited to a few romantic idealists, Juhnke and Hunter assert.On the other hand, we need to credit the influence idealists often do have. To cite a more recent example, ?Americans need to reexamine the notion that President Ronald Reagan brought about the end of the nuclear arms race with his hard-line rhetoric and military build-up of 1981-85. We need to take account of the decisive influence of peace-minded anti-nuclear scientists, especially Andrei Sakharov, upon Soviet leader Michael Gorbachev to take dramatic and unilateral disproportional steps toward disarmament.?Issues and events in this book are treated chronologically. In addition to the topics referred to above, chapters deal with the anti-slavery movement, the civil war, reconstruction, rights of women and workers, world wars 1 and 2, civil rights, the cold war, and ecology.The college teachers who wrote this book undoubtedly hoped it would find its way into American history classrooms; its chapters are generously footnoted. This should not deter more general readers such as myself, however, for their writing style is clear and unclogged by academic jargon; moreover, as they move through history, they provide enough detail so that their argument can be followed by a reader relatively unfamiliar with the events, issues, and movements they discuss. Carol Hunter teaches at Earlham College in Indiana, and James Juhnke has recently retired from Bethel College in Kansas; with their Quaker and Mennonite affiliations, both Christian liberal arts colleges have a longstanding and vibrant peace tradition.",

                "review/text": "Wartime is the WWII memoir of the great Yugoslav dissident, Milovan Djilas. A leading prewar Communist activist and a high ranking member of the Yugoslav Communist leadership after the war, Djilas was expelled from the party and imprisoned (in the same prison where he had been jailed by the pre-war dictatorship) for his dissident opinions. During WWII, Djilas was a leading figure in the Communist (Partisan) resistance and participated in many of the major events following the German conquest of Yugoslavia. Written many years after the war, this is no panegyric but rather a stark and honest accounting enriched by Djilas' mature reflections on the outcome of the war and the subsequent development of an authoritarian Communist state in Yugoslavia.Wartime has several striking features. Violent death is a constant companion. Hardly a page goes by without a death or mention of someone who dies in the course of the war. While the Partisans did fight the Germans and Italian occupiers, most of the combat described in Wartime is fratricidal. Christians versus Muslims, Croats versus Serbs, Serbian (Royalist) Chetniks versus Serbian Partisans, ethnic Germans versus everyone else. In Djilas' description of war in his native Montenegro, its implicit that conflict followed the contours of traditional clan rivalries. The Partisan leadership were convinced Communists, though the intellectual Djilas was perhaps the only real student of Marx. Ideology mattered greatly to them. While the leadership tended to be drawn from the more educated strate of Yugoslav life and somewhat educated industrial workers like Tito, the mass of the Partisan armies were poorly educated peasants. This gives rise to incongruous features. An army led by avowed Marxist revolutionaries carries Orthodox priests on its staff and major celebrations include recitation of traditional folk epics featuring bandits and the struggle against the Ottomans.Djilas was a gifted writer. The often horrifying events in Wartime are presented in a matter of fact, quotidian manner that only emphasizes the grim nature of Yugoslavian life during the war. Djilas has a talent for the revealing anecdote and concise description of character. Djilas periodically interrupts his narrative to make rhetorically powerful statements about the nature of the events described. For example, of his native Montenegro he writes. \"...Montenegro, where, from time immemorial, ideas found consumation in violence...\"In its way, this book is a masterpiece.",

        "description": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER -> \"This is Jeff Shaara at his best, giving us another superb [and] historically grounded novel of one of the most dramatic struggles of World War II.\"-George McGovern Utilizing the voices of the conflict's most heroic figures, some immortal and some unknown, Jeff Shaara tells the story of America's pivotal role in World War II: fighting to hold back the Japanese conquest of the Pacific while standing side-by-side with her British ally, the last hope for turning the tide of the war against Germany. As British and American forces strike into the soft underbelly of Hitler's Fortress Europa, the new weapons of war come clearly into focus. In North Africa, tank battles unfold in a tapestry of dust and fire unlike any the world has ever seen. In Sicily, the Allies attack their enemy with a barely tested weapon: the paratrooper. As battles rage along the coasts of the Mediterranean, the momentum of the war begins to shift, setting the stage for the Battle of Normandy. The first book in a trilogy about the military conflict that defined thetwentieth century, The Rising Tide is an unprecedented and intimate portrait of those who waged this astonishing global war.

                "review/text": "In his (now regrettably past) prime, W.E.B. Griffin concocted wonderful war adventures from blending real people and events with fictional characters and circumstances. Jeff Shaara has gone miles beyond Griffin in taking real people, real events, adding just a bit of imagination and turning actual history into great fiction. Truly great fiction.\"The Rising Tide\" is the first of a planned trilogy about WWII. For the first few pages, I wondered where Shaara was going. It was more on the order a well written history text. Then it segued to Rommell in the desert . . . and then it dawned on me.Shaara is bringing us into a part of the lives of Rommel, Eisenhower, Patton, Montgomery, Bradley and ordinary soldiers that we can't touch: the internal happenings of their minds. Shaara's goal is audacious and his success breathtaking.Most of Shaara's words are spent on the leaders, like Rommell and Eisenhower. Good move: Shaara is able to provide the big picture, the sweep and scope of the war. In less competent hands, I doubt that it would work. But Shaara makes it seem real. The frustrations of Rommel, faced with a deteriorating situation in Africa, the jealousy of other German generals, the incompetence of the Italian leadership, the increasingly delusional Hitler and his own declining health. Shaara puts you in Rommel's mind, so to speak, and he does it well.The same holds true for Eisenhower, as yet untested as the leader of a never before attempted coalition. Eisenhower is not sure of his own capabilities, but he has virtually no one to confide his fears in. Shaara makes leadership the lonely place it is.Without spoiling it for the reader, it is difficult to convey Shaara's triumph. To those familiar with WWII history, particularly the North African campaigns, virtually every event in Shaara's book will be known. Shaara wisely balances the big-time players like Eisenhower with some smaller fry, specifically two American soldiers. It's an impressive and very effective technique.For those readers who are not overly familiar with the period, it's a painless and entertaining way to open a window on history.Shaara has done something truly unique here and he's done it superlatively well. WWII history afficiandos and those simply interested in a solid war adventure will find it fascinating. I'm impatiently looking forward to the next two volumes.Jerry",

                "review/text": "Jeff Shaara's The Rising Tide is the first of a projected trilogy on World War II. Those familiar with his other works--such as his Civil War novels, Gods and Generals and The Last Full Measure, his Revolutionary War and Mexican War works--will recognize the technique here. Shaara picks a handful of characters and uses their experiences to create the forward movement of his works.In The Rising Tide, the key characters whose views are used to create the narrative include George Patton, Dwight Eisenhower, Erwin Rommel (\"The Desert Fox\"), Albert Kesselring, and a couple American soldiers, Jack Logan and Jesse Adams. The advantage of this is that you see the role of individuals, from different perspectives in a series of military engagements. This provides a certain richness of texture to the novel. On the other hand, there are limits to this. The reader does not get a bird's eye view of the action. All is through the eyes of specific individuals grounded in very specific circumstances. This works well enough, of course, but things can get left out.The novel begins with Rommel's combat against the English in North Africa and his ability to win against long odds. However, the weight on British and then British and American troops is too much, as his army cannot receive enough gasoline, replacement troops and tanks , and so on to compete effectively. After the allies defeat the German and Italian forces in North Africa, the action of the novel moves to Sicily, where the hard fought campaign is described well. The conclusion of the novel points to the nasty Italian campaign and the early days of organizing the invasion of France.The reader is left looking forward to the next volume in this series. While the structure of Shaara's novel has lost its novelty, it can still be effective as a story telling device.",

Earlier works included spectacular depictions of the Civil War and eloquent portrayals of World War I. Like many of you, I did not think there was anything more to learn about World War II - due to countless movies and books on the subject. I was wrong.The author manages to grab the reader's attention through an invigorating mix of key players. I encountered the usual suspects, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Winston Churchill, etc. However, I was captivated by an interesting assortment of obscure characters - which brought texture, warmth, and appeal, to this exceptional read.The chapter on Erwin Romnel (sometimes called \"Desert Fox\") kept me riveted. It had more action, suspense, and adventure than a James Bond movie! In the foreword, the author states his goal is to find a few voices, tell the story through their eyes, and put the reader in the same room. I visited that room, met some exceptional people, and had a memorable time. I encourage you to do the same.Reggie Johnson, Success-Tapes.Com",

I have plowed through about two-thirds of it and just given up, as much as I wanted to like it I just can't take the time to go on.For me, this book fails on several levels. Shaara tries to tell the \"big picture\" and \"small picture\" stories by switching points of view between historical and fictional protagonists, but the brief vingnettes with the fictional characters left me unable to know or care much about them.The historical characters are poorly rendererd cardbord cutouts. I realized part way through that the dialogue attributed to each man is indistinguishable in vocabulary, diction, and tone from each other. There is no sense of Eisenhower's optimism, Patton's fire, Rommel's leadership or Marshall's gravitas. All of them, in the book, speak in contemporay (and I mean currrent contemporary) slang. I realize that general officers sometimes address each other by first name in private, but I don't believe ANYONE ever addressed Marshall as \"George\"...and Marshall addressed Eisenhower as \"Eisenhower\" and never as \"Ike\" as Shaara has him doing.By the way, there is an author's warning about the language in the book. It's limited to everybody saying \"damnned\" a whole damnned lot - from George Marshall (who seldom, if ever, used any sort of profanity) to George Patton (who was famous for his foul tounge, and was a much more creative cusser then using one mild expletive continuously).The research seems to be correct in the large but superficial. The author refers to equpment (armored trucks) that did not exist in the U.S. Army inventory in 1942, and there are numerous small factual errors - for example American tanks are referred to as \"more compact\" then German ones - when in fact the high profile of US armor was a disadvantage compared to German armor.In short, if you know anything about WWII history already, you will not enjoy the book because of the inaccurate characterization of historical figures that you already know and numerous niggling factual errors. If you aren't knowlegeable about WWII history, you will get tired of the cookie-cutter characters and won't care much about the fictional ones.The story of a green U.S. Army facing the veteran German army and losing it's first battle (Kasserine Pass) and then recovering to win victory after victory over the nazis is a great one. It deserves better than this novel. Your time and money would be better spent with history - like Stephen Ambrose, Cornelius Ryan or Charles B. Macdonald to name a few.",

The author fictionalizes the thoughts and conversations of historical figures like Rommel and Eisenhower plus he adds a few fictitious characters to round out the story. It is well done but the characters do not have the depth of the WEB Griffin characters or those of Herman Wouk in his novelsThe Winds of WarandWar and Remembrance. Both Griffin and Wouk use minor characters to tell the story and make much less of an attempt to present the thinking of the historical figures. I think both Wouk and Griffin draw better and deeper characters although I understand some of the impatience readers have with recent Griffin books. The early Griffin series about Army Aviation and about the Marine Corps in World War II are better novels with fully rounded characters. Wouk's characters are the work of a master. Tom Clancy writes less in a historical genre although his novels are written for the same readers.Having said that, this is a good novel with lots of detail that, having read a lot of history about this period, sounds accurate to me. For someone who knows less of the history and wants to learn it, this would be an excellent read.

The latter described the US Army's experience in North Africa during World War 2. Shaara's book is also mostly about the same theatre, though it also ventures into the subsequent Italian campaign. For Shaara's fans, the format of the book will be quite familiar. There is the rendition of fictional dialogue by historical figures; in this case Patton, Eisenhower and Rommel. Plus a smattering of purely fictional, low ranking characters. Here, a tanker and a paratrooper.As usual, Shaara has performed impressive research. So that when a well known historical figure makes some remark, you can be confident that even though it may be fictional, it is consistent with what actually transpired. Plus, the narrative shows many of the difficulties encountered in the field. Something that standard history texts might not sufficiently portray.However it has to be said that the book is like his others in this regard. Barely more than a pure non-fiction historical treatise. The overwhelming focus is the actual events. The fictional characters are little other than cardboard. None are truly memorable. One could reasonably say that the narrative is essentially non-fiction.You disagree? Here is another take. Do you read science fiction? A common and accurate criticism of much science fiction is that the idea (usually technology oriented) is the true hero of the story. Any human characters are often just window dressing, to buttress the idea. If you can recognise that in science fiction, so too with Shaara's books.Still disagree? There have been some memorable novels set in World War 2. \"Winds of War\" by Herman Wouk, and \"From Here to Eternity\" by James Jones, for example. Written in the 1960s, these are now generally considered classic. The characters are far more fully fleshed and thus likelier to remain in your memory long after you have read the books. Yes, you can be a fan of Shaara. But you should still also see that he has never produced anything as comparable.",

Then the action leaps to Sicily where Patton takes center stage and adds to his illustrious reputation. I loved how the action and history propels you through the pages. The characters literally jump off the page at you and you become to know them so well. Interesting in how the story weaves back from the Allied point of view and the German point of view. Highly recommended.",

        "description": "The course of daily life in the United States has been a product of tradition, environment, and circumstance. How did the Civil War alter the lives of women, both white and black, left alone on southern farms? How did the Great Depression change the lives of working class families in eastern cities? How did the discovery of gold in California transform the lives of native American, Hispanic, and white communities in western territories? Organized by time period as spelled out in the National Standards for U.S. History, these four volumes effectively analyze the diverse whole of American experience, examining the domestic, economic, intellectual, material, political, recreational, and religious life of the American people between 1763 and 2005. Working under the editorial direction of general editor Randall M. Miller, professor of history at St. Joseph's University, a group of expert volume editors carefully integrate material drawn from volumes in Greenwood's highly successful Daily Life Through History series with new material researched and written by themselves and other scholars. The four volumes cover the following periods: The War of Independence and Antebellum Expansion and Reform, 1763-1861, The Civil War, Reconstruction, and the Industrialization of America, 1861-1900, The Emergence of Modern America, World War I, and the Great Depression, 1900-1940 and Wartime, Postwar, and Contemporary America, 1940-Present. Each volume includes a selection of primary documents, a timeline of important events during the period, images illustrating the text, and extensive bibliography of further information resources-both print and electronic-and a detailed subject index.",

'There exists the myth in America that it has always been the most peaceful of nations.' This is false, Leckie says. The truth is actually that 'America is the most fightingist society to ever emerge' and that the United States has fought and won more military engagements then any other nation.

Colonial Wars (French and Indian War, King Philip's War)2. American Revolution3. War of 18124. War With Mexico5. Civil War6. Spanish-American War, Indian Wars, and the Philippine Insurrection7. World War 18. World War 29. Korean War10. Vietnam War11. Gulf War\"The Wars of America\" is the 3rd Leckie book I have read and enjoyed this one like the others (George Washington's War, From Sea to Shining Sea). The reading level is appropriate for the basic US history buff rather than the professor or life-long student.While the book is a good read, there are some errors. For example, on page 198 Leckie states that the surrender of 5500 American troops in Charleston SC to the British during the American Revolutionary War was the largest US surrender of troops until the surrender at Bataan in 1942. Fact: Around 12000 US troops were surrendered to the Confederates at Harpers Ferry WV in September 1862 just prior to the battle of Antietam MD.Such errors would not escape the scrutiny of a history professor or someone who has been a life-long student of US military history. Another weakness is the lack of maps. Having many more maps would help the reader have a greater understanding of US military history and strategy.Again, this book is not for the history professor or advanced student. However, I would recommend the book as a good introduction for someone who is just starting to get interested in US military history.",

Part of our basic training was attending a military history class where a young lieutenant made the mistake of asking us to show a hand if we could name a war that America had fought. Because of Robert Leckie, I could name them all of course. I don't think the lieutenant ever recovered...at least he was more careful thereafter when tempted to ask a patronizing question of us privates. As an aside, it's amazing how often King Philip's War is mentioned in print, despite it's apparent obscurity. The volume is well worth $34.90 new or $1.26 used.

Over the years, his somewhat erudite writing inspired a substantial portion of American popular culture. His \"The Savage Gentleman\" is generally considered the seed for Doc Savage, just as his \"Gladiator\" supposedly formed the idea behind Superman. Some writers have gone so far as to claim that Flash Gordon evolved from \"When Worlds Collide.\"&lt;\"Triumph,\" originally published in 1963, concerns World War III and its aftermath. At the time of its publication, atomic war was considered almost inevitable...and somewhat immediate. Wylie's description of that war in \"Triumph\" remains horrifying and sobering.&lt;As does the core of the book, which has to do with how human nature adapts to its circumstances while remaining essentially the same. It is unfortunate, Wylie emphasizes, that the destructive side of human nature will remain intact.&lt;Wylie's mix of characters is somewhat forced, almost like a menu of a modern \"politically correct\" cast list. The 14 survivors of the war - holed up inside a Connecticut mountain - include representatives of several races and all the economic classes.

Like many (most?) novels of that generation, the Soviets start the thing (thanks to a maniacal Russian premier) and boy have they planned this thing out. Not only are basic nuke weapons used, but the Reds have all but ensured that NO ONE will survive in the United States ever again. They explode submerged nukes off both coasts to create super-radioactive sodium clouds, and later detonate cobalt devices. The fourteen folks living in a specially prepared Connecticut bunker are indeed the last people left alive in the US. The description of these folks' lives in the bunker is fairly well done, although it is unlikely -- given the degree of Soviet bombing -- that the devastation would be limited to just the northern hemisphere. (ON THE BEACH is probably more accurate in that such an amount of radioactivity would eventually make its deadly path to the southern hemisphere, too.) The ending is somewhat uplifting if not, again, implausible. Considering the degree of devastation and total rad count, it is much more likely that all the bunker inhabitants would eventually perish in their livable tomb.",

I can see that this would have had great interest and impact in the year it was written, 1963. But reading this in 2009, what struck me was the knowledge and sophistication the author possessed to address all of the related technical content: elaborate bomb shelter (U.S.150-200 million dollars in 1963 currency), the effects of nuclear strikes, not to mention the way he envisioned the catalyst and method of how the two superpowers would war.The most gripping part of the book was a side story covering a few remaining U.S. naval forces and their Soviet counterparts who had prepared their own incredible shelters to survive. The \"last ditch\" strategy had me thinking about other books on nuclear war from that period that I believe more accurately portrayed military members reluctance to do any more damage after first strike. Here U.S. forces are portrayed as mindless order takers bent on revenge.The anti-Soviet rhetoric speaks to the times though the enemy seems less menacing, all knowing, and relentlessly diabolical now that time has passed. Character development was so-so, most interesting is the mogul who anticipated so much in the building of his shelter. Inter-relationships were hard to get in to but the claustrophobic atmosphere was well communicated.Triumph has introduced me to Wylie who is credited with inspiring Doc Savage with his book The Savage Gentleman, also Flash Gordon with When Worlds Collide, and incredibly, Superman with his work Gladiator. The latter I intend to pick up as the story behind the story is as intriguing.",

The survivors in this story don't \"seethe with hatred\", the intent of the story isn't some liberal wet-dream of how nasty we all would be if locked in a room with people of other races or ethnic/economic backgrounds. It details the survival - at great cost and with great difficulty - of a mixed group that truly represents the best of us all, along with the realistic presence of bigotry and snobbish class distinction as expressed by some people. The true import is how well these people work together, pull together to not only survive but to rescue a few others who didn't die in the first nuclear exchange.The stage is set by the creation of a very well planned bomb shelter designed and built at great cost by a wealthy businessman in Connecticut. The characters may be slightly shallow, but they are representative of a good cross-section of America - rich, poor, and middle class; white, black and Asian; educated and hardworking versus marginally schooled and wealthy layabout, even one man of dubious character who rises to the occasion and proves to be able to demonstrate virtues that might have escaped him in easier times and circumstances, and includes two children rescued when their parents have died.The book's title concerns the triumph of humanity in this cross-section of America, and how they survive through working together for each other's benefit. One of the reviewers of this book opines that it is unrealistic, because he or she believes the entire world would have been rendered unfit for human life. Fortunately, Philip Wylie was a very intelligent and knowledgeable man, sought after by our government and various think-tanks of the fifties and sixties to consider the possible effects and results of nuclear warfare (he wrote several other books dealing with the topic). Mr. Wylie was aware that there was an excellent chance that there would NOT be much exchange of radioactivity between the north and south hemispheres due to the wind patterns at the equator blocking such exchange (the \"doldrums\" IIRC prevent much atmospheric exchange - but I am not an atmospheric scientist, nor would I trust most of the climate scientists we have been misled by in the past ten or fifteen years).So, I believe it is quite possible that the countries that live south of the equator - New Zealand and Australia especially - might have gotten through an exchange between America and Russia without the kind of devastation or radioactive contamination that would occur to the north. Even if not, however, it is possible to suspend disbelief (as is required for most of the science-based movies these days) long enough to enjoy the triumph of spirit and determination as displayed by these survivors of a Northern Hemispheric nuclear war.

                "review/text": "\"Crusade In Europe\" is General Eisenhower's memoir of the period from the early days of World War II, during which America waited for its involvement to begin, through the early post-war dealings with our erstwhile allies. As the premier figure among the Western Allies, his story and observations are crucial to an understanding of the Great Crusade.Ike takes the reader along with him through each stage of the Crusade. We view events from a perspective which lets us see aspects which we otherwise might have missed. Having attracted attention for his performance in Army maneuvers in Louisiana in 1940, Ike was called to Washington immediately after Pearl Harbor because of his recent experience in the Philippines. He was immediately assigned to work on plans for the Pacific. At this point the reader is reminded that, in contrast to the later Germany First Policy, the American public, for a time, screamed for revenge on Japan before dealing with Germany.Assigned to command Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa in 1942, Ike was charged with obtaining Allied Cooperation and was plunged into the morass of French politics. The disappointing involvement with Gen. Giraud presented an intra-allied problem, as did cooperation of Adm. Darlan, who while too helpful to rebuff, brought with him the stigma of association with a collaborator. The age-old Arab-Jewish hostility further complicated the administration of the liberated territory.With North Africa cleared out, Ike was charged with the conquest of Sicily. Management of the Patton-Montgomery rivalry was a major challenge of the campaign. Success having been achieved, the Patton slapping incident forced Ike to reprimand a close friend while threatening to deprive him of one of his most effective Army commanders.Speculation that Ike would return to the Washington as Chief Of Staff while Gen. Marshall commanded Overlord, the invasion of Europe, distracted Ike's attention from problems at hand. Ike's eventual appointment to command Overlord forced him to leave the Mediterranean while the Italian campaign was still in doubt. Upon arrival in England he immediately switched gears to plan the size, timing, supply and location of the invasion of France.With the invasion ashore, Ike skillfully managed his coalition of impetuous commanders in their march across Europe. Ike brings the reader into the thought processes and conferences leading to decisions on the liberation of Paris, Operation Market-Garden (\"A Bridge Too Far\") and the Battle of The Bulge.Americans are familiar with Patton's claim that, with supplies, he could capture Berlin and win the war. Ike relates that Monty bothered him with similarly impractical suggestions. He then explains why the proposals were doomed to failure. Spirited arguments with the British over Project Anvil (Invasion of Southern France) come within the reader's vision through Ike's eyes.The greatest criticism of Ike's wartime leadership is reserved for questions about whether the Western Allies should have advanced further to limit the Red Army's area of occupation. Ike assesses the claims and presents support for his decisions.After V-E Day, Ike's role shifted more into that of a statesman as he attempted to obtain cooperation with the Russians over the administration of occupied Germany.Some things come clearly through the pages of this book. The reader is constantly impressed with the importance of supplies, bringing to mind the adage that \"Amateurs speak of tactics, professionals speak of logistics.\" Despite later controversies, Ike's admiration for Gen. George Marshall is made clear on the pages of this book. Written in 1948, I find the statement that Ike disagreed with many of FDR's domestic policies to be surprising and a hint of his later political initiatives. \"Crusade In Europe\" is written in a very clear, easy to read and follow, style. It never becomes bogged down in boring details. Among memoirs, this is a gem.",

He wrote this book in 1948 without ghost-writers, and his wit and wisdom are stunning. Everyone needs to read this to understand the issues that face us in Iraq and elsewhere today. The general explains how the real work of the military is developing strategy, drawing up plans, building relationships with governments and civilians, and quickly implementing and changing the plans as required. Only criticism is his tencency to dismiss the inappropriate behavior of Patton, but keep in mind that Patton was already dead when this book was written and Eisenhower would not criticize those who were not positioned to defend themselves. He is critical of others, especially Montgomery for his foolish proposal of launching a blitz on Berlin to bring the war to an early end. Another lesson for our time is the treachery of the French troops both in Vichy and Algeria, who fight the Allied invasion and put personal objectives above military and political goals. Unbelievable candor throughout such as when Eisenhower reports that an obviously overwhelmed Truman offers to help Eisenhower in any way that he can, including supporting him for the Presidency in 1948. Important career lesson: Eisenhower did not receive any significant promotions in the 20 years after WWI and was doing staff work under McArthur for 5 years, building up the Filipino military, yet became the highest rank allied commander, through hard work, dedication, and leadership.",

After reading this book it's easy to see why.This book is not as frank as we would expect today, and some of incidents are presented as if written by Norman Rockwell. Yet this book is excellent in presenting Eisenhower's view of the war. It is a view from on high, and it is best contrasted with Bradley's book, _A Soldier's Story_, which is much more emotional, direct and forthright.But it's easy to see Eisenhower's much broader perspective. He's much more concerned with the issues of organizing and prosecuting the war from the questions of where are we going to get the materials, the ships, the troops, the ammunition, the landing craft, etc., than is Bradley, who is almost completely--again remembering from 27 years ago--involved only with the battles and which division is where.Also, it's often not hard to read between the lines on those occassions when Eisenhower retreats into puff prose, to know what he was really thinking.5 stars, because I don't see how one can understand the military aspect of WWII in western Europe without having read this book.",

                "review/text": "This should be required reading in high schools and universities. The description of battles is not the primary focus. The book is about the political and military personalities, the political and economic considerations, the benefits and problems of press coverage, risk management, planning and preparation, limitations of material and transportation, the justification of risking lives, military vs. social issues, the impossibility of knowing everything and always being right, individual efforts (from generals to troops), the consequences of weather, seasonal considerations, the importance of unified command, team building, and morale. Morale is critical, requiring many factors and constant effort.It is the fleshed out, rounded picture of war and people that makes it interesting. Of course, he is an politically astute, or he would not have been able to do the job; so, he doesn't really give the dirt on people even while indicating problems.He fully understands the critical issues of logistics and the productive capacity of a nation at war. (For an even deeper understanding of this, and how it fails under dictatorships from ancient Sparta and Rome to modern Germany and Japan, see the chapter, \"The Energy Circuit in Wartime,\" in Paterson's \"The God of the Machine.\")Given the various failures and miscalculations of large operations, the reader can easily imagine that given the attitudes of modern press coverage of Iraq by shallow minded news anchors and politicians, neither Eisenhower, nor Bradly, nor Montgomery, nor Patton would have been able to keep their jobs.One lesson: It takes months, even years to properly plan and prepare for major military operations, depending on the strength of the enemy. In this case, from the need to design and build new types of landing craft to the need for feeding the civilians of Europe.",

In this book, you can see the European war from the perspective of the man who led the war. What many considered Eisenhower's greatest asset, the diplomatic manner that helped the Americans and British function as one Allied team, is also very apparent in this book.Eisenhower's story, written just a few years after the war ended, gives the reader a great high-level perspective on the war. He mentions his staff work with the War Department at the beginning of the war before being posted to Europe, and then the balance of the book covers the Mediterranean and European campaigns against the Germans. This isn't a comprehensive history of the war in Europe (for example, he covers Operation Market-Garden in three paragraphs), but instead more of a general overview from Eisenhower's perspective.Many consider Eisenhower's diplomatic skills - his ability to lead a multi-national organization - as his greatest asset and the reason he was chosen to lead the Allied Armies in Europe. Eisenhower carried this over into his book: he is never critical of any of his subordinates, defends all of their actions and beliefs (even when Eisenhower disagreed or overruled them), and never even mentions specific names in the couple of instances where he says that commanders were relieved. While this is certainly a laudable trait in a leader, it doesn't make this a particularly insightful book.Although \"Crusade in Europe\" lacks that hard-hitting punch, Eisenhower does tell some entertaining and fun personal stories. Because of these stories and Eisenhower's unique perspective on the war, I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in World War II.",

                "review/text": "General Eisenhower presents a very unique perspective on the ETO throughout Crusade in Europe since he was the one and only Supreme Allied Commander in the theatre. In his role as Commander, he was privy to a vast array of the decision making discussions that took place to create the Allied strategy against Nazi Germany. In this book, he brings to light a lot of the strategic thinking and planning that went into the Allied victory in WWII. Therefore, I would consider this book required reading for anyone interested in WWII history.Having said that, I think that the book does fall short of its objective for two main reasons. First, Ike is hesitant to criticize other leaders for bad decisions, and tactical mistakes. For instance, Ike blames the lack of success in Operation Market Garden more on the weather than the ill conceived plan that Monty used to execute this daring mission. Secondly, Ike does not display much emotion when telling the tale. For example, when Ike talks about the Battle of the Bulge, he infurs that the Allies expected the attack, and felt almost no panic when it came. If you look at books from others involved in the fighting, you get a much different perspective.Overall, I enjoyed this book and wished I could give it 5 stars. It should be a 5-star book, because of the unique position that Ike fulfilled in the ETO. Instead, I give it 4 stars, but highly recommend it to anyone interested in WWII history.",

                "review/text": "Very good book for someone seeking the view of the War in Europe from Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, essentially the CEO of the war in the west. Not a ghostwritten account, and at times it's difficult to keep straight the one-star and two-star generals, as Ike mentions the name, what he did, and whether he was British, Canadian, or American. A professionial writer (although this is still a very readable book) would add a physical desription, and when the name comes up again, that writer would refer to him as \"the British general.\"I read Churchill's \"Second World War\" before this, and it's interesting to see Churchill's various rebuttals to criticisms by Ike of the Prime Minister. (There weren't that many of them).One almost comical account was Churchill's insistance that he visit the Normandy beaches--on D-Day! Luckily, King George stepped in and resolved the situation and kept the 69 year-old Prime Minister in London on June 6.Ike does a pretty good job of keeping the Zeus-like egos of Montgomery, Patton and DeGaulle in check, too.In my opinion, Eisenhower doesn't get as much credit as he deserves, as just getting a force of the size of the Allied Expeditionary Force supplied with ammnuniton, fuel, food and the like was a monumental task.",

                "review/text": "`The New Polish Cuisine' by Chicago chef Michael J. Baruch and `Polish Cookery' by Marja Ochorowicz-Monatowa, translated from the Polish by Jean Karsavina are two common extremes in the presentation of a national cuisine, if that cuisine is not French, Italian, Spanish, Indian, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, or Mexican. I have seen many of the latter style for virtually every nation from Norway to Rumania, most especially from the central European countries. Many of the recipes are presented in the most simple of forms, with little or no discussion of technique. Their primary virtue lies in their containing a lot of authentic recipes so that if you are handy around the kitchen, you should have no trouble with the simple instructions. After all, Elizabeth David started her prodigious career as a food writer by doing a book on Mediterranean recipes with relatively simple recipe descriptions.As a native Pole wrote `Polish Cookery' in Poland, I have to assume the authenticity of the recipes is unimpeachable. And, in spite of my picturing the recipes in books of this class as `bare bones' descriptions, I am especially happy to say that the general introductions to all the major sections have great suggestions on how to get the best out of each type of dish. The introduction to the section that includes pierogies is an especially good example, as it gives excellent general rules for preparing pastry fillings. These rules are:1. Cook meat until tender, but do not brown, or it will be too dry.2. Grind meat at least twice through a meat grinder.3. Pates may be baked, but they are best steamed, as baking dries and toughens them.These three simple rules contain an enormous amount of wisdom as they clearly distinguish this cooking style from braising and sauteeing and show a great common ground with the famous steamed meat filled dumplings of Chinese dim sum. This second rule also points out that the author is talking about a kitchen where a meat grinder is a common appliance and a blender and food processor are not. This may seem odd, except that my Hungarian grandmother did have a meat grinder and used it on a regular basis. (One warning is that while the index is excellently done with both Polish and English entries, it may be just a little difficult to find some familiar dishes if you only know the English name. I had to look carefully to fine pierogies recipes, as the only reference to pierogies was in Polish.)I give this detail to warn anyone who may be inclined to ignore this book in favor of the volume with which I will compare it. This little book is marvelously inexpensive, hard covered, and sound. As complete as it is, I am surprised that it does not include any bread recipes and most basic pastry recipes are attributed to the French.This is one thing which pleases me so much about Michael Baruch's book, as it starts out with a chapter of excellent recipes for fresh yeast breads, featuring great rye and pumpernickel bread recipes, which are not always available in bread baking books. All bread recipes are done with a yeast sponge and technique that would make Peter Reinhart proud.I am happy that chef Baruch started out with such a great opening chapter because there is much in this book to turn one off if you are inclined to nit-pick. In fact, if this book were a general cookbook by some new TV celebrity show off cook, I would pan it for its misspellings, conceits, and clumsy statements. As it is an excellent presentation of Polish cuisine as interpreted by an American chef with several worthwhile sections and good details on cooking techniques, I overlook the copy editor's mistakes and focus on the chef's content.One thing in this book that is odd to find in a volume on a minor national cuisine is a catalogue of cooking and baking equipment. I tend to pan these lists, as they are often a basis for buying things you may never need. This is particularly true of the list of baking equipment. The list of pots and pans has it's foibles, as certain types of equipment are listed twice for no reason, but if you overlook that, the list is especially good, especially with the recommendation for having two non-stick fry pans. I do warn you against his critique of Calphalon pots, as I have found their anodized aluminum ware to be excellent and their inexpensive all metal Teflon ware to be perfect for the amateur cook.For an oversized book with really excellent photographs, I find the $32 list price to be a very nice deal. One thing the author establishes very well is the influence on Polish cooking from Renaissance Italy. The danger in this observation is that it is sometimes hard to distinguish between Polish dishes with Italian influences and Italian dishes the author added to pad his pages. If you think I am just guessing about this, check out the recipe for `Hail Thaddeus Caesarski Salad'. In spite of the Polish name, the recipe looks almost identical to the original prepared in Tijuana by Caesar Cardini. This filler is odd in that the author states that he has enough material for another volume sometime in the future. I strongly suspect the contents of this volume have more to do with Chef Baruch's professional repertoire and childhood experiences in Chicago than with a comprehensive presentation of Polish cuisine.In one very important area, Chef Baruch may have the advantage over the translation from the Polish. The sections on pirogues gives recipes for at least three different doughs, none of which are French and all of which were probably prepared by legions of Polish grandmothers.If you really love Polish cooking, get both books. If you simply want a book on Polish recipes to round out a collection of national cuisines, get the `new' book.",

After years of collecting stodgy, uninteresting and badly written Eastern European cookbooks, it is refreshing to finally come across one that is well written, beautifully photographed and is fully laden with well rounded chapters of recipes that actually work. I recently purchased a celebrity chef cookbook and was so disappointed with the recipes offered that I sent it right back. It seems to me the price tag on those celebrity books is inversely related to the content and value. Not so with Chef Baruch's New Polish Cuisine. At $32.00, it is a real bargain. As a grandmother of 12, it's highly admirable that this accomplished young chef took it upon himself (without any help from a big publishing company as the book is self-published) to lighten up, revitalize and Americanize a cuisine that is generally heavy and fat laden. Most Polish cookbooks I own were published in the 60's with recipes and techniques from the dark ages and have never held any interest for my children or grandchildren. However, Mr. Baruch's book has renewed my family's interest in the food of their ethnic heritage and the history related to it. The 3 pound, beautifully hard bound book with full color pictures is this grandma's favorite gift to give. Besides the fabulous recipes, the stories and introductions to each chapter are heart warming and bring comfort. Kudos to Chef Barch for bridging the generation gap!",

Global human rights offered individuals unprecedented guarantees beyond the nation for the protection of political, economic, social and cultural freedoms. The World Reimagined explores how these revolutionary developments first became believable to Americans in the 1940s and the 1970s through everyday vernaculars as they emerged in political and legal thought, photography, film, novels, memoirs and soundscapes. Together, they offered fundamentally novel ways for Americans to understand what it means to feel free, culminating in today's ubiquitous moral language of human rights. Set against a sweeping transnational canvas, the book presents a new history of how Americans thought and acted in the twentieth-century world.",

It is wonderful to have this collection of reporting from those years. Too often, people remember their history from Hollywood movies, where everything is glorious, simple, and victory is assured in the end. In real life, there is chaos, a determination to endure, but victory is not known until it is finally attained.This volume picks up in Italy during 1944 and ends with victory in the Pacific and the aftermath of Hiroshima. There are articles on the Battle of the Bulge, Iwo Jima, the death of F.D.R, the death of Ernie Pyle in the Pacific from a sniper's bullet, the German surrender, and dozens more.One of the most touching is an extended piece on the Japanese Internment camps with pen and ink drawings by one of the Japanese. Bill Mauldin also has a piece in here with his famous WWII cartoons of the GIs at the front. William Laurence gives a famous account of the bombing of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.There is a section of fine photos of the reporters included and others in the text including some aerial shots from a bomber's point of view. This first volume ends with the Mountain Campaign in Italy in 1944. The volume also supplies a short, but full chronology of the war, some excellent maps, biographies of the journalists, acknowledgements, notes on the texts, and a glossary of military terms.This, together with the first volume, is a collection of important history you will want to have on your shelf.Tremendous.",
