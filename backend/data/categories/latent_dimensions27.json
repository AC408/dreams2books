        "Title": "microcosm and mediator the theological anthropology of maximus the confessor",
        "description": "One of the outstanding Christian thinkers of all time, Maximus the Confessor (ca. 580-662) exerted a powerful formative influence on the Church when it was still one and undivided. Maximus left his stamp on Christianity as it is now recognized by all three broad streams of Christian faith: Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant. Yet for centuries the detailed study of Maximus's writings was neglected. The first edition of Thunberg's Microcosm and Mediator (1965) helped to transform this situation of indifference into one of intense interest in Maximus and the subtleties of his thinking. This new edition has been revised and expanded, with updated references and bibliographies. The focus of Microcosm and Mediator is Maximus's anthropology, his highly developed general reflections on human nature. Maximus understands man as, not only a being - a microcosm - who reflects the constitution of the created universe, but also as a being - a mediator - created in the image of God, whose task it is, in Christ, to reconcile the spiritual and the sensible into one homogeneous unity.",

                "review/text": "It was the late Benedictine scholar Polycarp Sherwood, of St. Meinrad's abbey in rural southern Indiana, who broke wide open the historical and theological study of Maximus the Confessor's writings in the 1950s. But it was the Swedish scholar Lars Thunberg, in the first edition of Microcosm and Mediator (1965), who took Maximian research to a new level of critical analysis. This second edition of Thunberg's work, the major revisions of which appear mainly in the updated introduction, notes, and bibliography, has as its organizing principle the theological anthropology of Maximus; but this book is rich in insights into his christology, cosmology, soteriology, eschatology, asceticism, and ethics as well. In fact the only major dimension of Maximus's thought not substantially treated here is his trinitarian theology, although the book includes a brilliant short treatment of the function of apophatic theology in the Confessor's work.Thunberg's basic judgments concerning the overall structure of Maximus's thought are still as valid now as when Microcosm and Mediator first appeared three decades ago. He asserts succinctly &quot;that Maximus' anthropology holds the key to his theology as a whole, and that this anthropology, in its turn, is a fruit of the Confessor's personal reflection on the Christological convictions of the Council of Chalcedon, as they were further demonstrated and explained through the Council of Constantinople in 553&quot; (19). Thunberg's achievement has been to demonstrate how the Neo-Chalcedonian perspective of a &quot;theandric&quot; communion of natures, negotiated hypostatically and perichoretically in Jesus Christ, frames Maximus's entire vision of the partnership between Creator and cosmos (on the macrocosmic level), and more specifically between God and the human microcosm. The properly polemical (viz., anti-Origenist) character of Maximus's thought--his thorough rehabilitation of cosmic unity-in-diversity; his profoundly incarnational christocentrism--is rightly highlighted. Where Thunberg's study excels, however, is in detailing how Maximus' anthropology is, in the truest sense, constructively theological anthropology and the fruit of his integrative synthesis.Thunberg begins with Maximus's construal of the primary structures of human nature, that nature which is a microcosm of the purposeful unity-in-diversity in the created order. Maximus does envision a &quot;natural&quot; state of humanity, at least in terms of the antecedent principle (logos) which assures the basic integrity of human nature and volition over and beyond the disastrous consequences of the fall. But the &quot;natural state&quot; of humanity, as it were, is less a static or ideal condition than a created vocation set before collective humankind, as created in the image of God, freely and &quot;rationally&quot; to mediate for all of creation, to perform the &quot;cosmic liturgy&quot; through theandric communion with the Creator. Meanwhile, as a realist about human history and about the reality of the fall, Maximus spends little time on Adam's pristine or natural state, stipulating that he abused his freedom &quot;at the instant of his creation&quot; (Ambiguum 61), thereby implicating his human posterity and tragically frustrating the natural destiny of humankind.As Thunberg reveals, human nature (ontologically) and human asceticism (existentially) together constitute the theater, or microcosm, in which the drama of redemption from the fall and, simultaneously, the vindication of humanity's cosmic vocation, leading to deification, unfolds. Within this scheme of things, the practice of virtue (including the cosmic virtue of love) in the imitation of Christ serves to reintegrate human nature and thus reestablish the microcosm. The disintegration brought about by manifold passions is reversed, such that the differentiated passible faculties (epithymia and thymia) are once more reoriented to their intended goal. Within the spiritual life properly speaking (bios praktikos and bios thertikos), Maximus envisions humanity embracing and actively performing the various &quot;mediations&quot; to which it is called, and thus participating with Christ in bridging the chasm between male and female, between paradise and the inhabited world, between heaven and earth, between sensible and intelligible creation, and, finally, between God and his creation (Ambiguum 41). Human deification is, in the end, the capstone of this process--a process not of &quot;recovery&quot; but of genuine advance and renovation in the life of the creation. For Maximus, therefore, human deification and cosmic transfiguration are inseparable hopes, and are together grounded in the reality of the Incarnation.Thunberg retells and interprets Maximus's version of this cosmic story with grace and elegance. An added virtue is that, along the way, his monograph provides a superb general treatment of the Confessor's critical interaction with the philosophical idioms of his time, and the best general survey of his constructive engagement with earlier patristic sources: Origen, Nemesius, the Cappadocians, Evagrius, Cyril of Alexandria, Pseudo-Dionysius, inter alios. Maximus's achievement is thus displayed in its broadest contexts, all of which are important to understanding his contribution to ecumenical theology.In short, Microcosm and Mediator remains, over thirty years after its original publication, the most comprehensive and useful secondary study of Maximus the Confessor's thought.Paul M.

While the author is a Lutheran, he has a deep appreciation of this most beloved Eastern Orthodox saint and theologian, presenting Maximus' ideas clearly, sympathetically, and in a VERY detailed manner.It is silly for the other reviewer to discount the work because it has no large paortions of Maximus' work translated. It doesn't advertise itself as such and, to answer his other objection, those works are available in English and other modern languages by authors such as Andrew Louth.One shouldn't be upset if it is scholarly. It is of no use to approach a figure as complicated as Maximus and expect simple reading. I should say that the other reviewer would be more confused by reading the translations of Maximus than by Thunberg's analysis!THis is a really good book with lots of great info, making it the milemarker for studies on Maximus. I would also suggest reading &quot;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church&quot; by Vladimir Lossky to understand the theological context into which St. Maximus fits.Enjoy!",

        "description": "Ken Wilbers revolutionary thinking is beginning to shift the orientation of Western culture. Wilber combines his knowledge as mystic, scientist, psychologist and philosopher to create comprehensive concepts for understanding our world and our place in it. This integral approach is much needed in a world torn by conflicts of religion, culture, and ideology. Lew Howard says, I wrote this book to make the work of Ken Wilber accessible to the average person. Wilbers integral understanding (which is an interlocking whole) is broken down into concepts that can be individually understood. These understandings result in an integral conception of the Kosmos. Wilbers insights revolutionized my spiritual practiceand can do the same for you.",

                "review/text": "In 1973 a young biochemistry student leaves grad school to pursue an area of study that is generally considered the antithesis of intellectual maturity. He wants to study consciousness, not as a Skinnerian phantom byproduct of the brain, but as a multidimensional reality--spanning from id to ego to soul to all-pervading Spirit. Ken Wilber, age 24, begins to write a book about this &quot;spectrum of consciousness,&quot; detailing both how Spirit &quot;steps down&quot; into time and space to create an EM-like spectrum of levels of awareness, and how various schools of inquiry are all definitely studying the same basic &quot;consciousness,&quot; but from entirely different perspectives. Because each level of the spectrum has its own distinct contours, Wilber explains, disparate disciplines of investigation (e.g., Freudian and Buddhist) might at first seem contradictory, but only if it isn't understood that consciousness manifests in _levels_, with each valid approach simply speaking to a specific level.Thus, with that insight, Wilber establishes a model that instantly diffuses decades of bickering between researchers of the vague and mysterious &quot;consciousness.&quot; It's as though a scientist, a philosopher, and a theologian had been standing around arguing for years about whose interpretation of the phenomenon called &quot;rainbow&quot; was the correct one--whether it's &quot;empirically proved to be red&quot; or &quot;most axiomatically green&quot; or &quot;nothing but violet, as the scripture says,&quot; etc.--and then some kid comes along, patiently indicates each color of a rainbow to them, and says, &quot;Look! You're ALL right!&quot; Then the three researchers stare, dumbfounded, and marvel at their stupidity.Volume One of the _Collected Works_ features that kid's first two books, _The Spectrum of Consciousness_ and _No Boundary_, as well as three essays that cover specific applications of the spectrum model to certain metaphysical concepts. _Spectrum_ begins with an overview of the model, explaining how &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; approaches to consciousness can finally be united by plugging their various lines of research into the appropriate levels of the spectrum. The next few chapters explain how reality is a &quot;nonduality&quot;--an ineffable Unity--of subject and object, and how this is crucial to understanding how the various levels of consciousness become manifest in the first place.The second part of the book is an attempt to integrate actual psychological and spiritual disciplines--both &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;Western&quot;--into the spectrum model. From Freud's &quot;id&quot; to Huang-po's &quot;Mind,&quot; a worthy attempt is made to cover all aspects of the multidimensional human psyche. The last chapters cover the &quot;transpersonal&quot; levels of soul and Spirit, with the final &quot;Always Already&quot; chapter capturing the most sacred spiritual truth--namely, that if God really is infinite and eternal, then he must be fully present right _here_ and right _now_, awake and aware as the Source of your own present level of consciousness, no matter what level that might be.The next book, _No Boundary_, begins where the last one ends. Much less scholarly in its style and approach--but ten times more entertaining and lively--it takes the nondual revelation as its starting point and then describes why we don't normally experience this state but instead find ourselves in a world of mind-made dualities. Wilber explains that all dualities are purely illusory, with no actual separation and isolation appearing anywhere in reality. Day and night are not separate, but rather blend into one another seamlessly; life and death are not different, but rather two names for the same thing. To have a death without a life is absurd, as is an up without a down or an object without a subject. Reality itself is an infinite field of &quot;unity consciousness,&quot; or nondual Spirit, with no real distinctions at all.The rest of _No Boundary_ shows how growth through the levels of the spectrum is simply a transcendence of boundaries, culminating in the final growth beyond the &quot;primary dualism&quot;--which is the split between subject and object--whereupon all duality dissolves into the seamless play of our own vast and timeless Consciousness, with neither a seer nor a seen anywhere in sight.As an introduction to nondual mysticism, _No Boundary_ is simply unsurpassed. _The Spectrum of Consciousness_ is essential reading for anyone intrigued by that peculiar &quot;thing&quot; that is right now comprehending these words, but less than satisfied with the explanations offered by the metaphysical position of scientific materialism. These books, however, are not free of error, as Wilber is the first to admit. One of the most glaring is the infamous &quot;pre/trans fallacy,&quot; or the Romantic inclination of viewing egoity as a &quot;fall&quot; from a previous God-unified state into a corrupted state of dualism and ignorance. This view sees the human child immersed in blissful unity with the world, sees the adult ego as a perversion of this &quot;pure&quot; state, and understands mystical enlightenment as a reinstatement of the childhood consciousness. This view--of development progressing from X to Y to X--is expressed in this volume of Wilber's work. But it is a position that is completely untenable, since enlightened sagacity is most definitely _not_ a regression to a pre-egoic, infantile state, but rather a development to a trans-egoic, trans-rational state. It is just that from the viewpoint of rationality (Y), both pre-rationality (X) and trans-rationality (Z), precisely because they are both _non_-rational (non-Y), can at first seem awfully similar. A closer look, however, easily reveals their differences.But that problem aside, these two books stand as the cornerstones to a philosophical vision that is growing increasingly integral and all-around _useful_ with each subsequent publication. It is his masterful style of putting the most deep and complex subjects into simple and lively wording--to say nothing of his sheer brilliance--that have won Ken Wilber such worldwide adoration. For this philosophically stimulating and spiritually profound introduction to his work--despite the minor system kinks that hadn't yet been worked out--I can only give my fullest recommendation. Read it, learn it, love it, and if you're willing, _live_ it, for the central message of Wilber's work is far from theoretical.",

                "review/text": "Open the front cover of this book, and you'll see a four-color glossy reproduction of Rembrandt's &quot;The Return of the Prodigal Son,&quot; which captured the imagination of the late Henri Nouwen, whose best book personalizes that painting's characters and themes.Inspired by Nouwen, McMinn, a psychology professor at Wheaton College (Illinois), went to St. Petersburg, Russia to &quot;sit with&quot; the Rembrandt and there decided to write this book about sin and grace --- far different, he says, from a never-published &quot;book about grace&quot; he wrote 15 years ago. The difference? From the perspective of empty-nest, middle age, he sees that one cannot understand grace &quot;without understanding sin.&quot;After two introductory chapters grounded in his epiphanic reaction to the Prodigal Son parable and painting, McMinn looks at sin from three perspectives: theology, psychology and spirituality. Noting the problems with a prevalent, secular &quot;I'm OK, you're OK&quot; mindset and a judgmental &quot;I'm OK, you're a mess&quot; stance, he concludes that it's wiser and more realistic, albeit countercultural, to admit, &quot;I'm a mess, you're a mess.&quot; The voice of this humble stance draws the reader in; it turns what could have been an analytical book into an insightful, refreshing read. Through revealing (but not too) personal anecdotes, McMinn, the professor and expert, becomes a fellow traveler. &quot;Our greatest hope is going through a long, slow process of understanding our messes, acknowledging our part in the problem, then seeking resolution and restoration.&quot;Being a psychologist, not a theologian, his insights get better as the book progresses, but early on he does lay out good distinctions among three dimensions of sin: sinfulness, the &quot;white noise&quot; of original sin that &quot;touches every aspect of our existence&quot;; sins, the choices we make to &quot;violate God's instruction&quot;; and the consequences of sin, our own and others'. The point of this synopsis? &quot;Only as we begin to grasp the immensity of the sin problem are we able to glimpse the depth of God's grace, and paradoxically, seeing God's grace gives us courage to face our sinfulness.&quot;Much of part 2, &quot;The Damage Report,&quot; which discusses the psychological perspective of sin, hones in on pride, &quot;the utmost evil,&quot; according to C. S. Lewis --- how it wreaks havoc in our passions (&quot;in our pride we love and hate the wrong things,&quot; writes McMinn) and also in our minds (&quot;pride taints our thinking as well as our affections&quot;). McMinn then spends a chapter acknowledging that we are not sinful trash but rather &quot;noble ruins&quot; --- made in the image of God.Part 3, &quot;Homeward Bound,&quot; draws us toward God and the grace he offers --- through himself and through people working on his behalf --- notably as we admit our sinfulness and sins. The best lines in the book may be those under the heading &quot;Repentance and Forgiveness&quot;: &quot;Time does not heal all wounds. Time heals clean wounds. Soiled wounds fester and infect, leading to bitterness and cynicism, to terrorism and war, to divided marriages and wounded children ...&quot;When we humbly admit our weaknesses and faults to God and to one another, we create the possibility for the intimacy we long for and we catch a glimpse of heaven.&quot;It's hard to categorize this book. It is not self-help or how-to. Nor is it heavy theology (for all the talk of sin and grace, there isn't much technical talk of the Atonement). Nor is it a devotional. This is not a book for or of interest to men more than women. (Having said that, I note that in seven pages of endnotes, McMinn cites only two women; surely this says something about our fallen world, though it's hard for me to articulate what.)Like the works of Henri Nouwen, WHY SIN MATTERS is a thoughtful, insightful nudge toward spiritual and psychological growth. It could well complement pastoral or clinical therapy. Its insights will be valuable for anyone who has sung John Newton's &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and resonated with or has conversely been repulsed by its most difficult phrase: &quot;a wretch like me.&quot;--- Reviewed by Evelyn Bence",

However, since being a JW from about 1978-2001 I have reviewed it yet again and find it jives perfectly with what I observed, heard and felt as well as comments from a number of other writers in the area of JW literature.For instance, if I had taken it more seriously at the time I would not have gotten caught up with this cult which from silentlambs.org (also there see NBC and CBS transcripts) we now know has been having local elders send \"repentant\" child molesters preaching door-to-door alongside very decent, unsuspecting JW parents and their children!Again, Schnell's book remains a short but extremely powerful work, a truly classical expose in the literature.",

His relentless quest to understand the nature of life through travel, extensive reading, and constant conversation with a diverse array of compatriots ultimately led Kazantzakis to compose this book of \"spiritual exercises\" meant to help the reader achieve harmony between the countervailing human impulses toward an immortality-seeking asceticism and toward a more nihilistic and materialist view of death. As with all Kazantzakis's philosophical works, The Saviors of God sheds light on a mind uniquely suited to a nuanced examination of what it means to be human, and establishes a hopeful vision for a dazzlingly syncretic approach to spiritual life.",

There was much more to this man than met the eye, however. Such Americans don't know the reader of Nietzsche and Bergson, the man who idolized both Christ and Lenin as saviors of humanity, the brooding genius whose incisive glacial intellect was perpetually at war with the hot blood of his idealism and passion. A fascinating and fragmented character who ascended the peaks and explored the dark valleys of human experience more than most, Kazantzakis commits pen to paper here with a spirituality that will haunt the reader; it is more alive and explosive than any camp-meeting revival. Writing with a distinctly modernist tone of world-smashing and revolution akin to Marx and with a racy, frenetic, hot-blooded pace which D.H. Lawrence would've admired, Kazantzakis introduces us to HIS idea of God: not the friendly father figure of Christian lore, but the turbulent, primordial drive for life and change within the universe, striving (successfully, through sometimes violent fits and starts) to ascend, to create, to thrive, to &quot;transubstantiate matter into spirit&quot;. More akin to Bergson's idea of &quot;elan vital&quot;, this is a series of spell-binding meditations that most mainline believers of any stripe probably wouldn't like; precisely because it scares the living daylights out of you with its frightening possibilities and its sirens' call of seemingly chaotic life-affirming zest. The late Kazantzakis beckons to us across the void, urging us to take the plunge and gaze into that vortex without fear, even though we will lose all we are in the process.",

Ours is an age of excess, spiritually and materially (and all too often this line is blurred by televangelists and the like), and we, as a people, properly crave a spiritual instruction that lifts us gratefully above the banality surrounding us: a recent bumper-sticker shows the Christian fish symbol (the Greek letter alpha) &quot;eating&quot; a Darwin-fish (a fish with legs), and Bob Dylan once wrote of &quot;flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.&quot; Kazantzakis's &quot;The Saviors of God&quot; is a truly illuminating underground masterpiece (comparable to the American poet H.D.'s startling &quot;Notes on Thought and Vision&quot;), employing Kazantzakis's usual muscular language and profoundly penetrating insight into what being human really means. Although written as prose, it reads as poetry; and spirituality is not, for this Greek giant, sickly (goofily) sweet or insultingly strident, but, rather, careful, intense, intelligent, and passionate. It is this &quot;passion&quot; that drives every word Kazantzakis wrote, and in &quot;Saviors&quot; his passion is carefully distilled into a short and readable text that will, quite simply, never be forgotten by any who has licked its honey. For this is the &quot;mad honey&quot; consumed by the priestesses of Delphi, and when Kazantzakis writes of thought being a &quot;bird of flame&quot; hopping from branch to branch, one knows that one's own head is equally ablaze. So, lay aside your Bibles, your Korans, your Torahs...and prepare yourself to tremble, for &quot;The Saviors of God&quot; is a spiritual earthquake composed not of stern admonitions (yawn) or threats, but of humility before the gift of divinely-composed flesh.

Kazantzakis was excommunicated from the Greek Church for his views and writings, and finished his life in self-imposed exile on Naxos; the world of spiritual readers and seekers owes him a debt of gratitude, for sure.

                "review/text": "Jordan does show convincingly that &quot;sodomy,&quot; in the Bible defined as the sins of the men of Sodom, applies to a range of sinful activities rather than specifically homosexual ones. He does not, however, show that homosexual activity is excluded within that range of activities.But even if Jordan were to show that homosexual activity is not one of the sins of Sodom, the implication for us is merely that &quot;sodomy&quot;--if we would like to be etymologically correct--ought not be used as a term for homosexual activity. If he were to establish that, he would not be establishing that homosexual activity is not a sin. The only implication would be that we should use a different term to describe homosexual sin (as for instance was often done by using the more inclusive term &quot;luxuria,&quot; it appears). Since Jordan shows a hermeneutical friendliness to the Bible (which is what motivates his etymological interest in &quot;sodomy&quot; in the first place), he would be hard pressed to do away with passages of similar brevity in which homosexual activity is specifically labeled as a sin. (In fact he ignores these passages entirely, as the authors he reads do not, which decimates the value of his arguments around pp. 166 ff.)Regarding the Middle Ages, even if &quot;sodomy&quot; had been constructed incorrectly as a term for homosexual activity and similar sexual sins, the idea of those sins was not constructed. His interest turns out to be merely etymological through page 40.For most of the remainder of the book, Jordan moves to &quot;invention&quot; in the rhetorical sense, finding all the different ways that sodomy was discussed--seldom engaging the arguments, as though he is having enough fun repeating all the unsayable words.On 42 and towards the end, he unfairly objects to the use of places and place-names as symbols, calling this an &quot;essentialism&quot; that is &quot;antihistorical.&quot; This hermeneutical prejudice is untenable, and not just in the case of Sodom. One might say that &quot;homophobia&quot; is also one of those words that is used as &quot;an attack upon a [supposedly] malignant essence&quot; (43, cf. 167-68). If Jordan really is attacking the whole system of applying abstract words to sets of activities, he loses the ability to make many of his own points as well.For those interested in the relationship of nature and ethics, the most relevant and good parts are: 54-56, which are especially good for showing the connection between nature, reason, and ethics in Peter Damian; at 87 (and the whole section as well), esp. where Jordan summarizes how Alan of Lille demonstrates the naturalistic fallacy; after a lot of digressing, some material on Albert the Great at 126 ff.; and a good summary of Aristotle's NE at 132. By the Albert the Great section, it becomes apparent that the relation of pleasure to the natural and the moral is what is really at issue. One should also pick up some Plato on this, e.g. from the Laws, 732e, 836c-e, 838b-839c, passages which seem very pertinent. Jordan and Plato seem to diverge regarding this relation. My vote is with Plato.",

Boswell equated the modern concept of homosexuality with the medieval concept of sodomy, whereas Jordan does not.Instead, Jordan argues that the term &quot;sodomy,&quot; as used by early church fathers and pre-Renaissance theologians, was a usefully vague invective, employed not altogether differently from the ways &quot;philistinism&quot; was used later or, for that matter, the way &quot;homophobia&quot; is used in some circles today.But parallel to what Jordan says about the term &quot;homophobia,&quot; &quot;sodomy,&quot; too, has been used politically not as a precise explanation for human behavior, but as &quot;a placeholder for an explanation yet to be provided&quot; (167-68).[Arguably, as philosopher Judith Butler does argue elsewhere (cogently), the same could be said for the current uses of &quot;gay,&quot; &quot;homosexual,&quot; &quot;queer,&quot; etc., or for that matter, &quot;sex.&quot;]Jordan's book is an important one for people who identify themselves as either Christian or gay (--or both) because it addresses issues underlying the clash of values and &quot;culture wars&quot; being played out in society now. If indeed, as Jordan suggests, &quot;sodomy&quot; was invented to fill a gap left by Christendom's refusal of the &quot;erotic&quot;--even between two sexes, perhaps progress lies in our seeking a place for the erotic INSIDE the moral, instead of persisting in (often hypocritically) dichotomizing the two--something, in response to a previous reader's comments, Plato did NOT do (though the later Platonists did).",

One striking feature is that this tradition/discourse only began more than a thousand years after Christ, who is not recorded as having condemned sodomy or sodomites.",

I recommend it as the best first Wilber book, as a relatively accessible introduction to his thought. That said, this is not a popular market &quot;spirituality&quot; book. There is a lot of meat here.I am among those who think Ken Wilber is one of the great thinkers of our time. His great contribution to world thought is as an integrator of a staggering breadth of philosophical thought, psychological research and accounts of mystical experience. He maintains that each of the wisdom traditions and methods of inquiry into human experience has at least some valid contribution to make. He then sets about the daunting task of finding the ground upon which they all can be said to agree and integrating them into a theoretical structure that can be used to understand how, though no single discipline can present the whole truth, all can deliver a piece of it. For example, it is not that neuroscience is right and mysticism is wrong or vice versa. They are both right but incomplete. There really are neurons that can be observed to behave in certain ways. But that is not, and cannot be, all there is to say about human experience. Wilber succeeds establishing an integral theory of consciousness that draws from the wisdom of all the traditions of inquiry to a greater extent than any other thinker I have read.I have read nine of Wilber's books so far, and I think this is the best one to start with, if you are interested in looking into his work. For those who have read some of his other work, this is a good, succinct overview of his system that can be a useful look at the forest when you get immersed into some of the more detailed material about the trees.",

The recent publication of his 'collected works' is only further evidence that his ego is about as large as his photo on the cover of this book.It may be fashionable in some circles to stand in awe of someone who throws around names of researchers in specific fields of study like Santa does with candy. However, this is not enough to show that he has adequately mastered any of these fields. When stripped of these and other ornaments, there is actually very little substance left.My one major objection to his theories is that he is apparently unaware how his own cultural bias shapes his thoughts. The division of everything into four quadrants (one/many and subjective/objective) is a Western division. It is by no means universal. These quadrants are so fundamental to his reasoning that what he claims to be a universal theory of everything is little more than the millionth Western view of reality. To the extent that he integrates diverse worldviews, he all makes them fit within his own biased scheme.Secondly, he talks about 'higher' forms of consciousness as if he knows them like his back pocket. He sees the 'non-dualistic' as the highest form of consciousness. This is clearly speculative and not based on any facts. One would think that in this day and age, transcending the 'us vs. them' duality would be the next step. This duality lies at the core of almost every conflict we see today. If Wilber was right, peace would be a very long way off.I have heard some people say in an admiring tone how they 'were trying to understand Wilber' as if he was the greatest genius that ever lived. Genius shows itself in simplicity. Sometimes, when someone is hard to understand, it is simply because they aren't making much sense. Ken Wilber is a perfect example.",

I had read a couple of Wilber's earlier books and liked them, especially the superb \"Grace and Grit.\" At his best, he can be very good at explaining a nondualistic Eastern style philosophy.As the title suggests, this book is meant to introduce people to an all encompassing metaphysical system. No one could attempt such an enterprise without a little hubris. But why stop at a little? Wilber is fond of dropping the names of long lists of famous intellectuals whose work he finds consistent with, but subservient to, his system. Reality is sliced and diced in an endless taxonomy of levels, holons, stages, paradigm shifts, quadrants, centers, spheres and fulcrums before being reassembled into a nondualistic whole. Anyone satisfied with scientific explainations is dismissed as a \"reductionist\" holding what he calls \"an insane world view.\" The science based world view is not so much argued against as it is insulted, dismissed and misrepresented.The most remarkable thing in this book is it's bizzare description of neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory. He makes the astonishing claim that very few theorists believe in Darwinian evolution and that, \"There is no evidence whatsoever for intermediate (fossil) forms.\" Wilber maintains it would take at least a hundred simultaneous beneficial mutations for something like a wing to evolve. He claims this would have to occur separately in both a male and a female who would then have to mate successfully. This is a grotesque caricature of Darwinan theory. Anyone who thinks it is adequate should buy this book. Others should read Richard Dawkins \"Climbing Mount Improbable.\" Wilber never names any scientists who advocate this version of evolution for the very good reason that there aren't any.What accounts for this straw man caricature of the most foundational scientific theory in modern biology? Well, Darwinian theory predicts that two species competing for the same niche will compete very fiercely. Wilber's Hegelian style spirit based pantheism competes with a science based pantheism in the tradition of Spinoza, Darwin and Einstein.This book is written in a question and answer format. I bought it on audio cassette. The questions were read by a young woman. Her tone indicates she is struggling to understand. She is always co-operative and eager to receive the wisdom from on high. The answers are read by a man. His tone is authoritative and patiently condescending. This is perfect for the text.Here is a one sentence sample, from the book, of Wilber's writing at it's worst: \"So we have some very popular theorists who, tired of the burdens of postconventional and world-centric rational perspectivism, recommend a regressive slide into egocentric vital impulsive polymorphous phantasmic emotional revival.\" Like Hegel, Wilber has attracted legions of readers who assume that his most incomprehensible writing must be his most brilliant. If you are willing to make that assumption, this book will delight you.",

                "review/text": "[For full review, see forthcoming, Torosyan, R. (2001). A system for everything: Book review of K. Wilber's Brief History of Everything. New Ideas in Psychology, 19 (3).]Wilber manages to create a sweeping system for everything in life. He describes our spiritual evolution, and our dominant conceptual concerns: East and West, ancient and modern, individual and collective, physical and metaphysical. Wilber writes in an accessible common-sense style. He deliberately avoids a typical scholarly tone. While not free of some pretense at a monolithic voice, his work promotes rich conceptions of self-reflexiveness, interconnection, spirituality and empathy.Wilber shows how the major theories of biological, psychological, cognitive and spiritual development describe different versions of how to find &quot;the truth.&quot; At the outset, Wilber refers to Douglas Adams's best-selling cult novel Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. We desire final conclusions, just as Adams facetiously proposed the &quot;answer that would completely explain 'God, life, the universe, and everything'&quot; (p. xv). In the novel, that answer was &quot;42,&quot; highlighting the absurdity of seeking such a final answer.Wilber's &quot;answer,&quot; instead, is a framework for connecting evolutionary currents. At first, he uses a Socratic dialogue, beginning with &quot;KW&quot; for Wilber and &quot;Q&quot; for the questioner, be s/he reader, fan, or friend. Initially, this appears somewhat contrived. The text pretends to be an interview, when it is clearly the author's own highly controlled construction. Upon further reading, however, the stylistic device helps Wilber engage the reader in a dialogue.To Wilber, traditions of thought have usually been either &quot;ascending&quot; toward transcendental spirituality, or &quot;descending&quot; to the body, the senses, and sexuality (p. 11). The author suggests that humans must integrate dualities to survive as a species. In fact, we must not merely synthesize but accept the &quot;nonduality&quot; of ascending and descending, mind and body (p. 12).Wilber's first chapter presents a brief summary of the entire book in the voice of the questioner:Q: So we'll start with the story of the Big Bang itself, and then trace out the course of evolution from matter to life to mind. And then, with the emergence of mind, or human consciousness, we'll look at the five or six major epochs of human evolution itself. And all of this is set in the context of spirituality-of what spirituality means, of the various forms that it has historically taken, and the forms that it might take tomorrow. Sound right?KW: Yes, it's sort of a brief history of everything...based on what I call 'orienting generalizations' (p. 17)&quot;Q&quot; is obviously more highly informed than a first-time reader. Wilber uses Q less to ask questions than to help simplify points [the book summarizes the more complex content of Wilber's massive Sex, Ecology, Spirituality (1995)]. The &quot;generalizations&quot; he notes are Kohlberg's and Gilligan's moral stages. &quot;Human moral development goes through at least three broad stages&quot; (p. 17). In brief: before the child is socialized, it is &quot;preconventional,&quot; as it learns the values of society it becomes &quot;conventional,&quot; and eventually it may reflect on its own values critically, becoming increasingly &quot;postconventional.&quot;Wilber goes on to show a number of &quot;tenets&quot; or &quot;patterns that connect.&quot; The first of these is that &quot;reality is composed of whole/parts, or 'holons'&quot; (p. 20). A holon is something that is itself &quot;a whole and simultaneously a part of some other whole&quot; (ibid.). Borrowing from Arthur Koestler, Wilber argues that the world is full of &quot;holarchies,&quot; as opposed to hierarchies. Where a hierarchy typically separates distinct parts, a holarchy consists of both wholes that are parts, and parts that are wholes. For example, an atom is a whole of its own, but also a part of a whole molecule. A whole molecule is a part of a whole cell, and a whole cell is part of a whole organism. As Wilber says, &quot;Time goes on, and today's wholes are tomorrow's parts&quot; (ibid.).Wilber uses the ideas of &quot;depth&quot; and &quot;span&quot; to say that whenever we map a territory, something always gets left out. For instance, as we narrow focus with a microscope, &quot;There are fewer organisms than cells; there are fewer cells than molecules; there are fewer molecules than atoms; there are fewer atoms than quarks. Each has a greater depth, but less span&quot; (p. 34). Similarly, if we move from mysticism and psychology, into biology and physics, the progression gives greater depth of specific detail but less span, embrace, or inclusion of levels of reality (pp. 36-38). These dimensions are neither dependent nor independent, but interdependent.Great shifts in &quot;reality&quot; paradigms were brought by what Wilber calls &quot;the watershed separating the modern and postmodern approaches to knowledge&quot; (p. 58). Postmodernists criticize old paradigms such as &quot;the Enlightenment,... the Newtonian, the Cartesian, the mechanistic, the mirror of nature, the reflection paradigm&quot; (ibid.). In opposition, many postmodernists propose that &quot;all truth is relative and merely culture-bound, there are no universal truths&quot; (pp. 62-63). But as Wilber notes, even Derrida now concedes the elemental point that worldviews are not &quot;'merely constructed' in the sense of totally relative and arbitrary&quot; (p. 62). In Wilber's diagnosis, assertions that &quot;there is no truth in the Kosmos, only those notions that men force on others,&quot; are nihilistic, replacing truth with &quot;the ego of the theorist&quot; (p. 63).As a tool to place different worldviews, Wilber uses &quot;four quadrants of development&quot; (pp. 71-75). The exterior form of development is measured objectively and empirically. The interior dimension is subjective and interpretive, and hence depends on consciousness and introspection. And both interior and exterior occur not just separately but in social or cultural context.Wilber describes how Foucault summarized the &quot;monological madness&quot; that dominated the eighteenth century and Enlightenment notions of the subject: &quot;the subjective and intersubjective domains were thus reduced to empirical studies-I and we were reduced to its- and thus humans became 'objects of information, never subjects in communication'&quot; (p. 269). Treated as objects, people were expected to meet norms of mental health, for instance, while their subjective position in the world was ignored.Wilber says the whole of his morality aims to &quot;protect and promote the greatest depth for the greatest span&quot; (p. 335). He argues we must use these criteria when we make judgments. Although the spirituality risks opacity, the overall effort suggests deeply researched and grounded ways to structure reality. If we as a society need human empathy for multiple perspectives, then the patterns of thought laid out by Wilber provide a system for integrating such perspectives. Distilling messages of vast ranges of thought, Wilber presents highly differentiated worldviews and multiple points of intervention through which we can, if contingently, take action.",

                "review/text": "No, this is not philosophy as it is understood by the grown-ups, although it surely is a dumbed down strand of Hegelianism (what else could it be with such a cute title?). This is a kind of New Age chirping for people who prefer not to strain their brains excessively and to feel well with the least mental expense. How does one earn a reputation in these circles? Easy: by preaching ignorance to the ignorant.Here are a few examples that should serve as a caution to everyone who might otherwise be taken for a ride, as I surely was. If you are a Hegelian, at some point you must introduce the &#65533;Spirit&#65533;. Wilber does it pretty early by discussing evolution. The wing, according to him, is useful only when fully developed &#65533; a half-wing is no good. Such a sophisticated instrument could only have evolved with the help of a supreme agency. This is an argument from a Jehovah Witnesses tract: the real science points out that even a quarter-wing (as well as a quarter-eye) is usually better than none if it gives the animal the slightest edge over the wingless. And it does: somebody should have shown Wilber a flying squirrel.Introducing his theory of &#65533;holons&#65533; Wilber states that matter is infinitely divisible (and compounded). The real science, of course, has discovered otherwise: the string is the smallest element of matter.The discussion of the Big Bang and of what could have &#65533;preceded&#65533; it is altogether laughable. What is missing throughout the book is an awareness that every proposition is worthless unless provable.When mentioning the Axial Age with its saints and prophets, Wilber studiously omits every name connected with the Judeo-Christian tradition. One feels an agenda, but it is never stated explicitly. Sneaky.Last but not least: the whole book is written in the form of a dialog, but the only purpose of the questioner is to suck up to the answerer; he never advances any intelligent objection, never mentions any contrarian authority with the exception of some feminists. This must be the easiest way of philosophical discourse.I must confess that I picked up this book because its main thesis, the poverty of the reductionism, is close to my heart. But I would rather stay with the reductionists as long as they respect my intelligence.",

                "review/text": "This is going to sound petty to most, but it hit me really hard.I saw this book in a store and, having heard a lot about Ken Wilber, I picked it up. Of course, I turned right away to the \"Note to the Reader\" in front. Within seconds I was gasping in disbelief. Here's why.Wilber begins with one of my favorite books, Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Great, I thought, a fellow Hitchhiker's fan! But, he immediately gets it wrong, seriously wrong, several times. I quote:\"In Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a massive supercomputer is designed to give the ultimate answer, the absolute answer, the answer that would completely explain 'God, life, the universe, and everything.'\"Wrong. It's \"Life, the Universe, and Everything\". No mention of God. Wilber continues:\"But the computer takes seven and a half million years to do this, and by the time the computer delivers the answer, everybody has forgotten the question.\"Also wrong. They never knew the question in the first place, and never realized they would have to know the question in order to understand the answer. Wilber goes on:\"Nobody remembers the ultimate question, but the ultimate answer the computer comes up with is: 42. This is amazing! Finally, the ultimate answer. So wonderful is the answer that a contest is held to see if anybody can come up with the question.\"Utterly, utterly wrong. There was no \"contest\"; a second computer was built to find the Ultimate Question. This computer was so large it was frequently mistaken for a planet, and was called the Earth by its inhabitants. Onward:\"Many profound questions are offered, but the final winner is: How many roads must a man walk down?\"Again, wrong. The Earth was destroyed five minutes before it was due to complete its program, and those who had built it decided to come up with a fake question rather than go through the whole thing again. \"How many roads must a man walk down?\" was what they settled on.So, that's four major mistakes in the first two paragraphs, about a book that's known and loved by many, many readers. If Wilber can't be bothered to get this right, then (I asked myself) how trustworthy could he be on a more serious subject such as \"a brief history of everything\"?I put the book down and walked away.",

                "review/text": "For those who don't know (it seems likely based on these reviews that many don't), this is the same Ken Wilber who, not so long ago, was zealously promoting the works of the meglomaniacal cult leader Da Free John, a man who makes the usual claims for his type: to be the greatest avatar of all time, in possession of miraculous powers, and so on. Many of Wilber's ideas, here in Brief History of Everything and all of his later works, are lifted directly from \"Master\" Da, right down to the terminology, but he hardly stops there: he simultaneously manages to believe in literal Hindu-style reincarnation, Freudianism, Zen Buddhism, behaviourism, and any number of other things, dodging their inherent contradictions by taking only what he wants of each.His system is little more than a lot of decoration disguising a stitching-together of Freud and Piaget with Da and Aurobindo; correspondences to what he here and in later works calls \"other quadrants\" are always suggested but never specified. Similarly, his supposedly \"inclusive\" model simply ignores vast areas of the world religious traditions that contradict his theory, such as all of Western esotericism and the nearly universal idea that the proper number of levels of consciousness (his primary theme) is seven.That the seams in this crazy quilt are seemingly invisible to so many is due in part to the overspecialized (mis)education we are provided with; most of Wilber's readers probably aren't familiar enough with the vast territories he covers to realize that he subtly distorts all he touches to shoehorn it into his model. He comes across here and elsewhere as a self-assured filing cabinet stuffed full of data; but he never provides us with a single testable hypothesis, only a belief system consisting of a vague doctrine of inevitable progress. It is this in particular that makes his system so appealing to the academics, corporate CEOs and limosine new-agers that endorse it; it reinforces all their most cherished illusions. This is not to say that his books are without merit; his observations are spot-on when he isn't defending his precious system, and he builds a sort of holistic verbal bridge to places the intellectually or spiritually lazy will find new, but for those serious about transformation it is a bridge to nowhere.",

                "review/text": "The title of this book aptly summarizes messages the author had the intent of conveying. Since online reviews shouldn't ( IMO ) be places of unbridled confessions &amp; ecstatical yes or no self-congratulatory sermons, I'll try to enumerate ( as impersonally as I'm capable of doing this ) the strengths and weaknesses of the book.Strengths1.The author's audacity in pursuing of what he calls &quot;integral studies&quot;. In our fragmented world of clashing Weltanschauungen Wilber tirelessly searches for a unitary vision, the &quot;marriage of East and West&quot;. More-he tries to accomplish the task fathering an entirely new linguistic coordinate system, dispensing with ( and, simultaneously, assimilating ) older, culturally/religiously conditioned vocabulary in an attempt of the comparativist synthesis. A laudable endeavor. 2.His critique of Jungian/Depth psychology and its central tenets, with archetypes being frequently misinterpreted as Platonic ideas/forms and the Collective Unconscious mixed up with Supramental states of, say, Sri Aurobindo's description of Reality. Washburn's criticism of Wilber's supposed misreading of the role of archetypes, in my opinion, doesn't hold water. 3.Wilber's penetrating and frequently funny dissection of contemporary pop-spirituality &amp; other New Age fads ( pathetic Gaia cults which are nothing more than Rousseau in feminist clothing rehashed for the late 20.th century spiritual cosmetics, irrational &amp; dogmatic idolizing of the imagined paradisiacal life in foraging cultures,..)Weaknesses1.With all due respect, Wilber is quite innocent re science, especially physics. His references ( for instance, on Pythagoras' theorem, but also his musings on Quantum Mechanics in other books ) could only put off a professional physicist or a mathematician as an amateurish dabblings of a presumptuous ignoramus ( the contempt Gauss had harbored for Hegel's philosophizing of mathematics springs to mind immediately ). 2.Wilber's central worldview is the non-dualist vision of Reality ( essentially, it is Ch'an/Zen, Tibetan Mahamudra or Trika Shaivism refurbished ), combined with Hegel's evolving Spirit. Yet, the two are hardly reconcilable. You either got: a) the manifest Reality as Illusion ( Advaita Vedanta, Zen,..) which doesn't warrant &quot;perfection&quot; or &quot;evolution&quot;. The world just *is*, without any mythological, let alone rational, explanation or answer to the Leibniz's ultimate question &quot; Why is there anything, instead of nothing ?&quot; b) the manifest Reality as actualization of potential, &quot;hidden&quot; state of the Absolute, radiating/emanating into evolving &amp; ever perfecting forms ( a tad optimistic view on evolution ). In sum, the manifest ( in various levels of manifestation ) Kosmos serves the purpose of enriching &amp; &quot;glorifying&quot; the omnipresent Spirit ( Erigena, Hegel, also Meher Baba in his wilder speculations ). An important subvariant ( Rumi, Neotheosophy ) claims that not only Spirit evolves, but essential human souls ( ruh, pneuma, jivatman ) who are the chief protagonists of &quot;evolutionary enterprise&quot;.) Therefore, I would say that marriage of Shankara's Advaita and Hegel's objective idealism is doomed from the outset. 3.All this inflated verbal jazz is not the substitute for genuine originality. I haven't found true creative spirit &amp; seminal ideas, just the old wine in new ( bells and whistles ) bottles. 4.The last verdict: Wilber's predisposition for non-dual visions of Reality in the vein of Advaita Vedanta or Zen blinds him to the richness and profundity of, also &quot;spiritual&quot;, but more nuanced and &quot;diversified&quot; doctrines a la Hermetic, Rosicrucian, Lurianic Kabbalistic or more &quot;digestable&quot; contemporary revelations like Seth or truly radical &amp; practical, but lucid and all-encompassing transpersonal psychologies like Assagioli's psychosynthesis. Marriage of East &amp; West turned out to be no more than a dissemination of distilled &amp; modernized corpus of intelectually elitist, but esentially marginal non-dual spiritual doctrines of East and Southeast Asia.",

It combines a lofty and &quot;abstract&quot; element with one that is profound and &quot;concrete,&quot; encompassing the highest as well as the deepest faculties of man. But Schuon is above all a realist, and thus the horizontal plane of what is human-and even all too human-necessarily finds an important place in his writings.This book brings together some of his earliest articles with the last of those belonging to his metaphysical prose works. Among the latter, &quot;Between East and West&quot; is a particularly interesting description of the flaws as well as the positive characteristics of the &quot;average mentality&quot; found among modern Orientals and Occidentals and their spiritual consequences. In a general way, Easterners are more sensitive to the symbolism or the spiritual intention of things than to the &quot;objective facts&quot; which are more convincing for Westerners. Schuon sets forth with precision and finesse how this contrast or oscillation between &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;reason&quot; shows itself not only among different groups of humanity but also within our individual souls.One of the singular features of Schuon's perspective-and of a jnanic viewpoint in general-is the absence of a denominational zeal that wishes to convert or a moralizing approach that tends to elevate a particular human style to the level of a goal in itself. Whether one experiences this as a shock or as a relief, Schuon unwaveringly looks at the essential nature of things in all their degrees and modalities. And the immutable reference point is always the sense of the sacred. Reality is sacred, therefore man is a theophany or he lives below himself-in his thoughts, in his actions, in his sentiments and imagination: &quot;...What is `true' is what opens the door towards the Truth at once transcendent and immanent... There is the symbol and there is the `fact': now the understood symbol is worth infinitely more than the misunderstood fact.&quot;It is striking to find the same &quot;faith-reason&quot; or &quot;symbol-fact&quot; polarity in the chapter &quot;Intellectuality and Civilization,&quot; written in the 1940's, at the beginning of the Schuon opus. Everyone can agree that intelligence is preferable to stupidity, just as truth is superior to error and illusion. The difficulty is that the modern definition of intelligence tends to limit it, either by specializing it into a kind of cerebral virtuosity or by flattening it into mere reason or, worse yet, the infra-reason of existentialism. Thus, as Schuon points out, to its great harm, today's culture ignores the cosmic laws that have always governed humanity. It replaces them with either an &quot;idealism&quot; or a &quot;realism,&quot; both misconceived. &quot;The first will always be above collective human possibilities, and the second altogether below them.&quot;Modern man suffers both individually and collectively from the pervasive illness of relativism. Then, precisely because of his malady, he bitterly rails against centuries of saints, sages and pious men before him. The rejection of the religious traditions goes hand in hand with the loss of what Schuon terms &quot;integral intelligence,&quot; one that is proportioned to total Truth, which is necessarily eternal and spiritual. To read Schuon is to be reminded that this total Truth is always at hand, for those who seek it with the eye of the heart.",

It is a lesser tool for a lesser world. The Eye of the Heart is that two-way lens by which we Know the Creator, and by which the Creator Knows us. It is our center by which we are joined by the vertical spiritual axis with our Source._Schuon mentions that we will probably never know whether there is a historical connection between the \"Eye of the Heart\" teachings of Plotinian Doctrine, Augustinian Doctrine, and Sufic Doctrine. He also points out that it is unimportant. This is part of the perennial philosophy, the golden chain that has always existed. Who received it first is irrelevant. It predated all three schools._In his perceptive introduction Huston Smith admits that at first he found Schuon to be somewhat difficult to penetrate- but he persisted.

                "review/text": "I do not have this book at present, thus I can only write what I remember.Overall I would say that anyone interested in history, particularly milleniarism, should read/buy &quot;The Great Year.&quot; The book is an engaging, comprehensive survery of milleniarism along with a great deal of history to boot.&quot;The Great Year&quot; and &quot;The Great Week&quot; are views of history that have been accepted by many cultures/religions - Hebrews, Christians, Platonists, etc. According to this view, history is predetermined and fulfills itself in phases of various lengths. In the Hebrew book of Jubilees a &quot;year&quot; is 49 years, for example. In another culture a 4-phase historical cycle may involve completely different time scales. The Hebrews tended to see their &quot;Great Year&quot; cycles as successive renewals with God's covenant through prophets like Moses, with alternating cycles where the covenant is broken and people suffer, the explanation given as not following God's laws. Everyone is certainly familiar with how Christians believe their destiny will be fulfilled!The author of &quot;The Great Year&quot; argues that history is not predetermined, that human behavior and events are not so predictable, and that historians often bias their accounts using various filters, especially the theory that history and humanity are always progressing.Very broadly speaking, what the author seeks to accomplish in this very large survey are three things: 1) To define &quot;The Great Year&quot; concept and pinpoint how and when it manifested itself in various cultures. Millenarian movements in Christianity and other cultures are discussed thoroughly. Some readers may be surprised at how widespread and pervasive milleniarism has been over time in many cultures and religions. 2) To show that historians who view history in terms of progress are in error. Karl Popper wrote a book called &quot;The Poverty of Historicism&quot; that Campion and others have cited to show that historical accounts are often biased by false preconceptions. 3) To demonstrate that a number of currents in history, such as Marxism, are actually millenarian movements themselves, describing history in their own terms of fulfillment of their predetermined goals.I feel that the author suceeds very well with these aims. I was particularly impressed with his insight in observing that adherents of the more modern movements such as Marxism and Nazism indeed act exactly like those who claim that a select group of people will be &quot;saved&quot; because they believe in a &quot;Saviour,&quot; that history is following their version of a predetermined conclusion.In the end, however, I found parts of this otherwise excellent book unsatisfactory because the author, while accurately depicting the fallacies of other historical views, himself falls into what I would call the trap of reason, that reason and material &quot;proof&quot; are the sole arbiters of &quot;truth.&quot;In the first part of the book Mr. Campion critisizes Jung for the latter's writings which stated that excessive materialism had corrupted mankind and made it more bellicose, hence 2 world wars in an era of great technological progress. He claims that there is no &quot;proof.&quot; It's a shame that Dr. Jung can't defend himself, as I'm certain he could. But let me say, if the lack of spiritual values - compassion, tolerance, humility, a bond with something Divine, etc., which have in no way kept up with our material development in this century - is not one of the major causes of our almost total preoccupation with materialism, then we might as well discard the timeless teachings of many teachers, theologians, and others, who have attempted to bring some civility and purpose into this often Godless, corrupted world. Personally I am not willing to do this.I also found the author's attack on &quot;New Age&quot; thinkers, like Helen Blavatsky and others, only too typical of the trite criticisms of materialistic thinkers. I even checked out one of his sources, who wrote a trilogy debunking Blavatsky and others (I can't remember the author's name), and parts of the 2 books I perused were in my opinion sadly failed attempts to attack the messangers while not attempting to take on the far more difficult and important task of evaluating their messages. Not at all surprising, for how can we &quot;prove&quot; that there is a God, or that there are Masters of Wisdom, karma, reincarnation, etc., which would point to some spiritual meaning for life? There are those who try to prove these things, even doctors, scientists, etc., but from what I could tell from this book, to Mr. Campion and his sources it's doubtful that any proof would ever suffice. To me a purely materialistic reading of history, where there is no ultimate Purpose and meaning - which I would claim can be pursued by trying to grow spiritually, often through multiple physical incarnations - is itself in one important sense lacking in purpose.",

                "review/text": "Having read Bourdieu's book, and then the comments here, I find the most revealing response is the one by Brad Delong. Indeed, Delong's comments are almost a textbook case of everything that's wrong with the neoliberal paradigm of economic rationalism that Bourdieu's book so powerfully decries. It's helpful, though, to take Delong's points one by one --- albeit in no particular order --- and contrast them with what Bourdieu actually says.First, the notion that &quot;Acts&quot; is a &quot;mosaic&quot; and, as such, omits &quot;large and important pieces of the picture&quot; (Delong later claims that Bourdieu's &quot;position&quot; is less than &quot;coherent&quot;). That the book is an incomplete &quot;mosaic&quot; is true enough, but the implication that this amounts to a flawed set of arguments is unsupported by Delong. Though some of Bourdieu's mini-essays and speeches appear occasionally to wander from his main thesis, in reality, of the sixteen items in this book, all but two are concerned, directly or indirectly, with Bourdieu's &quot;resistance&quot; to the ideas and policies subsumed under the doctrine of &quot;neoliberalism.&quot; In fact, it's all summed up in the second part of his title: &quot;Against the Tyranny of the Market.&quot;Neoliberalism is the most pervasive economic doctrine today bolstering the &quot;tyranny of the market&quot; in its advocacy of privatization, exportation of capital to foreign countries (for the exploitation of cheap resources and low-wage workers), the bailing out of Wall Street investors with middle-class tax money, and the removal of legal restraints upon capital which, along with depredations on the working class, allows corporations to pollute the environment with near impunity. It's almost laughable, in fact, to see Delong list among his &quot;credentials&quot; his former tutelage under Lawrence Summers, among whose famous statements are the following from 1991:&quot;I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that.... I've always thought that underpopulated countries in Africa are vastly under polluted; their air quality is vastly inefficiently low compared to Los Angeles or Mexico City.&quot;Summers, of course, later defended these statements as &quot;ironic,&quot; but nearly everything else he's advocated proves the opposite.Ergo, it's hardly surprising that a fervent apostle of neoliberal economics like Delong should have problems with Bourdieu. He attempts an affable rejoinder, granting Bourdieu's &quot;excellent&quot; points, but this sort of amiability seems oddly similar to the kind of bonhomie extended at business conferences to token liberals like Jesse Jackson. In other words, it's easy to be amiable when you're one of the main beneficiaries of the doctrines being denounced, especially when there's no foreseeable danger that said doctrines will be supplanted by &quot;mere&quot; verbal renunciation.Delong's main points are two. First, after characterizing Bourdieu as a &quot;friend,&quot; then backtracking to an &quot;ally,&quot; he resigns himself ultimately to &quot;someone who would be [i.e., an ally or friend] if he pushed his analysis just a little bit deeper, and made his position a little more coherent.&quot;Actually, Bourdieu's position is about as &quot;coherent&quot; as one could hope for, especially given the varied circumstances under which these articles were written, and they are also as &quot;deep&quot; as anything spewed up by the neoliberal camp. But this &quot;position&quot; is more than a distrust of &quot;intellectuals&quot;: it's a critique of a particular form of &quot;mathematical&quot; rationalism appropriated by the economics profession which, in its provinciality, attempts to reduce policy to formulae, and to simultaneously divorce these mathematical calculations from social consequences. In other words, what Bourdieu is denouncing is a prevailing economic policy that takes place in a moral vacuum, perhaps best summed up by the famous claim of Milton Friedman that companies have no &quot;responsibility&quot; other than those to their shareholders for the maximization of profit. Starting from this major premise of economic isolationism, myriad evils follow.Delong's claim that Bourdieu needs to go &quot;deeper&quot; (implicitly, to see the error of his ways) is also a familiar tactic of right-wing sciolists. It's an easy tactic to see through, especially when the tactician fails to present any evidence to back himself up. If Delong has gone &quot;deeper&quot; than Bourdieu into these matters, the obvious questions is why he fails to share the benefit of his depth. An old trick, and here again former examples come to mind, like the one the media orchestrated in the mid-90's, when pollsters were claiming that people disliked the &quot;Contract With America&quot; until it was &quot;explained&quot; to them (we can pretty well guess who the &quot;explainers&quot; were), at which point they seemed magically converted to the church of Mammon.Delong's other point relates to Bourdieu's classification of representatives of the welfare state (presumably as nothing more than a &quot;trace&quot;). &quot;That the main business of the late-twentieth century state is social insurance is an important fact,&quot; counters Delong, in the process failing to note (1) that he's uttering a tautology, (2) that Bourdieu is not defending the welfare state against leftwingers, but against rightwingers, and (3) that Bourdieu's use of &quot;trace&quot; in this context is a commentary on the fact that in all the advanced industrial economies, the welfare state is, as a direct result of neoliberal policies, no more than a &quot;trace&quot; of what it was during the bulk of the post-war period.In other words, from what little I can see of Delong's &quot;intellectual position,&quot; he needs to go &quot;deeper&quot; into Bourdieu.",

Anyone who has followed M. Bourdieu's political life in relation to his theories might have previously been suprised by this apparent incongruity, but I was delighted to find that this little book contains enough thoughtful application of theory to fan the flames of dissidence and keep alive the hopes for a more accountable, 'rational' society. Bourdieu is not always right (naturally) and he does have a clear sense of his own importance in the French intellectual field, but to be perfectly honest, when the speaker is this informed and capable a little leeway can be granted. An excellent book, very readable and up-to-date, but not - it is perhaps worth noting - any sort of introduction to Bourdieu's dense theories, more a treasure trove of his shoot-from-the-hip polemics.",

As Bourdieu writes, his role as an intellectual is to \"critique...the [false] representations continuously produced and propagated by the dominant groups and their lackeys in the media\" (pg. 66) in order to expose the restorative nature (ie laissez-faire economics) of the neoliberal agenda. On the other hand, it is the role of the neoliberal pseudo-intellectual to \"contribute to the maintenance of the symbolic order which is the condition of the functioning of the economic order\" (pg. 82).Knowing full well that \"a 'turncoat' activist does more harm than ten opponents\" (pg. 6), Delong would like nothing better than to coopt Bourdieu to further the neoliberal agenda.But of course Bourdieu will have none of that. Bourdieu's reasoned arguments for dignity and human rights in \"Acts of Resistance\" will necessarilly stand in the way of the \"accountant's view of the world\" (pg. 105) that Delong subscribes to.In a world where corporate media favors conservative views, it is refreshing to read Bourdieu's intelligent yet sometimes bare-knuckled defense of people and society. Understanding both the value of high human cultural achievement and the threat of unchecked greed, Bourdieu spares no quarters when exposing those who aim to fill their pockets at the expense of the greater good.\"Acts of Resistance\" will help fix your moral compass and remind you that, in the end, it is people that matter most.

                "review/text": "With his characteristic wit, humour, digression and depth, Robert Ferrar Capon has delivered another book centred about grace. In his always inimitable way, Capon is able to present an old theme in a new way, using various writing styles and techniques to get his point across.Having read &quot;From noon to Three&quot; and this book, clearly Capon wants to emphasize - no, pound into your head - the idea that God has done it all, that grace is free, that God simply does not see our sin anymore. He must have quoted the verse &quot;there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&quot; and it is the entire world who is in Christ, and we are in Him. This is part of the mystery.As a pastoral tool Capon's perspective is refreshing and greatly needed in our works-loving, bookkeeping Church. Capon writes like a prophet, warning us that we fall too easily into the danger of thinking we have to &quot;do&quot; something. I also enjoyed his discussion of ways that we can view the resurrection. This was an education and well thought-out section of the book.Of course, I have a &quot;but&quot;....I was continually uncomfortable with Capon's approach which, while he claims is theological, often plays fast and loose with the Bible. He was unconvincing in his analysis of the sheep and the goats parable. Moreover, I did not appreciate his several jabs at Bonheoffer, nor his implication that the &quot;medieval&quot; theology of Luther and Calvin, qua medieval theology, was unacceptable. Capon claims that, instead, he is more &quot;biblical&quot; - a term too often bandied about these days.He speaks near the end of ways that our lives need to be, not acceptable to, but &quot;congruent&quot; to the mystery of Christ. And this would seem to me to mean that congruent should be biblical, but no....instead it is okay to practice astrology as if it gave us even the &quot;weather&quot; of things. Meanwhile the bible specifically indicates that it is not a godly practice. How is it then congruent that his wife is a practicing professional astrologer? No, I do not &quot;condemn&quot; her for it, only to question how he can make this claim.Given that Luther has expounded so well on the grace of God, I think Capon takes it too far somehow and goes somewhere that is not warranted. Now, if he read this, he would think that I was falling back into &quot;medieval&quot; or &quot;works&quot; theology. No, I just am not convinced that what he argues is fully biblical. It's not that I want grace to cost anything, just that I think he is not convincing.",

It is definitely in his favor that he takes a biblical approach, patiently explaining why the Bible, in his view, teaches that the whole world is in Christ, and therefore the whole world will be saved. This is the \"mystery of Christ\" to which he refers. The only ones who will not enter into heaven will be those who pointedly reject the free grace of God, which the author believes will be continually offered even after death.Capon loves Jesus' parables (he has written three books on them, one of which I have read), and draws much of his theology from those parables. Some of the parables presented in this book (the Sheep and the Goats, for example) are interpreted in the light of Capon's universalism, which results in some novel interpretations. Not that that's always a bad thing, indeed, his interpretation of the parable of the Ten Virgins is quite enlightening. Just the fact that the \"wise\" virgins are portrayed as being selfish and snippy show the reversal in the Kingdom of the good and the bad, and that nothing is received on merit, all on grace.I don't give this book a relatively low rating because I'm anti-univeralist (I don't happen to be a universalist, although I'm always open to change), but because I have some issues with certain things in the book that just cannot be easily resolved. Capon gives far too much value to astrology, and without much explanation except for the fact that his wife is a professional astrologer. It has always been my conviction that astrology is anti-Christian and anti-intellectual (in simpler terms, both Satanic and a crock), and those who engage in it are either deceived or are spiritual flim-flam artists. Anyone who deems astrology acceptable and then tries to teach me Christian theology suffers a severe credibility problem. Another stumbling-block is that the author doesn't seem to take sin very seriously. That problem is addressed in the book, but not in a very convincing manner. Some things that, from a biblical standpoint, are indeed sin are deemed a non-sin in this book (sprecifically homosexuality).I enjoyed the format of the book, alternating between one-on-one counseling sessions or conversations and group discussion of those situations. One of the discussion participants fits my profile really well. That participant, while he learned a lot, still had reservations at the end. That is my position as well.",

A rigorous Paulinist, Capon is at least half right--a very good score for a theologian!&quot; I tend to agree--Father Capon is at least half right. He focuses on grace as a free gift to such an extent that he loses the transformative aspect of Christianity almost completely. As long as you have faith/trust/believe then you're home free! As God has already done away with the consequences of all sin, all guilt, in Jesus' death and resurrection, no one is condemned any longer. Therefore, the only people who will be in hell are those who reject the free gift of grace. They will not be there for their sins. I agree, but see sin as the blocking off of God's grace. By sin I don't mean the mistakes and stumbles we make along the way, but pure out-right nastiness.Capon is so adamant about the fact that no works can earn grace and that no sin can separate you from God's love and forgiveness, that he leaves one thinking you can go on doing whatever you like as long as you accept God's grace. Once again, I agree, but apparently have a different understanding of what accepting God's grace means. To accept God's grace is to let his love and grace flow through you. It's transformative. You can't be nasty when God's love is flowing through you, and when you are, you're cutting off the flow. When God's love is flowing through you, you *can* do whatever you like--it's just that you want like to do anything nasty. ;)Sin blocks one's acceptance of grace--its still there, but you can't see it. God never stops loving or forgiving, but if you blind your vision by clouding it over with sin, you can't see the grace all around you. Its not that &quot;works&quot; are necessary to accept God's grace through faith, but that they naturally flow from you as a result of that acceptance. &quot;Faith without works is dead&quot; as St. James wrote. In Capon's theology, you apparently don't have to follow Jesus to be a follower of Jesus. You don't have to &quot;take up your cross&quot;--just believe that Jesus did.Near the very end of the book Capon does add that &quot;I myself take sin very seriously. As far as I'm concerned, it's what messes up my life, so anything I can do to resist it will make me, and those around me, a lot happier than we presently are.&quot; That, to me, is the key to the Christian life. Capon, however, simply sees it as an option of the Christian life, not it's point. While I don't think God will judge us for our sins, I do think the clouding of our vision caused by our sin is what puts us in hell--now and later.I very much agree with Capon's rejection of &quot;transactionalism&quot;, however, and think he has some wonderful things to say about the &quot;Mystery&quot; of Christ that is everywhere present. I agree with him that &quot;what God revealed in Jesus was his Incarnation in the whole world.&quot; He has a panentheistic understanding of God's Incarnation, seeing the world in God and God in the world, and Jesus as a sacrament and revelation of that Incarnation.I give the book four stars, however, not because I agree with all of Capon's theology, but because his theology makes you think and brings up some very good points. Plus I found the book to be an enjoyable read and like Capon's sense of humour. :) So it's recommended, with reservations.",

                "review/text": "David Wells' \"Losing Our Virtue\" is a stinging assault on the idolatrous nature of postmodern man. Chock full of astute observations about the utter lack of morality within American popular culture and the creeping destruction of Christianity caused by compromises with that culture, this book is a clarion call to intelligent people who understand that only through the death of self and utter submission to the God of the Christian Bible can the we hold out hope for the future.Prophetic in its intensity (though similar arguments were voiced by Francis Schaeffer long before Wells), \"Losing Our Virtue\" discusses how the combination of deconstructionist theology and psychology at the nascence of the 20th century brought us to the point that we call black white and white black. He outlines the rise of self at the expense of traditional Christian views of God, sin, and the cross of Christ, showing how modern culture now exists in a moral vacuum that has in its brazenness supposedly killed God and therefore any guilt that may arise from acknowledging that He transcends us. With self now ensconced as the moral center, absolute truth and morality are jettisoned in favor of each person being his own moral center. That this can only breed relativism and the eventual destruction of all things moral, is a point well covered in the book.In some ways, perhaps too well covered. The first few chapters and the last chapter are brilliant. At the cost of a star, though, the middle sags as Wells builds his arguments. The problem lies in beating the points along his path to his conclusion to death. This book probably could have been cut down to 120 pages and would have made its point more efficiently. Metaphorically, you can kill the vampire with an effective stake through the heart. You don't have to then stuff it with garlic, douse it in \"holy water\", and bury it in a silver coffin lined with crucifixes under a running stream.The section on the differences between \"Guilt\" and \"Shame\" was also confusing since Wells mixed conflicting viewpoints and counterpoints together, making it hard to tell exactly what his point was until the very end of the section. Again, a bit better editing would have made the book a smoother read.This is an intellectually challenging book that demands close attention. And despite the author's attempt to end on a more upbeat note, it is hard to close this book and think any other outcome than the utter corruption of the entire world and most of Christendom is a foregone conclusion. Hopefully, readers will come away with a burning desire to make a difference rather than conceding that all is lost.",

First, he distinguishes between two &quot;kinds&quot; of evangelicalism. &quot;Classic&quot; evangelicalism, which Wells explains is God centered, truth centered and morally focused. &quot;Postmodern&quot; evangelicalism is essentially centered in the self, and theraputically focused. The only problem with these two definitions is that in the real world many traditionalized &quot;classic&quot; churches fit Wells &quot;postmodern&quot; definition, and visaversa. At the end Wells promised to provide an apologetic &quot;fitted to the circumstances of the postmodern world.&quot; In reality the apologetic was basically just stuck in the institutionalized Christendom paradigm. The apologetic makes sense to the traditionalized church, but would not be convincing to a postmodern &quot;pre-Christian seeker.&quot; And this is the whole point of the church to help people say &quot;yes&quot; to God and develop them into fully devoted followers of Jesus. If &quot;our&quot; apologetics are unintelligable to postmoderns how does that help them to meet and get to know Christ?",

        "description": "\"Moving, deeply introspective and honest\" (Publishers Weekly) reflections on exile and memory from five award-winning authors. All of the authors in Letters of Transit have written award-winning works on exile, home, and memory, using the written word as a tool for revisiting their old homes or fashioning new ones. Now in paperback are five newly commissioned essays offering moving distillations of their most important thinking on these themes. Andre Aciman traces his migrations and compares his own transience with the uprootedness of many moderns. Eva Hoffman examines the crucial role of language and what happens when your first one is lost. Edward Said defends his conflicting political and cultural allegiances. Novelist Bharati Mukherjee explores her own struggle with assimilation. Finally, Charles Simic remembers his thwarted attempts at \"fitting in\" in America.",

                "review/text": "&quot;Letters of Transit&quot; is a collection of five essays originally presented, in somewhat different form, as lectures sponsored by the New York Public Library from November, 1997, through February, 1998. Andre Aciman, the editor and author of both the Foreward (&quot;Permanent Transients&quot;) and the first of the essays (&quot;Shadow City&quot;), focuses on the theme of being an &quot;exile&quot; (as opposed to being an &quot;expatriate&quot; or a &quot;refugee&quot; or an &quot;emigre&quot;). Aciman suggests, in his Foreward, that &quot;[w]hat makes exile the pernicious thing it is is not really the state of being away, as much as the impossibility of ever not being away.&quot; He goes on to elaborate, in his ensuing essay, that the exile is not just someone &quot;who has lost his home; it is someone who can't find another, who can't think of another.&quot; Aciman, impressionistically explores the way in which living in a new city (New York) can vividly reincarnate the memories of cities in which the exile has lived previously (the &quot;shadow cities&quot; of his title). Aciman's essay is fascinating, perceptive and insightful; it is a wonderful short piece which illustrates why his much-praised memoir, &quot;Out of Egypt&quot;, has become a minor classic of the genre.Similarly, Bharati Mukherjee's essay, &quot;Imagining Homelands&quot;, provides thoughtful elaborations on the nuances and connotations of the words &quot;expatriate&quot;, &quot;exile&quot; and &quot;immigrant&quot;; she draws fine and interesting distinctions among these words and carefully entwines these distinctions with an elaboration of her own life experiences.The strongest essays in this collection, however, are those of Eva Hoffman, Edward Said and Charles Simic. All three of these writers provide classic insights into the experience of &quot;exile, identity, language, and loss&quot; which are worth careful thought and consideration. All three suggest (as does Mukherjee when she describes herself as an &quot;integrationist&quot; and a &quot;mongrelizer&quot;) that the exile can only ultimately be redeemed by rejecting irrational devotion to the narrow and myopic tribalism of nation, ethnicity, religion, and ideology which so often encumbers the exile community; that redemption comes only through freedom, reason and syncretism. Thus, Simic writes, in concluding his essay, &quot;Refugees&quot;, that the poet &quot;is a member of that minority that refuses to be part of any official minority, because a poet knows what it is to belong among those walking in broad daylight, as well as among those hiding behind closed doors.&quot;Hoffman's essay, &quot;The New Nomads&quot;, is clearly the best of this collection. She carefully delineates the universality of the exilic experience, an experience which can be found in the Ur-text of Adam and Eve's exile from the Garden of Eden. She then discusses the way in which exile can magnify the impulse to &quot;memorialize&quot; the past. The result, she suggests, is that exile distorts the vision of the past, tending to make it an idealized &quot;mythic, static realm&quot; which forever impedes the ability to deal with the present (what Hoffman perceptively characterizes as the &quot;rigidity of the exilic posture&quot;). She then provides an interesting discussion of A.B. Yehoshua's provocative essay, &quot;Exile as Neurotic Solution&quot;, wherein he postulated that there were many opportunities for the Jews (prior to the creation of the modern State of Israel) to settle in Palestine more easily than in countries where they had chosen to live, but it was the one location they avoided. In Hoffman's words, &quot;[i]t was as if they were afraid precisely of reaching their promised land and the responsibilities and conflicts involved in turning the mythical Israel into an actual, ordinary home.&quot; The ultimate result of the &quot;memorialization&quot; of the past and the &quot;rigidity of the exilic posture&quot; is that exile communities often cannot function in the locus of the larger society; rather, they conceive of themselves as perpetually &quot;Other&quot;.Edward Said's essay, &quot;No Reconciliation Allowed&quot;, describes the dislocation of the exile in vivid terms: &quot;a Palestinian going to school in Egypt, with an English first name, an American passport, and no certain identity at all.&quot; Thus, he finds himself in a secondary school where only English is permitted to be spoken, even though none of the students is a native speaker of English. While his entire educational experience is Anglocentric in the extreme, he is also trained to understand he is a &quot;Non-European Other&quot;, someone who can never aspire to being British in any true sense of the word. While Said has been criticized recently for allegedly misrepresenting his past, he is quite forthcoming in this essay in acknowledging his admiration for &quot;self-invention&quot;. In some sense, Said's essay and the narrative of his life reflects his theory, specifically the notion that we can (and do) use language instrumentally to construct social realities (in this case the reality of his life).While somewhat uneven, as all collections are, &quot;Letters of Transit&quot; ultimately provides a rich, varied and deeply insightful range of readings on what it means to be an exile.",

A mother whose five-year-old boy has leukemia. Two doctors. An atheist haunted by his past and a brilliant young oncologist that places all her hope in the power of modern medicine. A blind pastor whose son hasn't spoken a single word in thirty-eight years. But the minister sees by faith. He knows there are answers and believes that someone who cares is watching-someone with a greater purpose. Yet there is something he doesn't know... that none of them know. In the midst of the ordinary and the devastat- ing, there is a reason these lives will be changed forever. Lightning is about to strike. The Reason opens with a thunderbolt and never lets up as it introduces us to everyday characters who are wrestling with questions: Where is God when bad things happen?

My issue with Gewirth is that I do not believe his argument can ever transcend the self-orientated prudentiality of his &quot;dialectically necessary&quot; method of justification.Does morality truly spring from prudential concern?Rescher argues against Gewirth's strategy more concisely than I could.&quot;At this point, someone might offer the following objection:---------------------- You are quite right to insist that a prudential rationale for morality does not provide for the deontic force of moral claims. But what it can (and presumably does) accomplish is to establish that we a re rationally well advised to deem ourselves (and others) to be morally obligated in the full-blooded-duty-oriented sense of the term. That is, it can show that we are prudentially bound to believe in the deontic force of morality. -----------------------------However, this tactic still cannot provide a satisfactory rationale for authentic morality. It yields no more than a sham morality, because it does not go to show that we ever actually are obligated to moral action, only that we are prudentially well-advised to think ourselves (and others) to be so obligated . . . &quot; (Rescher, _Objectivity_, pp. 151-154).To get to the bottom of the issue, even if I, as a prospective purposive agent, realize that I have a right to claim goods necessary to my agency,_and_ that in this respect I am not different from other prospective purposive agents, and that they as well may make the same rights claims, at no point does the dialectically necessary method require that I morally respect the claims of others in the same way that I respect my own prudential right claims.",

                "review/text": "In this scintillating work, Alan Gewirth attempts an extremely difficult task: deriving a substantive moral principle from nothing more than the rational requirement of consistency/universality. The result, which he calls the Principle of Generic Consistency, is a moral requirement to act in such a way as to take into account the &quot;generic rights&quot; of all who are affected by our actions, these &quot;generic rights&quot; including _both_ libertarian negative rights against interference _and_ positive rights to certain essentials required for well-being.Gewirth tries to steer a middle course between the extremes of &quot;libertarianism&quot; and &quot;socialism,&quot; and as a libertarian myself I must say that he is not always successful; my own opinion is that his strictly political discussion (on e.g. the legitimacy of taxation and the &quot;supportive state&quot;) fails to make some crucially important distinctions. But his _moral_ arguments are generally quite compelling all the same. And I heartily endorse, at least in spirit, his account of the &quot;duty to rescue&quot; on which some of his political conclusions are based: under certain circumstances, if one can help to &quot;rescue&quot; someone else whose life is at risk, with no &quot;comparable cost&quot; to oneself, then one is morally obliged to do so. (In my own view, this is so obviously rational that I wouldn't even bother calling it a &quot;duty&quot;; surely it is what any sane and benevolent person would do. Which, really, is Gewirth's point, although he makes it deontologically rather than teleologically.)In short, this work on ethical rationalism is well worth reading even for those who, like me, may disagree with some of Gewirth's strictly political conclusions. And even those conclusions fare well enough if we may take the liberty(!) of allowing nongovernmental social institutions to fulfill the undoubtedly legitimate functions Gewirth unnecessarily assigns to the &quot;state.&quot;",

What makes _Reason and Morality_ such an impressive work is its extraordinarily conscientious and rigorous argumentation. Indeed, Gewirth attempts to respond to almost every conceivable objection that anyone could possibly offer against his theory; and just when you think no more objections could possibly be lobbed at it, he answers six or seven more! (Anyone who's read it will know I'm not exaggerating.)

                "review/text": "This is an adequate Wagner biography. Though Ronald Taylor's &quot;Wagner&quot;, and Barry Millington's Wagner biography (sold on this site) are both better.Where Gutman's book falls down is in his tenditious interpretations of &quot;the mind and music&quot;.Here are two examples.1 There is a misprint in Act 1 of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;: Isolde says that she spared Tristan's life (after she recognised the mortally wounded Tristan as the man who killed her husband) only so that the man who next won her (Isolde) could kill Tristan. The correct sense is obvious from the context. However, a misprint in the text has &quot;ihn&quot;, not &quot;ihm&quot;. With &quot;ihn&quot;, Isolde seems to say that she spared Tristan's life so that the man who won _him_, not her, could kill him.There are three possible interpretations, here: (a) There is a misprint, not too surprising in a long sentence with complicated syntax. Gutman even acknowledges that Wagner seldom bothered to correct misprints once they'd got into print;(b) Isolde means to insult Tristan, calling him a woman, or homosexual, who could be &quot;won&quot; by another man; or(c) There is an entire subplot, involving a homosexual triangle between Tristan, his uncle King Mark, and his treacherous &quot;friend&quot; Melot, established before Isolde arrived, and which is not referred to in Wagner's text or music anywhere except for this one &quot;n&quot; instead of an &quot;m&quot;: &quot;ihn&quot; instead of &quot;ihm&quot;.Of these three options, (a) is overwhelmingly most likely, followed very distantly by (b), while (c) is beyond far-fetched, and merely silly. Gutman chooses (c), an example of the kind of decision, when evaluating evidence, that recurs throughout his book.Another example involves the HG Wells Literary Time Machine. Gutman wants to read &quot;Parsifal&quot; as a racist, antisemitic parable. To do this he has to ignore Wagner's text and substitute a plot of his own. In Wagner's &quot;Parsifal&quot;, Amfortas is wounded by the Spear that pierced Christ in the side, when he (Christ) was on the cross. This contact with Jesus' divine blood, through the agency of the Spear, causes Amfortas permanent agony; as a mere sinner he cannot cope with this contact with the Divine.In Gutman's &quot;Parsifal&quot; Amfortas is actually injured by sexual contact with a woman called Kundry, and his wound won't close because of the mix of Amfortas' superior and Kundry's inferior blood. Problems with this include:(1) the wound was dealt by a Spear, not by sexual contact - because of an interruption there was no sexual contact anyway;(2) Amfortas specifically says his problem is his inability to cope with the contact, through the wound, with the Divine;(3) At the climax of the opera, Amfortas' wound is healed &quot;by the Spear that caused it&quot;;(4) Kundry is a sinner, like Amfortas, but there's no suggestion that she has &quot;inferior blood&quot;, or (which is what Gutman is really getting at) that she is supposed to be a Jewish character. In Act II, Klingsor points out that in one of Kundry's past lives she was Gunndryggia, a Valkyrie (just like Bru:nnhilde!) If Gutman is suggesting that Kundry and her sisters, the Valkyries, are supposed to be Jewish characters, and antisemitic caricatures at that, that could perhaps lead to an interesting re-reading of the &quot;Ring&quot;.But Wagner's text makes it clear that Kundry has been many people in many lives, and does not represent any particular racial identity. And she's always been the most faithful, enduring and bravest of the Grail's servants, except when under Klingsor's enchantment; though a sinner, she is nowhere presented as &quot;inferior&quot;. The concept of &quot;inferior and superior blood&quot; absolutely does not occur in &quot;Parsifal&quot;. It is not there in the text, implied in the plot, or in the music.Gutman, however, wants to present &quot;Parsifal&quot; as a proto-Nazi work, and even describes the Grail knights as a &quot;homosexual SS order&quot;. We'll leave aside Gutman's use of slightly far-fetched &quot;discoveries&quot; of homosexual content as a stick with which to beat Wagner; homophobia was more acceptable in 1968, when Gutman's book was written, than it is now.What's more interesting is Gutman's Time Machine. To back his case for his reading of &quot;Parsifal&quot;, Gutman would like to have Wagner influenced by the racist philosopher Gobineau. If Gobineau had influenced &quot;Parsifal&quot;, that would indeed be in a racist direction. Unfortunately, Wagner wrote his first draft of &quot;Parsifal&quot; in 1857, including much of the most important dialogue; and finished the complete draft of the drama in 1877. We know from Cosima's Diaries that Wagner first read Gobineau in 1881, four years after he finished the text of &quot;Parsifal&quot;. Gutman's reading of Gobineau into &quot;Parsifal&quot; involves time travel. It's an odd mistake, given how often Gutman cites Cosima's Diaries. How could he not know this?Anyway, Gutman tends to use any old device, any old how, to try to &quot;prove&quot; some of his points. And that's not a respectable procedure, and makes the book unreliable in many respects.Laon",

                "review/text": "I've just re-read this book, after first reviewing it over two years ago. I noted Gutman's unreliability then, but on re-reading I can only report that my opinion of Gutman has fallen further. I originally awarded it two stars; I now think that was generous.This book is more careless of source material than any book has right to be, but it's not ordinary carelessness. All errors and misstatements happen to support Gutman's case for a proto-Nazi Wagner. When a book's errors all support one thesis, that pattern must raise questions not just of competence but also of integrity.For example Gutman claims Wagner was &quot;sympathetic&quot; to proto-Nazi Bernhard F&ouml;rster's attempted German community in Paraguay. But Cosima's Diaries show that Wagner held F&ouml;rster in general and the South American project in particular in contempt. Why this &quot;mistake&quot;? Because it suits Gutman's thesis.Or take Wagner's late essays. If you read the essays themselves rather than Gutman's profoundly dishonest exegesis, you find a man wrestling with his own racism.In _Heroism and Christianity_, for example, Wagner does take it as a given that white people are superior to other &quot;races&quot;. Wagner, like many other European and American artists, was the product of a racist culture and it is unhistorical to pretend otherwise. But then Wagner writes that although people find the idea of the commingling of all human &quot;races&quot; into &quot;a uniform equality&quot; distressing, this is because of their cultural blinkers. &quot;It is only looking at it through the reek of our own civilisation and culture than makes this picture so repellant,&quot; he says.Christianity, Wagner continues, is superior to other religions because it is aimed equally at all &quot;races&quot; while Judaism and Brahminism, for example, include noble ideas but are aimed at only one &quot;race&quot; or caste. Although (he writes) it is &quot;natural&quot; [meaning &quot;likely to occur in nature&quot;] for strong &quot;races&quot; to rule weaker &quot;races&quot;, the rule of one &quot;race&quot; by another has led to &quot;exploitation&quot; and an &quot;utterly immoral system&quot;. Wagner's answer is equality of all &quot;races&quot; under &quot;a universal moral concord&quot;, something Wagner suggests that Christian doctrines could bring about. (Wagner was not a Christian, but in later life admired Christian rituals and doctrines.)The essay is not enlightened by modern standards, but in its historical context it stands as Wagner's rejection of the proto-Nazi ideas of his own day. Gutman's systematic distortions are regrettable not just because they go beyond mere inaccuracy but also because they are much less interesting than the truth.A passage recently cited as an example of Gutman's merits provides another example of Gutman's method:&quot;Monsalvat was Wagner's paranoiac concept of a small self-contained elite group, uniquely possessed of the truth, obsessed with its 'purity,' and struggling with an outside world it held worthless. Redemption was promised the hard-pressed knights, but, obviously, the Wagnerian redeemer was not to be found among Jewish craftsmen or lepers. Not by accident did Guernemanz almost immediately remark upon Parsifal's noble, highborn appearance. He knew what signs to read. Racial heredity and strict breeding, not natural selection, formed the new mechanism of salvation. Wagnerian eugenics had come into being; in his latest writing the composer had embraced the darker implications of Darwinism.&quot;Problems? First, Gutman misses the way _Parsifal_ shows Montsalvat critically and ironically (our first glimpse is of its watchmen sleeping on the job), as a damaged community that fails to live up to its ideals. An example is the knights' and squires' rejection of Kundry as Outsider, a moral fault for which the saintly G&uuml;rnemantz, clearly Wagner's mouthpiece, reproves them.Second, the reference to &quot;Jewish craftsmen and lepers&quot; is Gutman's invention. Neither are mentioned, let alone disparaged, in _Parsifal_.Third, Gutman must know that the remark on the hero's &quot;noble appearance&quot; is standard in Wagner's source material, and referred not so much to race as to &quot;gentle upbringing&quot;, meaning having &quot;courtly&quot; deportment as opposed to the gestures and manners of a peasant. Example? In Wagner main source, von Eschenbach's _Parzifal_, similar observations are made about Parzifal's half-brother Fierafiz, whose mother was black.Fourth, the Montsalvat community is not &quot;self-contained&quot;. Wagner's text mentions that Gawain is a member of the Montsalvat community, though that character is also a member of Arthur's court. And Gawain, like the other Montsalvat knights, spends as much or more time out in the world than at Montsalvat.Fifth, Montsalvat's alleged &quot;racial hereditary and strict breeding&quot; is more Gutmanian invention. Not only does _Parsifal_ not contain any such idea, or anything remotely like it, but Wagner's text rules out the possibility. G&uuml;rnemantz tells us that Montsalvat was founded by Titurel, who has had one adult child and is still alive when the opera begins. G&uuml;rnemantz was also a founding Montsalvat member. &quot;Breeding program&quot;? When? Instead the Montsalvat community must have grown through that bugbear even of modern racists: immigration. Some of Montsalvat's knights and squires may be children of original members, but that's hardly a breeding program. (By the way, Wagner's Montsalvat is in Spain. Not Germany.)Can a passage so densely inaccurate be the product of mere carelessness? I think not.Actually Gutman misses an intriguing possibility about Parsifal's ancestry. Parsifal comes from \"Arabia\". His father Gamuret was probably Welsh or Cornish, but we are told that Herzeleide was pregnant with Parsifal when Gamuret was in \"Arabia\". Since knights didn't take wives with them on crusade, the implication is that Gamuret met Herzeleide in \"Arabia\". (Wagner's text concerning Herzeleide differs significantly from his sources.) It's amusing in this context to consider that Wagner's Parsifal may have been what the media is currently calling \"of Mid-Eastern appearance\", and quite ineligible for the Hitler Youth. Still, the Nazi thing is Gutman's obsession, not Wagner's. Oh, and far from loving _Parsifal_, as Gutman would have you believe, the truth is that the Nazis banned it.In short, Gutman's &quot;first casualty&quot; wasn't Wagner, but truth. An irresponsibly unreliable book.Cheers!Laon",

                "review/text": "Gutman has an axe to grind. He despises Wagner and sets out to discredit the composer whenever possible. While it is true that Wagner had many despicable traits (antisemitism, mendacity, oportunism, megalomania, womanizing, etc.), Gutman creates a wholly unsympathetic picture of this musical genius. Gutman sees the influence of Wagner's antisemetism everywhere, similar to the way UFO enthusiasts see the influence of space aliens everywhere in our culture. As a result this biography is not fair and balanced. Gutman's goal seems to be to get the reader to despise Wagner as much as he does. Laon, in his review, gives many detailed examples of Gutman's intellectual slipperiness as a biographer. Gutman maintains that Parsifal is Wagner's antisemitic magnum opus and the fact that Wagner's text does not support his argument, Gutman regards as proof of how clever Wagner was in hiding his antisemitism in his artistic works. He hid it so well that only Gutman can see it. Give me a break! How could the fact that there is no evidence be proof of the agrument he is making?Regarding the \"ihn\" versus \"ihm\" controversy in Tristan, Laon does a good job in elucidating Gutman's silly inuendoes. There is another possibility, which is that Wagner was trying to emulate an archaic German, so he may have deliberately chosen the \"wrong\" grammar (by modern standards) to make the sentence sound like an older pre-modern Germanic tongue. Native German speakers sometimes have difficulty understanding Wagner's texts for that reason. I agree with Laon that Gutman's book is decent on the facts of Wagner's life but is biased and misleading on the interpretation of those facts. It's too bad that such a knowledgeable writer as Gutman could let his personal biases mar what could have been a balanced and thoughtful biography of this controversial musical genius. Gutman's logic appears to run as follows: Wagner was anti-Semitic, Hitler liked Wagner's music and ideas, therefore Wagner was responsible for the Holocaust.I read this book hoping to understand how Wagner, with all his character flaws, could write such beautiful and psychologically insightful musical dramas. Gutman did not answer my question, except to say that what appear on the surface to be works of genius are really clever attempts by a scoundrel to indoctrinate others into his antisemitism. How is it then that I come away from listening to Wagner with a loathing of anti-Semitism and a overwhelming experience of comapssion for the human family?",

In each case evolution has a \"direction,\" a tendency to produce more highly organized patterns. The \"spirit of evolution\" lies in its directionality: order out of chaos. After arriving at the emergence of mind, Wilber traces the evolution of human consciousness through its major stages of development, pointing out that at each stage there is the \"dialectic of progress\"-every increase in consciousness is bought at a price: new freedom also means new license to choose destruction. He particularly focuses on the rise of modernity and post-modernity-what they mean, how they relate to gender issues, to psychotherapy, to ecological concerns, and to various liberation movements. Most important, he asks: Can spiritual concerns be integrated with massive developments of the modern world?

                "review/text": "As another reviewer suggests, this is indeed an extremely ambitious work. Wilber's life's work is exceedingly ambitious, and this volume is the most comprehensive and the most demanding single volume he has yet publishedFirst, I will say to the KW book shopper, this is not the best of his works to start with, in my opinion. Even for the serious reader, I would recommend &quot;ramping up&quot; to this book by reading some of his other work first. You'll get more out of this one if you do. At least read &quot;A Brief History of Everything&quot; first, which KW wrote as a more accessible summary of the thought presented in SES. Because KW's work draws on thinkers from so many disparate fields, the terminology alone can be daunting in SES, unless you are already conversant in the languages of developmental psychology, linguistic analysis, sociology, metaphysics, epistemology, eastern religions and so on. Reading ABHE first will at least give you a good overview of the territory before plunging into SES. I had read eight other KW works before I took on this one, and I think my understanding of SES benefitted from that.That said, this is a stunning work, and if any one volume of KW's work can be said to lay out the core of his thinking, this would be it. The book begins by outlining what KW calls the &quot;Twenty Tenets,&quot; which are, as he calls them, &quot;orienting generalizations&quot; that place in context all that comes after. Here he explains his holarchical model, the &quot;spectrum of consciousness,&quot; the basic characteristics of the evolution of consciousness, and his Four Quadrants model of wisdom traditions, or approaches to understanding the universe, which may be his most unique contribution to philosophical thought. From there he proceeds to flesh out his integral theory of knowledge, which seeks to establish a way for us to reconcile (and integrate) the valuable contributions of approaches as disparate as neuroscience and mysticism, Freudian analysis and systems theory. And he shows how this affects our approaches to, yes, sex (gender identity, roles of the sexes, feminism, the mens' movements, et al), ecology (what do various worldviews, belief systems, and perpectives along the spectrum of consciousness mean for our approach to ecological issues, and what are their prospects?) and spirituality (what place does spirituality still have in the story of humankind, and how do we make sense of the seemingly limitless and contradictory number of approaches to this oldest and most important of questions?)The most unique contribution KW has made to world thought is to begin the integration of the many wisdom traditions and modes of inquiry--to set out a methodology for doing so and to begin to do it. Am I having a mystical experience, is God speaking to me, or is it just something my brain chemistry is doing? Or is it just a culturally-conditioned response? Or regression to a prerational state? Any one approach has its answer, but who is right? And what place does each kind of answer have have in an integrated approach to understanding? Wilber says each of the many modes of serious inquiry has part of the truth, but not all of it. He asks how we honor the valuable contributions from each such partial view to begin to develop a comprehensive view of the whole. SES is Wilber's most all-inclusive single attempt to address these questions. His work is essential to any serious thinker or seeker of the truth today. And for any remotely serious student of Ken Wilber's work, you must read this book.",

An exhilarating, liberating experience awaits those who seek to move beyond mere arid and intellectual categories and concepts and plunge into the &quot;living water&quot; of Jesus' revelation.Speaking of Jesus, the one potential stumbling block here for Course students may be the fact that the &quot;voice&quot; of Journey Beyond Words identifies himself as Jeshua and the implication, of course, is that this is the very same personality (i.e., Jesus) who dictated the original Course to Helen Schucman, beginning in 1965.Whether or not this is actually the case is left, of course, to the reader to decide for herself. But since, ! in fact, the whole purpose of both ACIM as well as JBW, is to get beyond all dualities and distinctions, particularly &quot;specialness&quot; ( a very key concept in both sets of material) of any kind, then I think it will only be the quibblers, the fundamentalists, and the Course In Miracles gurus and &quot;big names&quot; who may take issue with Jesus/Jeshua since JBW will probably threaten their own &quot;specialness&quot; as &quot;official&quot; interpreters of the Course to their often struggling, &quot;dualistic&quot; students.I submit that if and when the Journey Beyond Words is actually completed (i.e., experientially, of course, and not merely conceptually), then any and all questions as to who &quot;really wrote&quot; either or both of these two completely enlivening and enlightening books, will be dissolved in the pure Oneness of That which (alone!) is.One final note: I don't think the Journey Beyond Words should be approached before the reader is confident in his understanding of what the Course In Miracles is all about, i.e., Sonship with God. I may be off here, but I feel that to do otherwise might short-circuit the impact that the Journey Beyond Words can have on the sincere student of the Course and also may cause the reader to miss out on the richness of the original work (ACIM), as contrasted with the razor-sharp penetration of the Journey's &quot;beyond&quot; words.Yes, 5 stars indeed!",

On the cover it is clearly labled as &quot;A Companion to The Workbook of The Course&quot; and is also designated as &quot;A Miracles Studies Book&quot;. As a result I feel that this book has not yet reached a wide enough audience. This book and one that came after &quot;The Other Voice&quot; are more than just adjuncts to the Course.The speaker of these teachings, Jeshua (Jesus), uses the word &quot;extension&quot; to denote the difference between the true Creation of God and the world that we experience, which he says comes from projection, an activity of the ego, and therefore not true creation. Extension is God's expression of His Love. The word informs us of the profoundly important fact that True Creation can in no way be anything that is outside of God. All creation must be simply God extending Him/Herself. That means that if all True Creation is simply God, and God is omnipotent and omnipresent, then all True Creation must be the extension of That. And God's Will, by definition, must be perfect, so there can be NO will in Creation that is separate or opposed to That Will. Think about the implications of that. Then get this book.My life and intention has been irreversibly changed by this material. It is more than just a clarification of previous material. I believe that it can be thought of as an &quot;extension&quot; of the Course, in the larger meaning of that word. It is the profound Love of the Course extended in Love. The words are very clear and straightforward and easy to understand from the point of view of language, but these lessons live up to the title, &quot;Journey Beyond Words&quot;. It may be 1,000 years or more before we can really begin to understand everything that is trying to come through here, but I strongly suggest that if you live with these words, rather than just read them, your journey to perfect joy and peace, where death is merely a transition, will be much more direct. There are many paths to that, but I feel that this is perhaps the most profound. The importance of this book and all of the words of Jeshua cannot, in my estimation, be overstated.",

The content has been diluted and its message easy to ignore. Just what your ego wants. Course students are attracted to these kind of books because the Couse is not easy. It takes attention and dedication. Cliff Notes on the Course. The Course Lite. Whatever you want to call it, it is not the Course. Will it help you? It might. Want to read it? Go ahead. Just keep in mind that doing so is keeping you away from the Course. If you need help with ACIM then go to the works of Kenneth Wapnick, who was a close associate and friend of the two people responsible for the Course. His works are invaluable for the student of the Course.",

The message itself is one of hope and promise -- that we are all one and that the universe, including ourselves, is a single undivided whole that we can experience with the help of God.

In my experience it addresses the underlying theme of ACIM in ways that differ from ACIM (which may mean they will touch you in new ways) whilst doing the topics at hand just as much service and perhaps more as ACIM did.If you tried to read ACIM and essentially liked it (i.e. you didn't put it down in total disfavour) but found it inaccessible or hard to get through then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book. I am quite certain it will bring a deeper experience of joy, understanding and love into your world.Now, I trust that many reading these reviews will NOT have read ACIM. Is that you?If it is, I would say that the value of this book will depend very much on what you are looking for (which is the case with most books, right?). So, if you are looking for a book that will provide you with: a gentle, clear, and easy to read reminder of what's True; a wake up call; a loving yet potentially transformative journey into releasing that which is holding you back within your view of the world/life/creation; something you can pick up at any time and read a few pages of to bring yourself back to a place of centred peace and Truth; a spiritual cosmology that is free of much of the \"fluff\" present in many \"New Age\" teachings, and free of the dogma of most religious paths... (the list goes on) then again, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.If, however, your world view is firmly rooted into a particular organised spiritual dogma / concept that relies heavily on spiritual rules, regulations, doctrines, hierarchies, etc., then this book may simply annoy you, rub you up the wrong way, and leave you feeling dissatisfied. In which case I do not recommend it. I do not think this book would suit most people into the traditional church based approach to Christianity and Christ Consciousness. Of course, being annoyed and frustrated by this book may not be such a bad thing... I suspect it would require a relatively closed mind to react in such a way, so perhaps this book will be just the thing to jolt the mind open, allow new possibilities to emerge.Whatever the case may be... may Love extend into your world in this moment... and if you buy this book may you enjoy the ride.If you read this book and enjoy it, you will certainly want to read and enjoy the other book by Brent Haskell,The Other Voice: A Companion to the Text of \"the Course\" Chapters 1-15 (Miracles Studies Book). As far as I know, however, Haskell has not yet written the follow-up to that book which would cover the remaining subjects of ACIM. If you already feel you're going to enjoy Journey Beyond Words I recommend buying both these books together. You'll be happy you can dip into both together and/or one right after the other.I wish you all the best,Jonathan EvattInternational teacher, lecturer, and author of multi-award winning bookPeace, Power, and Presence: A guide to Self Empowerment, Inner Peace, and Spiritual Enlightenment, the first title in the Wisdom for a Life of Freedom series.",

        "description": "Madame Blavatsky's Victorian-era masterpiece is now scaled down to its essentials, providing the most readable, accessible experience ever of one of history's seminal occult works. The Secret Doctrine, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky's masterwork on the origin and evolution of the universe and humanity itself, is arguably the most famous, and perhaps the most influential, occult book ever written. Published since 1888 only in expensive, two-volume editions of some 1,400 pages, it has long eluded the grasp of modern readers- until now. This single-volume edition, abridged and annotated by historian and Theosophical scholar Michael Gomes, places the ideas of The Secret Doctrine within reach of all who are curious. In particular, Gomes provides a critical sounding of the book's famous stanzas on the genesis of life and the cosmos- mysterious passages that Blavatsky said originated from a primeval source and which form the heart of The Secret Doctrine. Gomes scrupulously scales down the book's key writings on symbolism to their essentials, and offers notes and a glossary to illuminate arcane references. His historical and literary introduction casts new light on some of the book's sources and on the career of its brilliant and elusive author, one of the most intriguing personages of the nineteenth century. At once compact and representative of the work as a whole, this new edition of The Secret Doctrine brings unprecedented accessibility to the key esoteric classic of the modern era.",

                "review/text": "This book was a startling and controversial spiritual landmark in 1888 when it first appeared. It covers cosmic, planetary, and human evolution, as well as science, religion, and mythology. It is based on the esoteric Stanzas of Dzyan, with reference data from over 1,200 sources. It was virtually the Bible for the early Theosophical Society, and has continued to be so even today in the 21st century. The work comprises three volumes: Cosmogenesis, Anthropogenesis and a further volume with index and bibliography adding immense value as a study tool. Cosmogenesis is the origin of the universe, while Anthropogenesis is the origin of humanity. In many countries around the world there are study groups dedicated to understanding this book. It is a compendium of nearly all religious and esoteric knowledge available at the time, but gathered psychically by the author. If you know about the life of the author (Blavatsky) the psychic guidance method seems the most plausible means of her obtaining the remarkable content for the Secret Doctrine.The impact of this book is so great that it should be an essential for anyone into the spiritual growth areas of today. Aside from theosophy, the work in this book is the starting point for all New Age philosophies. It grew out of a social climate of spiritualist seances and psychic phenomena, generalising all that was known then and integrating it in spectacular fashion. Many of the intelligencia of the day were influenced by this work, and wrote books on many aspects of this. It also led a prolonged Western excursion into the Eastern mysteries and religions.The book adds depth and insights to so many religions and philosophies, and yet follows the edict, \"there is no religion higher than truth\". For example, it adds to Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Cabbala, Rosicrucianism, etc you name it! It also has a lot to say about the science of the late 19th century. Examples of modern New Age philosophies dependent either directly or indirectly on the Secret Doctrine are:- the Alice A Bailey schools including the University of the Seven Rays, Summit Lighthouse, the I AM movement, Steiner's Anthroposophy, Wicca, many yoga schools, healing energy techniques like Reiki, Shiatsu, etc. There is still much ambivalence even today about the Secret Doctrine and its writings and its esoteric traditions associated with the Himalayan Masters of Wisdom. The best way to resolve these issues is to read the book for yourself. It is a difficult book, even impossible for some students who may be surprised at how strange its language seems at times to those new to such things. But it was written not as a \"suck it and see\" book, but as a \"live with me forever\" book. I'm very pleased to recommend it to you.",

                "review/text": "Although I do not question the importance of HP Blavatsky's magnum opus, &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;, in illuminating the basic tenets of theosophy, I do wish the readers of this book to keep in mind that one cannot and should not take everyhing HPB declares as incontrovertible truth.One problematic idea in this book is the issue of &quot;root races&quot;.I do believe that HPB largely meant to define &quot;root races&quot; in sociological rather than biological terms. As Katinka Hesselink states in her article, &quot;Race, Sub-race and Sociological interpretation&quot; : &quot;H.P. Blavatsky uses the word race in a variety of connotations. Sometimes it means the present day humanity, sometimes a 'sub-race' of mankind. When she means present day humanity she does not say humanity, because she was of the opinion that humanity goes through a variety of stages (called rounds), which take tremendous amounts of time...The people of America and Western Europe are clearly the wealthiest and the most intellectually active at this time in history. Blavatsky therefore distinguishes them from other people by calling 'us' a sub-race of the fifth rootrace. This seems to me more a sociological distinction than a physical one..&quot;The problem with the &quot;root race&quot; theory begins when HPB seems to imply that &quot;root race&quot; also has a biological component as well as a sociological one. This seems to have led HPB to declare that certain &quot;races&quot; (and here she seems to mean biological) of people are inferior to others and, therefore, opens a pandora's box of bigotry and discrimination as well as many twisted interpretations of her theory. Hitler is a terrifying example of how this theory has been misused. It well known that he kept a copy of &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; by his bedside and relied on it to develop his dangerously inaccurate version of HPB's theory.One of the basic tenets of theosophy, however, is to &quot;to form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or colour.&quot; The truth of this tenet is that EVERY human being has a soul that is progressing towards enlightenment via many lifetimes of learning. There can not, therefore, be anyone &quot;superior&quot; or &quot;inferior&quot; to anyone else. There are only people at different stages of the same path to wisdom. The idea of &quot;inferior biological races&quot; should be vehemently opposed by a truly &quot;enlightened&quot; person.Another problematic issue is the origin of the ideas contained in &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;. The brilliant and world renowned Kabbalah scholar, Gershom Scholem in &quot;Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism&quot; states: &quot;There can be little doubt in my opinion that the famous stanzas of the mysterious &quot;Book Dyzan' on which ..The Secret Doctrine is based owe something, both in title and content, to the pompous pages of the Zoharic writing called 'Sifra Di-Tseniutha'...The solemn and magniloquent style of these pages may well have impressed her suceptible mind...The 'Book Dzyan' is..nothing but an occultist hypostasy of the Zohairic title...&quot;I write these paragraphs not to discourage you from reading &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; but to encouarge you to read it with a discriminating mind and eye. HPB and many of the later theosophists mix many truths with even more inaccuracies. (In the case of Alice Bailey, these inaccuracies include her vile anti-semitism and biological racism.) Keep in mind the basic tenet that I quoted above: &quot;A Universal Brotherhood of Humanity&quot;.",

                "review/text": "This is one of the few books that humble me when I contemplate it. Rather, Madam Blavatsky's knowlege and intellect humbles me. Take just about any \"newly rediscovered\" esoteric topic of any worth and you will most probably find it explained in considerable detail in either this work or _Isis Unveiled_. I am dismayed that so few people, or biliographies, give credit to Madam Blavatsky, or to the Theosophical Society that she founded. I guess we are just too \"quaint\" and \"old-fashion\" for the \"New Age.\"There is just too much encyclopedic knowlege here to simply read through from scratch. You need to work up to it. Try a introductory text like _Ocean of Theosophy_ by William Q. Judge. However, do not be afraid to pick up either volume and simply \"browse.\" I still do this after all these years- and I am still surprised and amazed at what I find.One further thing, there has been a considerable amount of character assassination against Madam Blavatsky in the last few years. The authors that have penned these attacks have no understanding of the matters that they address. First of all, no one was a stronger critic of seances than Madam Blavatsky. Secondly, the Society has always held that one should never charge money for spiritual matters. As for the ad hominem attacks that she was grossly obese, well, this is the lowest form of slander and doesn't deserve comment. Simply take a look at any of the surviving photographs to see the truth.Concerning attacks on Theosophical concepts such as the \"seven races\" and \"seven globes\", just keep in mind that the perenial philosophy holds that the highest part of what makes up a person pre-exists on a higher plane- and will return there after we cross over. Just remember the old gnostic concept of \"seven heavens.\" Literalism is a mistake in theosophy, just as it has proven in fundamentalist Christianity.",

                "review/text": "Aside from being Sirhan Sirhan's inspiration for killing the younger Kennedy, this is a rather remarcable book. It was the first book that Mr. Sirhan requested when he was usured off to jail. This was because of Mrs. Blavatsky's teaching in the book that he was 'Becoming a God' and nothing could prevent him from achiving 'His Will'. Of course, this is not a new teaching. It is just tragic that he took her at her literal word.The New Age movment is a direct deseandant of Mrs. Blavatsky's writings. First with her 'Isis Unveiled' (pub. 1877), a &quot;1,300-page compilation of mysticism, tall stories and archaeology, which hints at a lost knowledge that had been familiar to the initiates of antiquity&quot;...&quot;The result was both vitriolic and garbled, but 'Isis Unveiled' was to provide endless scope for interpretation.&quot; (Encyclopedia of the Unexplained - Ed. Richard Cavendish, Consultant: Professor J.B. Rhine [of Parapsychology fame], writen by historian James Webb - pg 250).The book was 'shown' to her in the air before her eyes as the Akashic Records. The Akashic Records are 'distinct vibrations' for every creature in the Chosmos that can be read by anyone whos eyes are 'atuned' to the mystical. A kind of 'cosmic record-keeper' to be used in determaning whether or not you come back as a bug or what-not in your next life. They were made famous by Levi Dowling (1844-1911), an old Cival War army chaplain, who wrote 'The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ'. It was published after his death by Eva S. Dowling, Ph.D. - the Scribe to the Messenger - in 1911. The 'Christ' (lit. anointed) was mearly a title, like President or Prime Minister, and is used by many peaple (Buddha, Krishna, Mohamed the Prophet, and so-on) - not just one single person.In writing 'The Secret Doctrine' Mrs. Blavatsky used the same method to interpet the ancient 'Stanzas of Dzyan' [not the so-called Chinese text interpreted in H.P. Lovecraft's works]. Published in 1888 it was mearly an extention of 'Isis Unveiled' an! d a serious attempt at reconciling the differences between East and West occultic thought. 'Man is God in the making' was her basic premiss. It is slightly easyer to make sence of than 'Isis Unveiled' and is the literal bible for the Theosophical Society. After Mrs. Blavatsky's death in 1891 the Theosophical Society (started by Blavatsky in 1875) splintered into four seperate groups - helped by Annie Besant's telling the world that the New Messiah was comming in 1906. Jiddu Krishnamurti was hailed as this New Messiah, a hindu boy manipulated by Besant. On 28 Dec 1925 he was hailed as the New Messiah come to heal the world. But in 1929 Krishnamurti renounced all claims to being a Messiah, and subsiquently suffered amnesia to any events that happened before then. Because of this farce Dr. Steiner (1861-1925) had broken away and started the Anthroposophical Society - Alice Bailey did the same and started the Acaine School - and Guy and Edna Ballard broke away to start the now infamous 'I Am' school in the 1930's. It was Mrs. Ballard that had made the prophecy in the late 1980's that the soviet's were about to launch a nuclear attack and all her disciples hade to barracade themselves in a fallout shelter in the Teton Mt's. Needless to say, she is hard to get in touch with now.Athough 'The Secret Doctrine' is a product of Mrs. Blavatsky's mysticism, it is still a book that has a far reach even today. This alone makes it an invalueable addition to any library. The Age of Aquarius (beleived by Mrs. Blavatsky to be upon us) is now here. What we make of it is another story entirly.Sincerly, Shawn W.

But then, there come the flaws...The central issue in the book is that just any kind of innovation, puzzle of fit, knowledge growth, or whatever you call it, can only be achieved through a process very much like biological evolution as accepted by the neo-darwinian paradigm: cumulative blind variation followed by the survival of the fittest. Cziko also shows how explanations for these puzzles of fit have evolved in all fields from providential explanations (like in the book of Genesis, where things happened to achieve a pourpose previously devised), through instructionist ones (like Lamarck's &quot;Use and Disuse&quot; plus &quot;Inheritance of Acquired Characters&quot;, where the environment would &quot;force&quot; the individual creatures to change just in the right, successful way, and then the creatures would pass these changes on to their offsprings), and finally to selectionist ones (Darwin's Selection Theory). He says that only selectionist explanations can give truly &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;naturalistic&quot; accounts for these fits, without recoursing to miraculous schemes. In short: Cziko brings us the good news that not only are we merely machines (like we have feared ever since the mechanical physics of Newton), but we are blind ones too!The starting point of his reasoning is evolutionary biology, and Cziko's understanding of it seems to me too narrow-minded, with a strong bias toward the old notions of New-Darwinism. Consequently, his report and deductions on it are misinformative. Evolution was (and, to a large extent, still is) thought to be based on &quot;variation and survival of the fittest&quot;. But in the past the view of the causes of these variations were believed to be basically errors: DNA damage by the environment, and failure of the organism to correct damages or to make precise copies of the DNA. It's been a long time now that this view has changed dramatically, and organisms, even as simple as bacteria, are now known (from before 1990) to possess amazing control over the ways and the contexts in which these variations happen. They can trigger DNA mutation under appropriate conditions (stress, threats to survival), and even control which areas of the genome will be subject to change. This renders organisms much more &quot;smartly&quot; interactive with the environment as might be expected from reading Cziko.So, what Cziko did not tell about the process of antibody creation by B-Lynphocytes is that when they undergo somatic hypermutation to fine tune their antibody production to the antigen, this hypermutation is, first, triggered by the interaction with the very antigen, and second, it is far from blind: the mutation happens only in a very restricted area of the chromosome, changing only the areas of the antibody molecule that interact with the antigen (and not even the whole molecule!). So this is a very &quot;thematic&quot; kind of mutation-variation; maybe &quot;short-sighted&quot;, but surely not &quot;blind&quot;!When he comments on the phenomenon of &quot;directed mutation&quot;, the strange capability of many procarionts (like bacteria) to seemingly direct their mutation to the desired result, he takes a rather cynical and slightly arrogant stand, apparently rejecting the existance of the phenomenon itself, even saying &quot;But let us continue to imagine for a moment that a bacterium was able to change just those genes regulating metabolism in just the right way to allow for the digestion of a foreign sugar&quot;. It seems that he read only two research articles on this, and not quite well, and draw much of his attitude towards the phenomenon from his academic-environment prejudiced and uninformed criticism. By the time he was writing his book , directed mutation had been fully demonstrated by many researchers, and not only by Cairns. Actually, even as early as 1984, four years before Cairns revolutionary and controversial paper on it, J.A. Shapiro had already shown the phenomenon fully (Observations on the Formation of Clones Containing araB-lacZ cistrons fusions. Molecular &amp; General Genetics 1984;194(1-2):79-80), only in a much more discreet maner. By 1995, a wealth of information was already available, from researchers like Shapiro and B.G. Hall, among others, and now even eukariotes (yeast) are known to perform &quot;directed mutation&quot; (Hall BG. Adaptive Mutagenesis: a Process that Generates Almost Exclusively Beneficial Mutations. Genetica 1998;102(103):109-125.). Strikingly, this process shows some resemblance to human B-lynphocyte somatic hypermutation!When Cziko moves on to the other areas, scientific knowledge growth, etc, the already &quot;short-sighted&quot; (and not blind) variation seems to have undergone a surgical operation on its eye and starts to see almost sharply. Also, the second step, that is, the survival of the fittest (in biology, through killing the non-fit) seems to change to a true &quot;selection&quot; process (choosing one among many, by identifying its desirable qualities, which is quite different from &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;). Even Campbell and Pinker, which he defines as fully (or almost) selectionists, seem to turn to rather providential viewpoints, like &quot;innativism&quot; and &quot;constraints&quot;, for triggering and orienting the variation, and guiding the selection, not succeding in solving Meno's providential dilema: &quot;...if you don't already possess the knowledge you are looking for, how will you know when you have found it?&quot;Cziko, like many, wrongly equals &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;naturalistic&quot; explanations to &quot;mechanical&quot; ones, and since our mechanistic view of nature is basically deterministic, he only sees lamarckism as an instructionist process, not a &quot;freely-willed&quot; one, failing to address vital phenomena like human consciouness and apparent free-will.",

Cziko brilliantly reviews the application of selection theory (blind variation followed by selection of best fits) to fields as different as neurology, immunology, linguistics, education, pharmacology and artificial intelligence, and presents a strong argument for the claim that innovation in any field can only arise through an application of selection theory. How does our immune system deal with a potentially infinite variety of antigens? Not directly through information contained in the genes, which are quite limited in number. Not through direct copying of the shapes of antigens, since no mechanism allows it to copy an infinite number of potential shapes. Rather, sequential generations of B lymphocytes produce antibodies that fit the antigen better and better, with continual selection of the B lymphocytes that produce the best-fitting antibodies. How do we acquire new knowledge? It is not innate, as Plato claimed. And we don't directly &quot;learn&quot; it from others, except in the sense that a parrot learns. Rather, we are constantly trying to make better and better sense of our perceptions, by building better and better explanations in our minds and rejecting inadequate explanations. Information and instruction received from others are only perceptions to us until we have incorporated them into our own explanatory schemes. So &quot;learning&quot; is actually an active process of explanation-building through trial and error, in other words, a form of blind variation of explanatory schemes and selection of the best ones.This book is well-written, clear, and immensely &quot;instructive&quot;, causing me to modify a number of explanatory schemes in my own mind. I put it alongside the best of Dawkins, Dennett and Wilson. It should have a much wider readership than it apparently has.",

Psychological and historical research in the past few years has produced evidence to the contrary: for most people \"false generics\" seldom if ever convey a female image, nor are they ancient unchangeable rules of the English grammar that have always been used by the educated. Using hundreds of examples, mostly from published sources, the authors illustrate what certain words are saying to us on a subliminal level. Solutions are supplied that range from word substitutions to suggestions for rewriting. Without a trace of self-conscious righteousness, and with refreshing humor, Miller and Swift provide surprising insights into the English language and the ways in which people use it and are used by it. They demonstrate that to be in command of the language, we must find clear, convincing, and graceful ways to convey our ideas accurately. We must recognize and replace exclusive, distorting, ambiguous, and injurious words.",

                "review/text": "The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle described Ercongota, daughter of a seventh-century English king, as &quot;a wonderful man.&quot; No, she didn't have a sex change. In her day, &quot;man&quot; was a true generic term meaning &quot;person&quot; or &quot;human being.&quot; Many older English writings do indeed use &quot;man&quot; in this sense. But, as this book explains, our language has changed, and this generic usage is no longer appropriate. Problem is, many writers who grew up on the classics have internalized the outdated language of our literary ancestors. One of the reasons I bought this book was to learn how to update my writing style.The first chapter, &quot;Man as a False Generic,&quot; traces the history of gender usages in the English language. This chapter did a great deal to help me personally overcome my initial negative reactions to &quot;feminist&quot; language by explaining how English has grown and evolved over the centuries. For example, &quot;you&quot; was once a plural only (the singular being &quot;thou&quot;), and the use of &quot;they&quot; was once a legitimate generic singular pronoun. Such classical writers as William Thackeray, George Eliot, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and even William Shakespeare used it regularly. Only later, in the 18th century, did it go out of fashion. Now it's back in style again, as a gender-free alternative to &quot;he.&quot; (Example: &quot;Each person can decide what they want.&quot;)What I like best about the Handbook is the way it uses actual examples (both good and bad) from published works to illustrate its points. Especially interesting were the references from old grammar books, some of which were so absurdly outdated that I literally laughed out loud. The authors then show how the various examples can be re-written with gender-free language without loss of clarity or style.To me as a writer, this down-to-earth approach was more convincing than the angry diatribes about &quot;Patriarchy&quot; which had previously turned me off to the whole gender issue. If there's a problem with my writing, don't call me names, just show me how to fix it! This book does that very well, explaining clearly and with good humor. I also appreciate the thesaurus in the back of the book, which serves as a quick reference for the most common gender-problem words.The one weakness of this book is that it skimps on religious language issues, which get only half a page. The authors do correctly point out that the original text of the Bible uses feminine pronouns and imagery that got lost in translation, but there are no specific examples cited. Nor does the Handbook give any of the genderless alternatives to &quot;The Lord&quot; (such as Ruler, Sovereign, Creator, Holy One, Blessed One, Heavenly Parent, etc.) now in use among Jews, Christians, and others. Instead, the authors simply refer the reader to a bibliography in the back of the book. But unless you happen to be a theologian, you are not likely to have those references handy when you need a quick synonym for &quot;The Lord.&quot; Nor is &quot;The Lord&quot; included in the list of problem words in the Handbook's thesaurus, although &quot;Goddess&quot; does rate an entry as a no-no (as are all &quot;-ess&quot; words, according to this book). It would have been more helpful to give a few examples from those bibliography resources.",

To my relief, even though I do not agree with all its conclusions, I've found the book definitely worthwhile.It is short but well-written and thorough, tackling major issues in nonsexist writing with humor and clarity. Its detailed, structured table of contents is especially helpful as it enables the reader to get quickly to a desired topic, whether it be the use of &quot;man&quot; as a suffix, &quot;'they&quot; as a singular, gratuitous modifiers, assigning gender to gender-neutral terms, or whatnot. Its examples of (allegedly) sexist and nonsexist writing are useful, and frequently are pulled from actual published works. Shakespeare, for example, is quoted as having written &quot;God send everyone their heart's desire,&quot; which is used as evidence that &quot;their&quot; as a singular pronoun has not always been taboo in English; it is only since the eighteenth or nineteenth century, the authors argue, that grammarians began eschewing &quot;their&quot; in favor of &quot;his.&quot; Helpful reference notes to books and scholarly articles are included for readers who want to check up on such claims. (This I certainly intend to do in a few cases, in particular with regard to the authors' interesting assertion that Thomas Jefferson meant only males when he wrote in his Declaration that &quot;all men are created equal.&quot;)I must mention that the authors occasionally lapse into what I can only term idiocy. For example, they apparently believe that the use of &quot;man&quot; as a verb (e.g., &quot;The emergency room must be manned at all times&quot;) is sexist, despite the fact that, whatever its origin (which is irrelevant to its present-day meaning), the word has no sexist connotations for us today. Indeed, based on the authors' treatment of the verb &quot;to man,&quot; I see no reason not to throw out all words with &quot;man&quot; in them (such as by changing &quot;woman&quot; to &quot;womyn&quot;)--but the authors elsewhere reject such an approach, and rightfully so. So why this concern for a word's etymology if it has no practical effect in the present?The authors also seem to realize that a single word, such as &quot;man,&quot; can refer validly to two distinct concepts, such as generic or gender-specific &quot;man,&quot; which is good. But at times they inexplicably assert ambiguity when none is, in fact, present. I grant that in some cases such ambiguity is extremely hard, if not impossible, to avoid, and I am grateful for having been made aware of such instances; but the authors' occasional misidentifications do not give me confidence in their being free from bias themselves.This book's shortcomings notwithstanding, however, I must give it my recommendation. It contains many examples of sexist pitfalls in writing that I have not until now been aware of. I know I will use this book in the future when I have need of extra care to avoid offending an audience's sensibilities.",

They help us become aware of the many ways God speaks to us and provide us with ways to respond to God. This book explores and explains how the historical disciplines and perspectives of the Christian faith can deepen both our walk with God and our community with others. Reading the Bible is something that most of us are familiar with. Some even do it regularly. But do we really think about how we read and respond to Scripture? How deeply do we allow ourselves to be impacted by it? Contemplative Bible reading (or lectio divina, as it is often called) is an ancient method of approaching Scripture. Consisting of four parts, this method begins with the selected biblical passage and moves to meditating, praying, and contemplating what God is revealing through the Bible. Many of us tend to think of meditation as something done individually, but reflecting on Scripture in a small group invites us to act and encourages us to share with others how God is calling us to respond. Contemplative Bible Reading examines this spiritual discipline and invites your small group to approach Scripture in a new and challenging way. By exploring different passages and learning to hear God's voice in them, this guide will help you meditate and act on the truth of the Bible.",

This hesitancy is reflected in two ways: first, his insistence that the subjective experience of lectio divina be subjected to the discernment of the group and second, that a more Protestant &quot;objective&quot; study of the text precede the lectio divina. It is worth noting that for mediatio he suggests the imaginative approach most frequently associated with the Ignatian exercises. The result is a small group &quot;lectio divina&quot; which may work well as an introduction to lectio divina for Evangelical small study groups, but is questionable as a general introduction.My concerns begin with the directedness of the &quot;objective&quot; study - directed at times by multiple choice questions and at other times by mingling of personal application with the &quot;objective&quot; study. My concerns continue with assumptions as to what the person praying the Scripture will hear. After listening to the Scripture and noting what word/phrase catches one's attention the questions are: &quot;How is my life touched by this word?&quot; &quot;Am I being invited to respond?&quot; ending with prayer for the individual to your right in response to the invitation they noted.The result is that the focus becomes too oriented toward the human rather than the divine. And, it appears to me as a Catholic, that the author fails to trust in God's Scripture as a living communication between the lover (God) and the beloved (human) in the here and now.Nonetheless, the volume is useful as a way to introduce people used only to the intellectual study of Scripture to Scripture as direct prayer/communication. From the suggestions for further reading, I believe that the author &quot;did his homework&quot; and deliberately chose the audience and focus for the program. That is not an audience with which I am familar. But for individuals already comfortable with imaginative approaches to Scripture and contemplation, this is not an appropriate introductory volume.",

The exercises are meant for individuals to work towards the small group study.Contemplating Bible reading is a 1500+ year old tradition based on lectio divina, divine reading. The process, as described by peace is to Reading/Listening to Scripture (listening for phrases or words that jump out at the reader), Meditating (considering what these words/phrases are and the connection to one's life), Praying (...through these phrases), and Contemplation (resting and listening to God in these topics in silence).The book goes through a number of texts, and allows both groups and individuals to reflect upon them. It gives some background to the Scriptures, and allows for discussion questions. There are some thoughtful questions in each of the sessions, to allow the reader to think about the passages and the meaning (and application) more. There are also essays on Lectio divina and upon each step.It pretty good book for some small groups and individuals, if your small group is fairly biblically sound and mature as Christians. The danger of being overly subjective is present, and reading one's own story or one's own prejudices into the text (eisegesis) is a possibility.

In other words, rather than taking the Bible and looking at (a.k.a. criticizing) Pop Culture through what we think the Bible says, they take a thorough look at pop culture and use than as a method of viewing - or at least presenting - the God of the Bible. For any who have a hard time with that, read on.As one reviewer has already stated, from the outset this book states that it's primarily for people that already like Pop Culture and have wondered how to reconcile that with their Christian worldview. Furthermore, the authors ask tough questions of the Church. If the majority of the world connects with Pop Culture way better than they do with the Church, then why is that and what are we to do about it? Sorry, but the &quot;they're fallen beings&quot; excuse isn't gonna cut it anymore. Detweiler and Taylor take us beyond the &quot;seeker-sensitive&quot; approach and genuinely challenge the Church to engage Pop Culture in a respectful, dynamic way. Even in the profane, God is talking and it's time we recognized holy ground when we saw it. It's a different and (I think) more accurate version of things than we typically hear from the evangelical pulpit. God is talking through culture with or without the Church's approval!For those who have &quot;reservations&quot; about whether Christians should be as comfortable with culture as the book suggests, I offer this thought. The Bible was not written in a cultural vacuum, nor was Jesus born into one. Inspired? Sure. Absolutely devoid of any cultural influence? I think not. Read John 1 to those who haven't grown up in the church (or even those who have) and most would have a blank expression on their face because it was written to appeal to those influenced by the contemporary hot worldview: Stoicism. Parables were the movies of the day. There are four different Gospels in order to present Jesus slightly diffently to four different cultures. Paul understood culture enough to address it in Athens at the tribute to the &quot;unknown god&quot; (note that he didn't try to disprove their other gods before making the connection for them). These guys presented God (and, I would argue, understood God) through the lens of their culture. Why are we so affronted by others suggesting we do the same?&quot;There's nothing new under the sun&quot;, and God is still looking for those who will help meet Pop Culture where it's at and make those connections. This book does it in a whole different sort of way. Rather than giving easy examples (&quot;this movie means this&quot;) that you can use in your next Bible study, they attempt to form a worldview that takes in all of culture and finds where God is working (&quot;teach a man to fish&quot;, etc). Bottom line: most of us still need to have our &quot;scipt flipped&quot;. For me, this book, and the thought behind it, was the best place to do that.",

I'm used to and sick of Christian's rejection of pop culture and read each chapter with huge sighs of relief. The encyclopedic overview, the scores of references and quotes from books, magazines, websites, and the great minds of the past are an embarrassment of riches. I am also impressed with the balance and fair-mindedness given to the full spectrum of faith expressions, from the conservative to the radical. And also that the authors take on areas that are rarely dealt with in these kinds of books, like fashion or sports or celebs.Coincidentally, I just read Kreitzer's books, referenced in the intro, on reversing the hermeneutical flow with film, fiction and the two testaments, and I'm also a big fan of Johnston and his work on Reel Spirituality. I also have been reading up on Bresson and was led by it to Tarkovsky's brilliant work, Sculpting in Time. Glad to see that work and director getting his due in this book.And I would never have thought the chapter on sports would touch me the way it did. I had a dismally bad experience with sports as a kid -- and then moved to Dallas of all places, where I felt like I was in a sports prison and every other sermon had a team sports analogy to God. I'm glad to see that extreme sports are on the rise (I'm going to copy the Dilbert cartoon for a teenager in our apartment complex who has been restricted by our new Draconian managers from skateboarding in the driveway) and I'm glad to see that team sports are on the demise. Nothing against team sports, but I side with the millions of disgusted fans and, with that bad experience in my past, take a \"sick\" pleasure in seeing them tank.One personal negative: although this is a book, the authors do not consider books as an area of investigation, although thanks to Oprah and Amazon, reading is back. And although they bring the 'net in on the chapter about TV, I think it got short shrift in comparison to its importance to the children of the (technological) revolution. But perhaps they will put up a website that deals with the internet more fully. They will surely find their best audience online.",

                "review/text": "Detweiler and Taylor has written a resourceful book. It is informative on the development and social effects of popular culture. While sensitive to some contemporary critique of the role of media in late capitalism, these authors focus more on exploring the content of poplar culture and the spirituality it conveys. In doing so, the authors recognize the effects of consumerism, individualism, etc., and reflects on the need, for instance, of communal integration and a healthy theology of sexuality.This book is helpful in bringing different strands of popular into a historical context. Such things as reviewing the invention of the sewing machine to the beginning of department stores, for instance, or the formation of punk culture, I found informative and interesting.The overall approach is sympathetic to contemporary evangelical Christianity, valuing culture from a missional and dialogical standpoint, and its use of social-critical resources (especially from a Marxist tradition) is very limited. The authors affirm the importance of engaging popular culture as a conscious effort to understand and appreciate it. They affirm the notion of common grace, affirming that God present in popular and that Christians can learn through it. In engaging popluar culture, the authors attempt to make space for alternative visions of how to rethink and re-organize alternative theologies and ideas.",

Never the less, she made some very interesting points that should be looked at and ruminated over. She has a great gift at writing so that everyone can understand her meaning, which is something I have found more difficult with some of the other writers on religion.She was considered a prophet and had written this book almost a century ago and it is amazing how closely and accurately the events that she has prophesised about have fallen into place. It is almost like reading today's paper or watching current events on TV.As I have just finished reading the Bible, I found that her book went right along with it. A couple of things that I found of interest is her claim of the heresy of the church changing the day of the Sabbath to Sunday, which actually I have always wondered about myself, and of churches using Idols-like Mary, etc. both of which when I read the bible, I found was a big no-no. Jesus said that none of his Father's laws were to be changed and then there was mentioned in other places in the Bible that &quot;the times and laws they will be a changing&quot; (or something like that). So it did make me wonder, are we celebrating the wrong day for the Sabbath?Also, it was interesting to note that years ago, the scriptures themselves, were kept from the public and only the priests had access to them. It did indeed sound like, through Satan's influence (the best way that he messes with people's beliefs is when he can do it through a false religious front) that good, God-fearing Christians could have been led astray and not even have realized it. This is where everyone should read the Bible for themselves, and that way, they know exactly what it says and what to look our for.She is very good at describing the ways and means that Satan implements is evil ways. From inside the church, to friends, bribery, etc. nothing is missed by Satan when he looks for ways to mislead the people.If you want a good look at the end of times and the way it could very possibly end, this is an excellent book to read. She is very good at explaining everything. She stresses the Word of the Bible as the definitive answer. Enjoy!",

While today the pope speaks to eliminate the death penalty, in the history of Rome, the popes used not only death, but terrible tortures to promote and protect his power. Her ultimate conclusion is that the Pope of Rome is the beast of Revelations (so Henry Kissinger can relax a bit). The mark of the beast is in setting aside the precepts laid down in scripture for the traditions invented by man (Sunday vs. Saturday worship, infant baptism, indulgences, worship of saints and Mary, ad infinitem).I recommend this book to any fundamentalist, evangelical, or liberal Christian thinker whether Protestant or Catholic, because it raises our awareness how church leaders can loose sight of the path set down by Jesus and instead promote superstitions set out by men who would use them to achieve and retain worldly power.",

She puts in plain words, how this should be an alarm to the whole world to return to the Bible and the Bible only as the only rule of faith, allowing scripture to interpret scripture, just as Jesus did while on this earth.

She has clothed herself in Christlike garments; but she is unchanged. Every principle of the papacy that existed in past ages exists today. The doctrines devised in the darkest ages are still held. Let none deceive themselves. The papacy that Protestants are now so ready to honor is the same that ruled the world in the days of the Reformation, when men of God stood up, at the peril of their lives, to expose her iniquity.&quot;What are the churches of today doing? They are stumbling over themselves to become associated with the Roman Church.A few years back Harry Truman tried to appoint an ambassador to The Vatican, and was almost run out of office. But, Ron Reagan did it and there was very little outcry from the Protestant churches.The World Lutheran Church just signed a concordat with the Vatican that says that Luther was wrong! The Angelicans have done a similar agreement!One review says that she plagerized. If that is true than someone else said that these things would happen; where do they say exactly what she has said?She said there would be a rise in spiritualism, that the churches would be teaching that the dead go to heaven or hell at their death.

                "review/text": "Though it has been a few years ago since I read this book, this book is one of the most biblical books I have read on the &quot;lordship controversy&quot; that erupted during the late '80s/early '90s. The book contains contributions from various authors from the Reformed and Lutheran traditions. Some of the more notable essays were written by Michael Horton, Rich Ritchie, and Kim Riddlebarger. The authors are critical of both the &quot;free grace&quot; position of Zane Hodges, Charles Ryrie, and Earl Radmacher and the &quot;lordship&quot; position of John MacArthur, Kenneth Gentry, and Ernest Reisinger. The authors feel that the &quot;free grace&quot; scholars put a radical disjunction between justification and sanctification, while the &quot;lordship&quot; scholars make no distinction between faith and doing works. Horton et al. find the perfect and biblical balance: those justified will produce works of righteousness (against Hodges/Ryrie/Radmacher), but having faith in Christ is not the same as obeying God's law (against MacArthur/Gentry/Reisinger). Many will complain that the authors of this book are capitulating to the free grace position in a Reformed attire. However, that is not the case. The authors in the book strongly believe that those united to Christ will be morally and spiritually renewed from within. Their view of faith is not &quot;intellectual assent alone&quot; but a genuine &quot;faith in Christ alone&quot; (to say that the authors are promoting the former rather than the latter is to be ignorant of Reformation history and theology). Unfortunately, this book has been overshadowed by other books from the other camps (especially MacArthur's). The only criticism I have is that the book is at times incoherent because of the authors' varied backgrounds (as pointed out by Jonathan Koh below). Hence, you get someone like Strimple sounding a bit too &quot;MacArthurian&quot; than what a lot of Reformed and Lutheran readers would feel comfortable with. Despite that one criticism, this book should be read by all who are interested in what true repentance and sanctification are. Unfortunately, this book is out of print. Perhaps someday Baker Books will revive this book in a new print edition (or better, an expanded edition). The importance of this subject makes this book absolutely necessary to be put out in the market again.",

                "review/text": "Summary:A collection of essays in response to the controversy between John MacArthur and Zane Hodges. MacArthur favors the Lordship-salvation position and says that true, saving faith includes obedience. Zane Hodges says that faith is merely intellectual assent and it does not include obedience.The authors of the essays in this book argue against both MacArthur and Hodges. Critiquing MacArthur, they point out that while obedience follows faith, it is not itself a part of faith. Critiquing Hodges, they point out that faith is not merely intellectual assent; rather, it has three components: knowledge, assent, and trust. And, contrary to Hodges, obedience will result from true, saving faith. The book is broken into two sections. The first part looks at Scripture and the second part looks at the history of the debate as it developed in the Reformers and then the Puritans.Analysis:Exegetically, the book is weak. In fact the majority of the book is spent describing the position of Hodges and MacArthur and then of the positions as they existed in history (e.g. Warfield vs. Chafer). Much less time is spent describing the authors' own position and even less time (!) exegeting any Scripture passages. In fact I'm not sure it can be said that any passages of Scripture are exegeted. Instead, the authors provide their different verses and interpretations to some passages that all parties appeal to (the Rich Young Man passage).While I am in 100% agreement with the authors in this book, I find it frustrating that so little exegesis is being done. Like another more recent book which Michael Horton edited dealing with similar issues \"Justified\"(this time between John Piper and N. T. Wright), too much time is spent simply saying \"But this is what the Reformers thought...\" In the end, I'm tempted to say \"WHO CARES!?\" Why should anyone give a crap what the position of the Reformers taught if it's not in line with Scripture? Knowing that John Calvin or B.B. Warfield said \"so and so\" isn't going to help me respond to someone who tries to argue their case from Scripture. At best, I'll be able to show that they don't belong in the Reformed tradition.I'm giving the book two stars because it laid out the positions and distinctions clearly between MacArthur, Hodges, and the others. I'm giving the book another star (totaling 3, for the mathematically challenged) because I agree with the authors of the book. But ultimately Michael Horton & Co. are going to have to rely on something more than their tradition if they want convince more than those who are already convinced.",

                "review/text": "I'm one who has read quite a bit into the Lordship Salvation debate. This debate really is about the gospel and thus it is a very important subject!This book edited by Horton is definitely a must-read for those who want to explore into this debate. I've been blessed by some articles in modern Reformation (the magazine that Horton edits) which has made me seen the debate in a new light. The magazine articles and this book has also made me changed my thinking from a pro-Lordship, MacArthur/Walter Chantry style, to a more balanced but yet confused (!!) person.Two complains about this book. Firstly, I think Horton is quite unfair towards Hodges. Though Horton remains one of my favourite authors, I didn't really like the treatment of Hodges in this book.Secondly, because of the varied nature of the book and the different views of the different authors, there was a lack in unity overall.But the book is refreshing in that it approaches the subject from a historical view - from the Reformation.I liked Horton's criticism of MacArthur's teachings - not because i like to see criticism, but because i thought through the criticisms the issues were made clearer. I'm not sure MacArthur has changed totally because of this book, though I know he has changed his views a bit.Rick Ritche's chapter on &quot;The Law According to Jesus&quot; was enlightening and it provided a very lutheran view on the law-gospel. This view contradicted many a pro-Lordship's view on the &quot;Rich Young Ruler&quot; passage - a passage that many pro-Lordship advocates use to defend their view.Horton's &quot;Christ Crucified between Two thieves&quot; provided a insightful look into these same issues which occured in Church history.Riddlebarger's &quot;What is Faith?&quot; chapter is good in that it clarified what faith is - not repentance, but knowledge, assent and trust alone!And Rosenbladt's chapter on &quot;Christ died for the sins of Christians, too&quot; gave a good Lutheran end to this issue - the importance of realising that Christ's death and His benefits are always there for the Christian.Once again, a must reading for those into this debate.",

They wisely bring the light of Church history into the discussion since this controversy has already been dealt with in the history of the church. The authors of this book very persuasively put forth their argument that whereas salvation is God's sovereign free gift bestowed on His Church not depending upon man, it always results in good works. The error of &quot;free grace&quot; is that justification is divorced from the doctrine of good works while the error of &quot;lordship&quot; is that justification is confused with good works. IN other words, justification is always followed by sanctification; justification and sanctification are inseparable but distinct. Horton et al have indeed answered this &quot;controversy&quot; so succinctly and conclusively, it should come as no surprise that MacArther has modified his &quot;lordship&quot; view to be in concord with this book.",

If these traits sound familiar, then you may be an Everyday Genius--an ordinary person of unusual vision who breaks the mold and isn't afraid to push progress forward. . . . As thought-provoking as Daniel Goleman's Emotional Intelligence, psychologist Mary-Elaine Jacobsen's Gifted Adults draws on a wide range of groundbreaking research and her own clinical experience to show America's twenty million gifted adults how to identify and free their extraordinary potential. Gifted Adults presents the first practical tool for rating your Evolutionary Intelligence Quotient through an in-depth personality-type profile. Demystifying what it means to be a gifted adult, this book offers practical guidance for eliminating self-sabotage and underachievement, helping Everyday Geniuses and those who know, love, and work with them to understand and support the exceptional gifts inherent in these unique personality traits.",

                "review/text": "&quot;The Gifted Adult&quot; is an excellent book, and provides one of a few lone voices drawing attention to &quot;A Group Society Would Rather Pretend Doesn't Exist:&quot; The Gifted Adult.Adult Giftedness is one of the &quot;Ugly Stepchildren&quot; in the field of Psychology. Whereas researchers, psychologists and society in general go to great lengths to study, understand and help those who dwell a long way below the mean intellect, those living their lives an equal distance the opposite side of the mean often find themselves living in a void of confusion, misunderstanding-- and misinformation. Their lives are perhaps complicated by a &quot;split personality&quot; support system that provides tools and special programs to gifted children, but then vanishes into thin air once the gifted individual is deemed &quot;Adult&quot;-- in some cases providing an abrupt perception change from giftedness as having positive &quot;value&quot; to suddenly being a reason for discrimination and sneers.Gifted Adults are &quot;statistical outliers.&quot; As such, they often have special issues, living in a world whose actions are centered around accommodating the &quot;norm.&quot; At best, a Gifted Adult seeking to have his/her needs understood, may hear the words &quot;Well, we're ALL gifted, in our own special way.&quot; At worst (and more frequently) they will hear &quot;How can you have problems, if you're so smart?&quot;-- words that reflect a popular view that giftedness is a &quot;privilege&quot; that exempts a person from having any difficulties in life. Yet, Gifted Adults discover that working harder, seeking answers, seeing therapists and trying to contribute often leaves them with a sense of &quot;emptiness&quot; and lack of fulfillment.Mary-Elaine Jacobsen's book is a much-needed tool to help gifted adults understand themselves, and accept the fact that their brains work a little bit differently. Real differences, I might add, that change the way a gifted person views their interactions with the world, their road to self-actualization, or considerations for seeking therapy.In Part I of the book, Jacobsen starts to define her own view of giftedness, and addresses some of the Societal Myths (Giftedness = High IQ), and influences (Gifted adults' tendency to deny their giftedness) established by conventional thinking.In Part II, she presents her alternative theory for measuring giftedness-- a broad system she has named &quot;Evolutionary Intelligence&quot; (or EvIQ). Although Jacobsen &quot;borrows&quot; heavily from the &quot;Multiple Intelligences&quot; theory originally set forth by Howard Gardner at Harvard, she adds a number of new facets, presented in a 240-item &quot;self quiz&quot; in Chapter 7 of the book. Unlike &quot;standard&quot; IQ tests, this is NOT a timed exercise with &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; answers, but rather a self-evaluation. Of course, honest self-scrutiny is central to obtaining a &quot;valid&quot; result-- which may present difficulty for some.Part III explores most of the common &quot;misunderstandings&quot; gifted adults encounter in their interactions with daily life. Topics include &quot;self mis-diagnoses;&quot; the issues associated with &quot;Failing to Fit In;&quot; rewriting personal history and past events through understanding &quot;common criticisms&quot; often heard by gifted adults (&quot;Can't you just stick with ONE thing?&quot; &quot;Where do you get those wild ideas?&quot; &quot;Can't you just slow down?&quot;); the &quot;False Self&quot; and dumbing yourself down; as well as the &quot;Impostor Syndrome&quot; gifted adults often experience.Parts IV and V offer a series of tools and possible solutions to help gifted adults reorient their energies in an effort to create lives that let them be &quot;true to themselves&quot;-- while still fitting into the &quot;normalcy&quot; of their surroundings. In part IV, Jacobsen explores both career issues and personal relationships, however, I found this section to be a bit general and &quot;pep-talkish.&quot; The final section deals with summarizing and then applying the lessons learned in the book.Observations: My general inclination is to say &quot; Buy this book! Buy it NOW! Read it! Learn!&quot;However, the potential reader should understand just what the book will do for them. &quot;The Gifted Adult&quot; (Formerly published under the name &quot;Liberating Everyday Genius&quot;-- the name change is a GOOD idea!) is long on presenting Jacobsen's theory of Evolutionary Intelligence, and long on providing self-understanding for the gifted adult-- but somewhat short as a &quot;How-To&quot; guidebook on how to live life. If you're looking for &quot;connect A to B&quot; solutions, you'll find only a limited number here.The author is also quite &quot;liberal&quot; with her use of the designation &quot;gifted.&quot; Normally, the term is used to describe approximately 2% of the population. Jacobsen's definition may include as many as 10%-- and whether this is merely a technique to sell more books, or a figure backed by scientific research, I do not know. It doesn't detract materially from the value of the information presented-- but at times the writing does become a little bit &quot;fluffy&quot; and lacking in focus.Some personal thoughts (Caveats): Society is engaged in a long-term love affair with the idea of &quot;pathologizing&quot; any behavior not tightly clustered around a narrow definition of &quot;Normal.&quot; Incorrectly diagnosing and medicating giftedness as ADHD or Bipolar Disorder responds to a popular need for &quot;A Quick And Easy Fix.&quot; If AT ALL possible, we want a &quot;magic pill&quot; rather than &quot;hard work.&quot; And whereas disorders certainly DO occur, Adult Giftedness-- and the psychological makeup specific to it-- is NOT a pathology.Overall rating: Outstanding (9.5 bookmarks out of a possible 10), not only for the gifted adult and anyone living with a gifted adult, but the book also should be required reading for any psychologist/therapist who's been asked if they are &quot;familiar with the psychology of Adult Giftedness.&quot;",

Unfortunately, most of what it offers is mere information and theory regarding what \"everyday genius\" is and how to tell if you are one using a rather generic \"test.\" It then goes on to dispel myths and stereotypes that most \"geniuses\" seem to experience. I know that I found a lot of myself in this book although I'm not sure I'd call myself a genius. Perhaps I overestimate what the term really means, thus fitting in to the descriptions she gives of how society pushes down anyone who thinks differently than the majority. Sadly, none of my big questions were answered such as, \"how do I overcome this programming?\" I am just as confused and feel just as alone as I did prior to reading the book, so I can't say it has been any help to me except to point out that maybe there are others out there like me. What's the point if I still feel too lost to find them and to express my \"true\" self? Much of the material is repetitive in that she presents the same ideas and concepts over and over again. I assume she's trying to drill it into the head of the reader, but perhaps it's just book filler. I think she could have compacted the material into a book half the original size, thus lowering the price in the process. If you buy it, expect to be reading a Tony Robbins type self-esteem booster...do not expect to find real answers.",

                "review/text": "In general, I found this book very enlightening. I differ in one respect from most of the &quot;everyday geniuses&quot; the author describes: early in life I was identified as having a high IQ. But my parents and teachers suffered from the misconception that this was an isolated trait and, in all other respects, I was a completely normal child. It was fine with them that I learned quickly, but the qualities that they found less agreeable (my determination, enthusiasm, sensitivity, and immensely wide variety of interests) were redefined as negatives: I was &quot;stubborn,&quot; &quot;unfocused,&quot; &quot;hasty,&quot; &quot;too emotional,&quot; and so on. Plus the ideals that I was supposed to achieve -- get straight A's in school, be quiet and well-behaved, specify a career goal and pursue it -- didn't appeal to me in the least; I didn't want an ordinary life, I wanted an extraordinary one. But I grew up believing that, by refusing to squeeze myself into the slots that society provided, I was &quot;failing to live up to my potential.&quot;It wasn't until recently that I learned that there's more to giftedness than a high IQ or a talent in a particular area. Palladino's &quot;Dreamers, Discoverers, and Dynamos,&quot; Gardner's work on &quot;multiple intelligences,&quot; and many other books point out that the gifted child's mind actually works differently: intensity, drive, and sensitivity are all part of the package (which Palladino characterizes as &quot;divergent thinking&quot;). But the dividing line between genius and ADD is a blurry one, and our educational system's emphasis on normality and conformity often leads to defining any &quot;divergence&quot; as pathological or, at best, as misbehavior.This book is a great antidote to such thinking. The author gives a self-test that enables the &quot;everyday genius&quot; to identify his/her strengths and personality traits, and I found the results interesting. Also very helpful are the lengthy sections on redefining your supposed negatives as positives: you're not someone who needs to &quot;slow down&quot;; doing things quickly is normal for you. I was greatly reassured to discover that my burning desire to &quot;make a difference in the world&quot; didn't stem from arrogance (which more than one teacher had scolded me for), but was, rather, a typical part of the high-EvI package. Although I don't agree with all of the author's suggestions in the &quot;self-help&quot; chapters, I think she's making an important point: the &quot;everyday genius&quot; can live and work effectively in the world not by suppressing his/her strengths, but by practicing self-discipline to use these strengths in the service of a higher goal. Given the scarcity of books written specifically for gifted adults (rather than children), this book fills a great need, and does it well.I have only one quibble with the book, but it caused me to rate it with four stars rather than five. The author says things like &quot;studies have shown ...&quot;, but she almost never gives the references for these studies; the footnotes to the chapters rarely mention research at all. I realize that she's writing a &quot;popular&quot; book rather than a scholarly work, and that many of her conclusions are based on her experience with her clients rather than on scientific research. But I feel it would give her conclusions far more credibility if she backed them up with harder data.",

As an intense, complex and driven gifted adult, myself, I truly appreciate her contribution to my life and the lives of others I know who've read the book. As a therapist to gifted adults for many years, Jacobsen knows what she's talking about and gives us many moving stories to find ourselves, our friends or our parents in. I cried many tears reading this book, remembering experiences in my own life and seeing them in a more self-compassionate light.I've known I was smart, intense and driven but Jacobsen helped me to see why and what to do about it to have a happier, more fulfilled life. I'm probably writing this review right now because of the influence of this book. I've always craved to get my ideas out in the world and here on the Net and in my blog (tokerud's technology treats) I've sought out ways to do that. Jacobsen gives the gifted adult the good news and the bad news. The good news is great. I can forgive myself. The bad news is, that the only way things are going to change is for me to change some bad habits and be constructive and persistent in the world and express my gifts. If you know you are intense and driven and probably pretty smart, pick this book up. It could change YOUR life too.This book is a well-written but occasionally dense read. However, it will be a page-turner for a gifted adult. And, for that matter, gifted adults tend to like dense books. One of the unfortunate facts that Jacobsen points out is that gifted adults have usually learned to keep a low profile about their giftedness. They've learned to cover it up and at a certain point in their lives, many gifted adults forget they are gifted. It is a convenient but, ultimately, very harmful defense mechanism. That's why I said earlier that if you merely suspect you might possibly be a gifted adult, read this book! It will shake you out of your unconsciousness and get you back on the track of getting your gifts out into the world where they belong!",

I was meant to be a swan.&quot;While some reviewers criticize this book as &quot;elitist,&quot; I find the opposite. Jacobsen doesn't suggest that anyone be exempt from social norms or rules. To the contrary, she shows that the gifted may face a tougher challenge than the less-gifted: they must learn to accommodate to a society as an invisible often-resented minority group. It's up to each gifted person -- hopefully aided by mentors who can take advantage of &quot;teaching moments&quot; -- to learn to swim. That means adjusting a blunt style of speaking, communicating in a new style and, always, dealing with the loneliness of being &quot;different.&quot; Gifted people tend to attract envy, not empathy, and they don't always grow into rich and successful adults. Indeed, without recognition early in life, the gifted can become severely depressed, mainly due to isolation.Once you read this book, it's easy to recognize evidence of giftedness in yourself and others, including autobiographical accounts. A combination of characteristics -- sensitivity, high-speed, high-energy -- can appear frustrating to those who don't realize what's going on. Many gifted children get diagnosed as hyperactive, depressed, socially inept and worse.I'm not overfond of pencil-and-paper tests, but Jacobsen offers ways to identify specific areas of giftedness through some simple questions. Readers can ignore this part if they choose.Counselors, career coaches, therapists, managers, guidance professionals -- all should have this book on their shelves.

As it was, in reading this book, I found that the descriptions of the author's &quot;gifted&quot; patients could just as well have been used by the authors of &quot;Distraction&quot; to describe their patients. Additionally, the author's descriptions of the traits of &quot;gifted&quot; adults are essentially the same as those that could be used to describe the very smart hyperactive impulsive individual with ADHD. Only in this book, those same traits are given a positive spin. For example, when her &quot;gifted&quot; adults get into trouble by saying whatever is on their mind (i.e., not editing anything before it comes out), they aren't being impulsive, they are just being &quot;truthful&quot; in a way others don't want to hear. And when their impulsivity leads them to be impatient with others, it is just that everyone else in the world is too slow. All of that being said, the author's specific suggestions for dealing with those traits are helpful. We just need to do more to understand the neuro-chemistry of thing called ADHD or the neuro-chemistry of being &quot;gifted&quot; (a subject there appears to be zero research on, no doubt because &quot;gifted&quot; is terminology developed in the educational field and not the medical field). If the traits the author describes as &quot;gifted&quot; are really just the way those highly intelligent people act when there is a dopamine dis-regulation in their brains (the problem with ADHD), we need to look at this. As the other reviewer said, it is all a matter of which part of the elephant one is looking at -- the author is looking at one part and the ADHD researchers are looking at another. Meanwhile, those labeled &quot;ADHD&quot; are disserved by notions that their traits are all negative and those that are labeled &quot;gifted&quot; are disserved by not understanding the entire picture -- and the possible positive effects of ADHD treatment.",

                "review/text": "Anyone who reads English mystery novels or who watches British TV series (especially those intended only for domestic viewing, where the writers haven't made allowances for a residual U.S. audience) occasionally runs into slang and cant that is part of the mental furniture of most Brits but which can be puzzling to Americans. I imagine everyone knows what a &quot;lift&quot; or a &quot;lorry&quot; is (neither of which is included in this book), but where in the world is &quot;Honkers&quot;? And what are &quot;maggies&quot; or &quot;nadgers&quot;? Having spent some time in Britain, and counting a number of Brits among my friends and colleagues, and being a student of language (I'm an editor), I'm always interested in books like this -- but this one is a decided disappointment, lacking in many areas.First: There are many words and phrases here that aren't exclusively, or even predominantly, British, including &quot;graft,&quot; &quot;grand&quot; (meaning a thousand dollars or pounds), &quot;gold widow,&quot; &quot;push-start&quot; (referring to an automobile), &quot;foodie,&quot; &quot;take a pew,&quot; and &quot;the mind boggles.&quot;Second: The author includes words that are certainly British but are not slang in any sense of the word, such as &quot;longstop&quot; and &quot;googly.&quot; These are simply technical terms in cricket -- and the author doesn't both to explain what they actually mean, or their derivation, in any case.Third: There are quite a few *good* inclusions for which a simple meaning is provided, but which really ought to have had more etymological detail. What *is* the &quot;spanner&quot; that gets in the works? *Why* is a convertible called a &quot;drophead&quot;? Where does the &quot;spare&quot; come from in &quot;go spare&quot;?Fourth: There's far too much rhyming slang in this slender volume -- maybe a third of the listings -- and the majority of them aren't even close to being &quot;contemporary,&quot; as the title claims. I ran a number of these laborered constructions past my Brit friends, and they had never heard them, either. Does *anyone* who isn't being self-consciously cute refer to a waistcoat as a &quot;Jimmy Prescott&quot;? Does anyone outside Ascot even *wear* a waistcoat? And I note that the crude term &quot;Kermit,&quot; meaning a Frenchman (a &quot;frog,&quot; that is) is also described as rhyming slang, which it isn't.Fifth: I know no such compilation could ever be complete, but I was able to think almost immediately of a number of reasonably common, non-obvious terms you won't find here, such as &quot;Oz&quot; for Australia, &quot;dropsy&quot; for a bribe, and &quot;lifted&quot; for being arrested. Also, James includes &quot;go down a treat&quot; (speaking of food) but makes no mention of the more threatening (and more common) &quot;do you a treat, mate.&quot; There's no information regarding the author's background for this sort of assignment, but it can't have been much.",

                "review/text": "Humphrey's book has two major virtues that every book should have: it is very entertaining (in an intelligent way), and it actually manages to make a couple of novel points, which is more than can be said for a lot of contemporary publishing... The topic of &quot;Leaps of faith&quot; is what seems to be the eternal (but is in fact only about a couple of centuries old) battle between science and myth. Where &quot;myth&quot; includes the paranormal and in general, explanations of the world around us that are non-naturalistic, or transcendental. Telepathy, psychokinesis, ghosts, and the power of prayer are all under fire in this fascinating compendium of skepticism and logic. But, Humphrey criticizes the usual ways in which scientists have defended their skeptical position, such as directly challenging people like Uri Geller (the infamous &quot;spoon-and-fork-bender&quot;). The author explains that some courageous approaches to the rebuttal of the paranormal may be dangerous and ineffective. For example, the notorious magician James Randi has for years challenged people to bring forth claims of paranormal phenomena. Randi offers a prize if he cannot repeat by perfectly normal means the supposedly supernatural feat. However, Humphrey points out that there are two flaws in this strategy. First, just because James Randi (or whomever) can imitate a phenomenon by normal means, that does not automatically prove that the phenomenon itself is not genuinely paranormal. Second, what if some day the good Randi is actually unable to duplicate a supposedly paranormal phenomenon? Does para-Randi imply para-normal? Of course not, but since it is possible - indeed likely - that Randi's abilities are limited, his strategy might dramatically and embarassingly backfire one of these days... What's the alternative? What the author refers to as the &quot;argument from unwarranted design&quot;. It works quite simply and convincingly. Humphrey asks what are the circumstances surrounding the manifestation of paranormal phenomena, regardless of what specific phenomenon (telepathy, psychokinesis, miracles, or what have you) has allegedly occurred. There is no a priori reason why these circumstances should not be as varied as the human beings, times, and countries in which they purportedly happen. But upon even a superficial scrutiny, we do not find anything like a random background. Somehow, paranormal phenomena always manage to occur under circumstances that can be quite reasonably defined as &quot;suspicious&quot;. Either there is only one witness, or they can never be repeated in front of an investigator, or their physical evidence somehow disappears without leaving a trace. Indeed, even parapsycologists recognize this, and have elevated it to a &quot;principle&quot;, which states that for whatever reason, the presence of an investigator, or of circumstances leading to repeatability (the cornerstone of scientific investigation), somehow &quot;depress&quot; the likelihood of the paranormal phenomenon actually happening. Now, would you by a car if the salesman insists that the car will start only when he is present? But Humphrey goes even beyond the unwarranted design argument, twisting around an old favorite of mystic-oriented people. The usual tenet of many religious people and believers in the paranormal is that &quot;the world wouldn't make sense without it&quot; (where &quot;it&quot; is some sort of supernatural or transcendental power). Actually, the author of &quot;Leaps of faith&quot; argues, it is quite the opposite. If indeed the soul existed, if there really were a way to maintain your personal self forever, if you could bypass the laws of physics and read people minds or move objects without touching them, the whole fabric of the universe would simply be torn apart! Why live a meaningful life on Earth, if you know that it is only an irrelevant and astonishingly brief moment in your &quot;true&quot; existence? Could you really stand the idea that every single thought you think, no matter how remote in your subconscious, can be public knowledge by a simple act of will on someone else's part? And what would be the meaning of the laws regulating the universe, if they could be broken at any given occasion? Would you really like to take the chance every time you walk out of the front door that the law of gravity might have been temporarily suspended ? Meditate, people, meditate...",

Then there is this wonderful book by Nicholas Humphrey. Where other would-be Rationalists fail, Humphrey succeeds. He lays out for us elegantly, reasonably, sanely and with humour and compassion, the Materialist case; pointing out more succintly than anyone else I've read the flaws, not only in the logic of &quot;Paranormalists&quot;, but many of the logical flaws &quot;debunkers&quot; fall into. The style of the book is relaxed and conversational, honest and straightforward and enjoyable. Sane medicine for the intellect. Highly recommended.",

                "review/text": "There are now, thankfully, a number of very good books debunking paranormal beliefs (Shermer's Why People Believe Weird Things, Sagan's Demon Haunted World, for example). Most provide a devasting critique of those beliefs and almost all approach belief in the paranormal in a similiar manner. Humphrey provides some new arguments and insights and hence, Leaps of Faith serves as both a great introduction to skeptical literature and as a source of new insight for people who have already sorted through most of the traditional arguments against the existence of supernatural forces in our daily life.Humphrey's 'Argument from Unwarranted Design' turns out to be an incredible analytical tool and he uses it compellingly in a number of contexts. While most author's content themselves with trotting out the litany of scientific disproofs of the supernatural, Humphrey raises logical objections to alleged paranormal phenomena. Why should strange little phenonoma such as spoon bending bother to exist at all? How and why would they have been created in contravention to the rules of science and the dictates of normally parsimonious design? In short, Humphrey makes a strong case that the supernatural is both empirically AND logically unlikely.One more thing, Humphrey has a very readable style. If the concepts sound complicated and off-putting, they become vivid and immediate as Humphrey gives simple examples and compelling illustrations. Wonderful to read!Buy the book!",

Without hesitation the author shows that they are not just unscientific but actually anti-scientific. It may not convince the die hard &quot;believers&quot; but who could? The supernatural hypothesis will always win by default -- it is unbeatable, not because it is right but because one can always invoke those powers as to having done everything to confuse us.

                "review/text": "The chapter title above perfectly synopsizes Humphrey's aim in writing this book. A long-time scholar of &quot;paranormal&quot; phenomena, he is well suited to examine and explain the foundations for belief in the irrational. A skeptical critic and insightful observer, he brings many years of experience to present this assessment of the &quot;paranormal&quot;. He is anxious to dispel the emotional delusions of supposedly extrasensory experiences. Such events must not overwhelm reason, he argues. In this well-written and researched book, Humphrey examines how science has addressed and answered many questions over the centuries.Religions and quasi-religions, he contends, are nurturing and explanatory medicinal packages for &quot;orphaned minds&quot;. Seeking consolation, distressed people will cling to such weak reeds with desperate intensity. Attempts to assert rationality over many years have been repulsed or constrained by those who had easy answers to probing questions. The easy answer has always been found outside the realm of nature - the &quot;super&quot;-natural. While these answers are nearly universal, Humphrey focusses on Western European traditions and illusions. Of these, naturally, it is the Christ story which claims his attention.Humphrey's handling of the Messiah phenomenon is unique. Jesus, instead of a &quot;redeemer&quot;, is portrayed as a skillful conjurer from a young age. Using modern child prodigies as models, Humphrey suggests that Jesus, too, exhibited extraordinary talents in childhood. These need not have been &quot;supernatural&quot;, but they certainly garnered attention. Following the example of a father-son mutually reinforcing alliance to perform &quot;spoon-bending&quot; feats, he suggests Jesus was the victim of a &quot;virtuous circle&quot; of family and friends encouraging him. While those in his home town remained skeptical, Jesus' talents in sleight-of-hand were applauded elsewhere. The acclaim grew widespread enough that even non-Christian paranormal practitioners rely on the model Jesus established. It's a compelling idea, both in accepting an historical Jesus while explaining how supposedly irrational events can gain wide-spread acceptance.Readers are well-served by Humphrey's efforts to shunt the paranormal aside and replace it with analytical considerations of miracles, &quot;psychic&quot; phenomena and charlatanry. These habits are too easily ingrained into common thinking simply because they fulfill a desire to envision a future. Science, according to Humphrey, has failed to address the paranormal so as not to give it the credibility of attention. Perhaps a full-scale campaign, he contends, would dispel the myths and leave the gullible public in a more enlightened state. It would, he suggests, help dispel the disquieting view so much of the public has of science. Whether to understand the paranormal's tactics or to see why it should be fully discounted, this book is an excellent analysis of a dubious topic. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",
