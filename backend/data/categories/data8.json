                "review/text": "Hachiko is a wonderful young puppy who lives with his master, Professor Ueno. Each morning the Professor tells Hachiko these same words, as he boards the train: \"What a good dog you are. What a fine dog you are. Hachi you are the best dog in all of Japan.\" And every afternoon, at 3 o'clock on the dot, Hachiko arives back at the train station to greet his owner once again. However, one day, the Professor doesn't step off the train. So Hachiko waits. He waits for ten years. Not even the kind young boy known as Yasuo can persuade Hachiko to leave his post, and take shelter in a warm home. Soon Hachiko is known around the country, and the world, as the dog who never gave up on his owner's return.I love animal stories, and I've always been interested in the Japanese culture, so I adored HACHIKO WAITS. Leslea Newman has done a marvelous job of capturing the love an animal - whether a dog, cat, etc. - holds for his or her owner, as long as they treat him/her well. The prose is wonderful, and will hold young readers enamored for hours, while the gorgeous black and white illustrations by Machiyo Kodaira bring the story even more to life. This is an absolute must read for all animal lovers.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper",

                "review/text": "There is a statue of a dog in the Shibuya train station in Tokyo. It was first set in place in 1934 to commemorate the loyalty and devotion of an Akita who waited for his master for ten years. The master was a university teacher, who died unexpectedly at work. It was the Akita's habit to wait for his master's return from work then walk home together. Because he could not understand why his master did not return, he faithfully waited until he died in his place at the station, where the statue was erected in his honor. This is the dry version of a true story.\"What a good dog you are. What a fine dog you are. Hachi, you are the best dog in Japan.\" These are the words Professor Ueno speaks to his Akita everyday at the train station just before he departs for his teaching job at the university. And they are the last words Hachi ever hears the professor say. The dog waits until the station is closed and the train master encourages him to go outside the gate.A little boy whom the professor befriends, Yasuo and his mother take the dog in, but Hachi is one of those rare one-master-only dogs. He escapes. No one knows where he goes during the day or night, but each afternoon at five minutes until three, Hachi reappears to wait until closing. This continues for ten years.Meanwhile, people begin to notice Hachi. They pet him, worry about him, feed him, offer to take him, write newspaper stories about him, come from far and near just to see him. He becomes a symbol of the devoted, loyal dog, man's best friend. Through it all, Hachi remains calm, but most importantly, patient. He waits for his master.Today, Hachi's story is told in Japanese schools all across the country. Each year he is honored during a special ceremony at the Shibuya train station at the foot of Hachi's statue. During his lifetime he was proclaimed Chuken Hachiko (Chuken=faithful dog, -iko, a term of respect), for people loved, respected, and honored him for this total loyalty. Still, this is the dry version.In a historical novel a writer is allowed a certain freedom or license to get into the story and bring the reader with her. Leslea Newman and artist Machiyo Kodaira take the reader right there on that train station, right there beside Hachido, feeling his extraordinary devotion and dedication. Right there with each person who attends Hachiko. We are right there as Yasuo grows into a man and watch him meet a young woman. Early in the story the train master tells Yasuo that his promise to care for Hachi will bring him an unexpected happy result. And so it does. This is a story not to miss.Being inside the story with Hachiko and all the people whose lives he touches and influences is the wet version. For there is no way you can escape deep emotion reading this story. The tears will come, but they are cleansing tears. Hachiko will win your heart.",

                "review/text": "Hachiko, a beautiful golden brown Akita pup is the loved and revered pet of his owner, Professor Ueno. The curly tailed dog was named Hachi because Professor Ueno considered the Japanese character for the number of 8 fortunate. This is his 8th Akita and he feels the dog has very special qualities. Professor Ueno and his dog walked to the commuter station each morning. Hachiko would trot back to the Shibuya station every afternoon at 3:00. The station master said that one could set their clock by Hachiko.In May of 1925, some 15 months after buying Hachiko, Professor Ueno died suddenly at work. His loyal dog continued to wait at the train station for him, even though others made overtures to him. The fictional subplot of Yasuo, a young boy who first sees the dog and meets Professor Ueno at age 5 and his partial ownership of the dog when his owner dies is moving and lovely. So are the beautiful illustrations that grace this book.This is a wonderful book about cultural sharing; I like the way Japanese words are included along with a glossary and a thumbnail history of Japanese foods and traditions.This is a beautiful book that might make you cry, but it is well worth the read. People of all ages will love the gentle Professor and his loyal Akita who never gave up waiting for his owner to return.In 1935 Hachiko was immemorialized in statue form as the symbol of unflagging devotion. Hachiko, like another curly tailed dog, the malamute Balto, who in 1925 braved an Alaskan blizzard to bring in a shipment of medicine share a history of being immemorialized in statue form and were recognized for their unflagging spirits.",

Everyone at the train station leaves him there to take care of Hachiko. The genre is this book is realistic fiction.This book was exciting to me because it was a book about dogs and any dog who waits for his master is the greatest dog in the world. I would recommend this book to people who like dog books. There are many books to find, but you have to choose the right one. A teen or younger might like this book. Yes this book was a page-turner because it was exciting to see what would happen to Hachika. I enjoyed this book because it was about dogs.The story made me like the genre because you never knew what was going to happen.

I think the author has written something much more than a book about a wonderful dog named Amy. Behind that captivating story is a meditation on the inevitability of the passage of time, almost an inquiry into the meaning of time and memory. Look at it: all the action takes place in a tiny geographic area, maybe a square mile at most. Very subtly moving across this canvas are the people whose lives touched this square mile--from prehistoric man to Indians and Pilgrims to pirates and finshermen and World War I aviators. Way behind the scenes there's a reference to great-grandparents, and grandparents and parents. A day in the past, the author seems to be saying, was their time, today is ours, tomorrow others will walk these same beaches, and that will be their day. I think it may well be this very quiet undercurrent that gives this slim book its punch and unforgettable power. I'd be interested to hear if any other readers have felt this too.",

Two serious heart attacks and open-heart surgery had taken away most of the good things that he had in his life. However, his doctors still held out hope for him, and they were trying to find ways to motivate him to get out of the house and exercise. Their vision was that an energetic dog on a leash might do that for Mike. And so it was that this golden retriever named Dakota, who had been rescued from death himself, came to help Mike with his rehabilitative therapy. Eventually, Dakota became Mike's protector and his best friend, saving Mike's life several times after somehow learning how to alert Mike of oncoming heart crises. Dakota gave Mike back his dignity, his pride, and his life. Early on, it became evident to Mike that this wonderful 98-pound, red-haired, four-legged angel had a special gift: Dakota was a spirit guide, and it was Mike's duty to share him and the power of the human-animal bond. Ultimately, as part of that journey, one more miracle was needed, as Dakota fought a courageous and dignified battle for his own life.",

Beware...you will need a box of Kleenex when you read this book.",

But I assure you, being unfamiliar with the subject didn't affect my enjoyment of the book at all. In fact, I felt guilty that my Brittany, Pointer and Weimaraner have never had such experiences.

Rather, it is a chronicle, a diary of the life of Rufus with Gusewelle from a pup until maturity at 13 seasons. It has plenty of dog lore, from puppyhood to middle age to advanced years, seemingly paralleling the stages of the author's own life. Along the way, we read pearls of wisdom, such as: &quot;\"I've seen people wear out, forget their purpose. But, an old bird dog, when autumn comes, always can smell tomorrow on the wind.&quot; And: &quot;There's no surer way to friendship than to praise a stranger's dog.&quot; Or, &quot;a morning hunt's missed is one you'll never have again.&quot; Chronicle is a time well spent, foraging in the fields of the heart.",

The question that has always interested dog owners is: \"Do they talk back?\" BOTTLE-CAP SUNDAES is a hilarious, heartwarming story of three dachshunds: Mozart, Elvis, and Whoopi, that answers that question in their own words. Mozart is the first Canine-American in the history of the family. Being the only dog in the house is pretty heady stuff for young Mozart. Then the twins arrive. Elvis and Whoopi are black miniature dachshunds who immediately fall in love with Mozart. The feeling is not mutual. They soon become constant companions who relate their experiences and feelings on subject like kennels, sibling rivalry, house training, and being neutered. They use their irreverent sense of humor to speak up for dog rights, needle each other, and one-up their owner. Their mannerisms, habits, and dialogue demonstrate three very different personalities. BOTTLE-CAP SUNDAES will bring enjoyment to any reader with a sense of humor, and is sure to strike a familiar chord with anyone who has ever owned a dog.",

Kind of a \"what are waiting for\" wake-up call. This is a really great read, perfect for animal lovers, for those who have taken life's knocks, and for all who dare to chase their dreams.",

Ouida, as she called her literary alter-ego, obviously traveled in the Low Countries, for she is conversant with both the Flemish people (city life, country life, general customs) and the foibles of human nature. The tale is frankly sentimental; one wonders if she is making a plea for social reform or communal conscience. I suspect that this story was not well received abroad; the city of Antwerp and the selfish villagers come off quite badly as a result of their shallow attitudes and callous indifference to povery, pain and hunger.A dog is elevated to having almost human feelings, while an innocent youth is rewarded for his simple faith--only after death. Too late for Society to make amends; all they can do is grant the pair a single grave. Few teens of the 90's would appreciate this syrupy tale of Patrasche's devotion and Nello's artistic apotheosis. Still the book may strike a responsive chord in the hearts of sensitive readers of all ages. A good read-aloud story for bedtime. This emotional tragedy highlights the art of the Baroque master, Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640). This Dover PB edition contains the original pen and ink sketches, which greatly enhance the story and our ability to &quot;see&quot; the characters.",

I didn't expect much, and I was surprised when I began to enjoy the story late in the book.The story is of a peasant boy, Nello, and his dog, Patrasche. The boy just wants to be an artist and see a painting by Rubens. The dog (who has very human feelings) just wants to help the boy reach his goal. The two face absolutely every hardship possible in their attempts.To enjoy this story, you have to take it in the context of the time it was written. The book is really, really sentimental. Every play for emotion possible is made by the author. Early in the book, it even says (in a literal tone) that Nello and his grandfather would just lay down and die if anything ever happened to the dog. Patrasche was their &quot;alpha and omega.&quot; All of the sentimentality really bothered me at the beginning. I'm used to modern writing and didn't take the overplay of emotion well. I had to take into account, though, that Ouida wrote in the romantic tradition, when this type of writing was common, especially in children's books. Looking at A Dog of Flanders as an example from the time period helped me to enjoy the novel even through its oversentimentality. Overall, A Dog of Flanders is a pretty decent read. Most children of today wouldn't love it. A Dog of Flanders is definately a worthy read as a curiosity piece, though.",

                "review/text": "`A Dog of Flanders: A Christmas Story` is a young adult book written by the Victorian English author Marie Louise de la Ram&eacute;e (aka \"Ouida\"). It's a sentimental animal fable, part of her lifelong campaign to draw attention to the problem of cruelty to dogs. It's set in Flanders where dogs are routinely worked to death. The hero of the story, a peasant boy named Nello, saves an old dog Patrsche from such a fate. When Nello falls impossibly in love outside his class with the millers daughter, Alois, his heart is broken when she is denied to him by her cruel father.I found the story pleasant and emotionally moving. It can be overly sentimental in that Victorian way, and has some Romantic Nationalism, but the story is good and leaves one with a positive feeling in the end. Although Ouida wrote over 40 novels and was very popular in her time, she is hardly read anymore, this childrens books appears now to be the most popular of her works. But in her time her most famous work wasUnder Two Flags(1867), which was still being published and read in the 20th century, including 4 different movie adaptations. Likewise `A Dog of Flanders` seems to have inspired at least 7 movies, as recently as 1999. It also sells well in Japan.For an audio version and scans of the original book with illustrations - see the comment below of this review.",

I found the personality test for the dog both interesting and helpful, and the distinction between dogs who react to fear with flight and those who react with aggression is important.The discussion of the test itself is detailed, and the training programs, particularly the ones that last several weeks, are helpful and practical. This test requires your dog to perform consistently, and that means practice! Learning how to structure a \"Stay\" program that will take 4 weeks to complete is critical if you really want a dog that can pass the test.However, the book was written more than 10 years ago, and the specific techniques rely heavily on physically moving the dog into place. There are some master trainers who can do that, but these days most humane societies and group trainers don't advise amateurs to use those methods unsupervised.For example, the book says that with some dogs, when teaching \"Sit,\" \"You may have to physically place them. With your left hand, stroke down the entire length of the back, over the tail all the way to the stifles, and with equal pressure of the right and left hands, fold the dog into a sit with the command 'Sit.'\"I don't know of any book written in the last 5 years that would recommend this method for home training. Instead, the preferred method is shaping and patience--reward the dog for each effort towards the desired behaviour. Almost all dogs will eventually get there, and the shaping method is usually safer and more reliable for amateurs.This book uses similar physical manipulation techniques throughout. That's really the only reason I can't give it a higher rating.I recommend that you get any other good recent book on training for ways of teaching the individual Sit, Down, Heel and Stay behaviours. Then use this book for working out a training schedule specifically to prepare for the Canine Good Citizenship Test.Most other books are going to talk as though your dog will have Heel mastered in a session or two. And it's true the dog will learn the basic command that quickly. But to truly MASTER it, you will need something like the 8 week training schedule that the Volhards lay out in this book.There's a lot to learn from this book, and some very practical tips. But you'll also need a current book specifically for amateur trainers to teach the individual techniques--or take a class from your local humane society or work with a local trainer to get the basics.",

Ultimately this is a book about educating people about how to help their dogs learn good people manners.While the context is preparing for the American Kennel Club's Canine Good Citizen test, really this book is for any dog owner. If you have a family dog that needs a little help in learning good people manners, this is the book for you. If you are already involved in competitive dog sports, such as obedience trials or have experience in dog training, this book has not really been written for you.The Canine Good Citizen test involves 10 individual tests, all of which allow the dog to show that she well mannered in everyday situations. For example two of the tests include the dog must sit politely while being petted by a stranger, and walk politely on leash through a crowd.Whether you ever test your dog or not, teaching these skills to your dog will result in a dog that is well behaved, a joy to be around. Isn't that what everyone really wants for their family dog?For me, the best parts of the book are those that coach you on how to work with your dog, how to understand the dog's psychology - how dogs learn. This has been invaluable to me. Early in the book, the authors introduce the idea that dogs are, of course, pack animals. Our human family becomes their pack, and someone has to be the leader of the pack. For everyone's sake, the leader of the pack must be one of the people - not the dog. The Volhards help you understand how to be the pack leader. This is not hard to do and certainly does not require you to be unkind to your dog. Our dog has learned these lessons well enough that she even cheerfully takes commands from our 3 1/2 year old son.There is plenty of good advice here about preparing for the actual CGC test and what to expect. If passing the CGC test is your goal, the easiest approach is to enroll yourself and your dog in a hands on obedience class and use this book as the companion text book you almost won't get otherwise.For those without ready access to obedience classes, this book does provide guidance on how to train your dog by yourself. Having been through several obedience classes with our dog, I believe that if you followed the Volhards' advice carefully - and actually practiced the skills as they suggest - you really could train your dog on your own using this book.I have set myself a challenge - to have our family dog (a 2 year old shelter rescue Australian Shepherd mix) take and pass the CGC test at the local dog show in about a month. As the local dog show is VERY large, this will be an extremely distracting environment and a real challenge for our dog. I am convinced that when our dog takes the test she will pass. This book has helped me understand how to get her ready and how to help her be pretty much the perfect family dog.In the year-and-a-half since the kids wore me down and convinced me we really \"needed\" a dog, I have bought several dog books and skimmed many more at bookstores and libraries. This is the one book I would enthusiastically recommend for any dog owner in the early stages of teaching good manners to their dog, even if they never plan on having their dog take the Canine Good Citizen test.Great stuff, and highly recommended.Update - our dog has now taken, and passed the Canine Good Citizen test. I am still convinced that the Volhard's book is great stuff. Their advice equipped me to teach our dog to be a well mannered member of the family. Following their advice, she aced the test.",

He has since passed to doggie heaven and two new dogs, Tempo and Scherazadh, also Great Danes, have taken their place in our hearts and home. It has been my wish to train one of them to be a therapy dog since I first saw the effect of a visit by such a dog to my ICU unit several years ago. Like the heroine dog, Lady, in the book this dog was very well trained, very friendly, and was an instant success. The patient had suffered a self-inflicted gun shot wound to the face and was VERY depressed, but the dog was able to connect in a way and to such a degree I had seldom seen in the past. I was very impressed. Unfortunately I have been unable to get my pets to the level of behavior that the dog I met or the dog Lady acheieved.The book shows the importance of early training for dogs, significant even for a family pet who doesn't go on to be a therapy dog, and of the involvement of the owner with the animal. One doesn't just with provid food and shelter, one must devote time to them as well. Sometimes people who want to owe a dog forget that they need more attention than a cat or a bird. They don't realize that a dog is a member of the family, and one that needs a lot of attention.The book also provides names, addresses and web sites of non-profit organizations that provide further information about therapy dogs for those individuals who would like to learn more about them or to learn about programs for training them. This is a significant addition, especially for the student who may like to write a report on training animals, on the jobs that working animals do, and on animals and people.The reading level of the book is that of about a 1st or 2nd grade level or for precocious younger readers, but it would also make a good \"read to me\" book for younger pre-readers.A very charming addition to any child's personal library or to a public or school library.",

This sage old dog, so unlike the traditional, overwrought animal narrator, provides a sense of detachment from events like the Wat Taylor rebellion that allows us to feel the peasant's righteousness as well as to cringe at their senseless mob violence. Above all, get ready to breath this one in. Fire, Bed &amp; Bone is so splendidly redolent with the real, visceral scents of the age that you will inhale it as much as you read it.",

This is set at the time of the 1381 Peasants' Revolt in England, and it shows the causes and events and results of that social upheaval in a way that is quite sympathetic to the peasants' side of the story without glossing over the mob violence that was involved. The book manages to be dense with factual information without being boring or preachy. However, the narrator is a dog -- a dog accustomed to a life of good care, with the comfort of the fire, a bed, and an occasional bone shared from the meager resources of its owners. And the dog tells us not only about the impact of social unrest on the people but also on their animals. The reading level is suitable for average fifth graders, but the issues are powerful and complex enough to interest older students of any reading level. This is a wonderful narrative of human events from an animal's perspective and should be placed along the classics of this genre.",

                "review/text": "In 1381, English folk rebelled against the oppressive system of serfdoms. Cruel lords and masters ruled villages of ordinary folk with no say over the heavy taxation and unjust laws.For a simple hunting dog, human politics meant little to nothing. As the canine friend to Rufus, a simple man, the old dog is happy to keep her place by the fire, take her master hunting, and sleep in the house.Everything changes shortly after the birth of her latest litter of puppies. Soldiers take Rufus and his wife, Comfort, away, leaving behind their three children. The dog ensures the children's safety and returns to find only one of her puppies has remained. Together, she and her young pup do their best to survive. She experiences freedom, captivity, and reunion, all in the names of love, loyalty, and survival.Originally published in 1998, FIRE, BED & BONE is a dog's observation of the horrors life sometimes presents us. This telling of a significant event in history is done in a way that will engage kids, teach them, and show them a wonderful story. Using a dog's point of view (there are no talking animals in this book) to portray the way of men is a powerful tool, and in this case, it is well used.This book should be a leading candidate for classroom use, as well as for simple reading enjoyment. The writing is easy to follow and sentimental without growing sappy. I definitely recommend this title.Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer10/26/2006",

        "description": "The national bestselling memoir of a friendship between a New England outdoorsman and the scrawny foxhound who came to his door one snowy day. In the midst of a blizzard, late one Christmas night in the 1950s, author Hal Borland heard a howl at the back door of his home on a hundred-acre farm in the Housatonic Valley of northwest Connecticut. Resistant at first, he called around trying to find an owner whose dog had gone missing-with no luck. Finally, with the encouragement of his wife and haunted by memories of his childhood collie, Borland brought some scraps of leftover steak outside. This was his introduction to Pat, a miserable, half-starved, but deeply trusting black-and-white foxhound mutt. Pat would soon become a member of the family, accompanying Borland on hunts and terrorizing the local woodchuck population-and teaching him that sometimes our most immediate connection to the natural world is through the animals we live with. A longtime journalist and a winner of the John Burroughs Medal for distinguished nature writing, Borland tells the tale of the time he shared with Pat in this touching true story that \"will appeal to many sportsmen and to all people who have ever been closely attached to a dog\" (The New York Times Book Review).",

        "description": "At the age of 36, Caroline Knapp, author of the acclaimed bestseller Drinking:A Love Story, found herself confronted with a monumental task: redefining her world. She had faced the loss of both her parents, given up a twenty-year relationship with alcohol, and, as she writes, \"I was wandering around in a haze of uncertainty, blinking up at the biggest questions: Who am I without parents and without alcohol? How to form attachments, and where to find comfort, in the face of such daunting vulnerability?\" An answer materialized in the most unlikely form: that of a dog. Eighteen months to the day after she quit drinking, Knapp stumbled upon an eight-week-old puppy at a local animal shelter, took her home, and named her Lucille. Now two years old, Lucille has become a central force in Knapp's life: \"In her,\" she writes, \"I have found solace, joy, a bridge to the world.\" Caroline Knapp has been celebrated as much for her fresh insight into emotional and psychological issues as she has been for her gifts as a writer. In Pack of Two, she brings the same perception and talent to bear on the rich, complicated terrain of human-animal relationships. In addition to mining her own experience with Lucille, Knapp speaks to a wide variety of dog people--from animal behaviorists and psychologists to other owners whose dogs have deeply affected their lives--about this emotionally complex, sometimes daunting, often profoundly healing alliance. Throughout, she explores the shift in canine roles from working partners to intimate companions and looks, too, at how this new kinship, this wordless bond, becomes a template for what we most desire ourselves.",

There is some pretty convoluted introspection, but she eventually comes out with a very life- and dog-affirming position--in the best cases, we love our dogs for themselves, not as replacements for kids, partners, etc. Well, no kidding. I think she approaches, but does not look straight at, the possibility that the affirmation we receive from our dogs makes us stronger--because we have dogs, we don't need people as much, and may be happier to be without partner or kids--although she makes the point that dog people tend to be more sociable and have more friends (often other dog people)... Alone (if you call hanging with the mutts alone) more, but less needy. Not a bad way to be.One footnote. Knapp unfortunately confuses operant conditioning/positive reinforcement with no training/no discipline. In fact, operant conditioning/positive reinforcement training requires a great deal of discipline--it's just the discipline doesn't take the form of strangling your dog, pinching his/her ears, etc. People who don't train their dogs are really irresponsible. People who believe you have to hurt your dog to train it are either misguided or sadistic. Jean Donaldson's &quot;The Culture Clash&quot; makes these points clearly and forcefully.",

However, I did love Caroline Knapp's last book, &quot;Drinking: A Love Story,&quot; and I eagerly awaited her next effort. I have to say I was a little disappointed. At 250 or so pages, this isn't a long book, but it feels like it should have been about 240 pages shorter. Knapp passes over the same territory again and again, often using the same images and descriptions. They're ones that seemed fresh to me in &quot;Drinking&quot; (there's never just rage, but &quot;oceans&quot; or &quot;rivers&quot; of it; &quot;add venom and stir,&quot; a great description of anger, has multiplied into at least 5 versions of the &quot;and stir&quot; or &quot;stew&quot; images) but now seem tired and unimaginative. These are stylistic concerns, though - my biggest problem with this book is that despite its attempts at characterizing its chapters with headings like &quot;Therapy Dog,&quot; in the end each section is more and more of the same. It reminded me a little of Stewart Smalley, the character from Saturday Night Live who repeated, &quot;I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and gosh darn it, people like me.&quot; Caroline loves her dog Lucille more than anything; Lucille loves her (she hopes.) And, gosh darn it, she's okay with that, so you should be, too.",

Her largely anecdotal work will both resonate with those who have a dog, and will help to shade in mysterious and perplexing areas for those who don't -- and who wonder how people can get so darn attached to an animal.And, perhaps best of all, Ms. Knapp avoids most of the preposterious dog-as-human-in-little-fur-coat anthromorphism that many writers of less talent and intelligence have used to convey that difficult to describe feeling of being engaged in a reciprocal love relationship with a dog.As a writer myself, I am impressed -- and a little bit jealous of -- Ms. Knapp's use of language and phrasing to convey both complicated concepts and strong emotions. And, there are quite a few instances of humor in the book as well -- any dog owner who, as Ms. Knapp recounts, is convinced that a neighbor overhearing him or her speak to the dog would think &quot;I'm a goon&quot; will certainly empathize.Again, the tone of this book is appropriate for both &quot;dog people&quot; and those indifferent to dogs alike. And, for those individuals (you all know who you are) who have fretted while dining out -- or, better yet, refused a dinner invitation altogether -- because of not wanting to leave Rover home alone, this book will speak to your soul.",

For some, dogs can and do provide a type of love found nowhere else. Even, as Ms. Knapp points out, if your life is balanced and full with a spouse, kids, career and other emotional connections. Perhaps one of the best things this book accomplishes is the confidence with which she says that loving a dog does not mean you are emotionally flawed. That alone should be merit enough.This book is so different from many other dog books. It is introspective, personal, affirming.

She gives the reader a greater appreciation, like a wine expert might teach someone more to appreciate about wine.Ms. Knapp loved dogs for their tolerance, faithfulness, lack of artificial baggage, and accepting accomodation. She found qualities in her dog that she did not perceive in the humans she encountered.She asserts that relationships with dogs are occasionally a substitute for other things; but more often, they are beautiful on their own merits and do not find value by being a substitute for something else.Dogs can't use words. They are beautiful because they must learn to listen and communicate to the people around them largely based on non-verbal cues.Very sadly, Ms. Knapp died at too young of an age.

Excellently written, Caroline Knapp succeeds in verbalizing the thoughts and feelings of dog owners who love their dogs as deeply as they do their dearest family members. She captures with words what many of us have felt and known in our hearts...anyone who has felt lost and alone and turned to his dog for comfort and love will understand what she means when she describes having a dog as &quot;solitude without loneliness.&quot; Anyone who has heard &quot;its just a dog&quot; and secretly thought, &quot;No, he's my dearest friend&quot; will see themselves in many places in this book. Those who feel a desire to get a dog but don't know why will likely find the answers in this book -- especially if they've felt deep personal pain. For those of us who love our dogs deeply, but come from families or cultures who consider this kind of love &quot;stupid&quot; or! ! &quot;abnormal,&quot; this book is a vindication, a testament that the way we feel is normal, that there are many others who feel as we do. If you fit any of these descriptions, I'm sure you'll find &quot;Pack of Two&quot; as insightful and moving as I have.

It comes at me in all forms, suddenly and with enormous impact, from making shifts in work to having and raising a kid to buying a cabin on a distant mountaintop. Sometimes, change comes on four legs.\" In his popular and widely praised Running to the Mountain, Jon Katz wrote of the strength and support he found in the massive forms of his two yellow Labrador retrievers, Julius and Stanley. When the Labs were six and seven, a breeder who'd read his book contacted Katz to say she had a dog that was meant for him-a two-year-old border collie named Devon, well bred but high-strung and homeless. Katz already had a full canine complement, but instinct overruled reason, and soon thereafter he brought Devon home. A Dog Year: Twelve Months, Four Dogs, and Me is the story of how Devon and Jon-and Julius and Stanley-came to terms with each other. It shows how a man discovered a lot about himself through one dog (and then another) whose temperament seemed as different from his own as day is from night. It is a story of trust and understanding, of life and death, of continuity and change. It is by turns insightful, hilarious, and deeply moving.",

After all, I am a border collie owner....an owner who adopted an abused border collie six years ago. To say that my life has changed for the better since then would be an understatement. Of course, these aren't feelings only reserved for owners of border collies as all of my friends who are dog owners feel the same way. There is a magic in having a dog in your life and I'm just happy to be so blessed.With that said, it caused me to read this book with my own dog in mind judging the author's own decisions along the way. I just couldn't reconcile the idyllic life he had with Julius and Stanley (his Labrador Retrievers) and then bringing Devon (his adopted Border Collie) into the fray knowing full well that it would overturn the applecart. Once Devon arrived, I felt like Julius and Stanley were pushed to the side and relegated to the backyard, while Devon occupied all of their owner's time. Was this their reward for years and years of loyalty and companionship? Yes, it was great for the new addition to the family but at the expense of two dogs the author supposedly loved above all things.As if that wasn't bad enough, Stanley begins to get sick...not sick enough that he wasn't enjoying life any longer. I read the section, where Jon takes all three dogs to the mountains so that Stanley could enjoy his last trip there, with a knot in my stomach knowing full well that, upon their return, he was going to have Stanley put to sleep. There's no way I could spend a glorious weekend romping in the woods with my dog, having him retrieve the ball he so loved knowing that his days were numbered because of a decision I was making.Perhaps I'm being too critical but these two things took away from the overall enjoyment this book could have given me. In no way could I look my beloved border collie in her one blue and one brown eye and tell her not only that I was bringing someone else into our home who would change her life forever (and not for the better) and, as if that's not bad enough, there's no way I could drive her to the vet and put her down when she wasn't even close to no longer being a functional and loving pet.

I heard Jon Katz on NPR discuss his newest book, and knew I had to read his work. I decided to start with an older book of his to get the flavor of the writing and his message. This is a \"cannot put down\" book. A book filled with humour and fun and sadness and death.Jon Katz believes strongly that if we are to take a dog into our lives, we must treat them as dogs, not as humans. Dogs do not know human behavior, and we should not treat them as such. And, if we love our dogs we will have them trained by someone legitimate, someone who understands dogs. Dogs need to learn to live in our people society.Jon Katz had two lovely Labrador dogs, Julius and Stanley. Everyone loved them. They were the kind of dogs who are peaceful and contained. They loved everyone and actually liked to lick children's faces. They went everywhere with Jon and were well behaved. So, then, why did Jon feel an urge to bring into their lives a border collie who was untrained, wild and had not succeeded in his previous environment? You will come to understand. Jon was approached by a trainer who had read his books on dogs to take in this animal. Devon arrived from Texas on a wild and wooly night via airplane at a New Jersey airport. Jon waited for him and when his cage appeared, he unclasped the lock and zoom the dog was gone. Jon and the security guards spent the next 45mins trying to capture Devon. Finally, he was corralled and thus started the trial to tame Devon. Devon was a border collie, intelligent and curious, but he was the master and no one had been able to train him successfully. He needed to herd and he would run into the road trying to herd garbage trucks and buses. This just didn't work, He would run away and just at the time Jon started thinking it might be time to send Devon back to Texas- a miracle occurred.Julius and Stanley were not loving Devon's arrival, but they tolerated him. Jon and the three dogs would go to an isolated area in New York State on a small farm and run free. Finally life seemed less stressful, and then the unexpected. One of the dogs becomes ill, and one of the most moving dog experiences I have ever read occurs. Tears dripping down my face I finished that chapter. And, then on to the arrival of Homer another border collie.The lessons learned from this book about loving and living with dogs are significant. This is one of those books that help us to realize why animals are so important to our lives. So well written that I feel I know Jon Katz and I certainly know Julius, Stanley, Devon and Homer. Unabashedly recommended. prisrob",

The set up: Sedate middle age man gets feisty intelligent border collie because a breeder who read his book thought they were a good match (?). One internet search on border collies would provide enough information to tell him this breed was not a good fit. Border collies are intelligent and sensitive and need to be throughly trained. This usually require (demand) more time and effort than other breeds.In the book we meet Devon when he gets loose in the crowded airport (Katz's fault). He boosted that the dog was a \"champion border collie\" to discourage an officer from calling in animal control. Although he had no experience with Devon, he was less concerned that a frightened dog would bite when cornered than passing up the chance to let strangers know he had a \"special\" dog. Katz's treatment of Devon is disturbing (yelling, throwing chains, hitting) as is his lack of judgement in letting Devon chase trucks. Regardless of the fact a barrier was in place, he was setting a dangerous precedent.What's frustrating is that Katz had the money to pay professionals who would have trained both him and the dogs but didn't bother asking for help. Maybe having a dog that was miserable because it didn't know how it was expected to behave was more entertaining.Katz should have stuck with labs. Less interesting book material but a better fit for his personality/lifestyle. He is making money from the misery his own dog ownership is imposing. Consider that purchasing his books will encourage him to spread tales of his poor actions and decisions.",

                "review/text": "Do not make the mistake of thinking this book is a training guide or how-to book for dog owners. Mr. Katz is, by nature, a story teller, and in this compact book, he weaves together observations and anecdotes during the course of a dog year, a year he pretty much devoted to his four dogs, a pair of aging labs and a pair of young border collies.The striking differences in the dispositions of the labs and Devon, a troubled border collie he adopts sight unseen constitute much of the book's premise. Mr. Katz must come to terms with Devon, a dog that is totally different from his beloved, mellow labs---so different, that he soon earns the nickname \"Helldog.\" In learning to train and love this high-strung, very intelligent new addition, he must confront his own notions of discipline, commitment, and duty. He does not always make the right decisions, but he willing lays out the consequences, right or wrong, for readers.Though there may be lessons here for dog owners, and especially for potential dog owners, the book ultimately is a musing, and a good one, on looking honestly on life and death, seeing into one's own dark corners, and rejoicing on the primal bond between human and canine.If nothing else, I would hope that Katz opens up some eyes about how much work and joy are intertwined in being a dutiful dog owner.",

I do, however, try to give everyone a fair shake.However, there were some things in this book -- which is full of hypocrisy, BTW -- that turned my blood cold. His inclusion in puppy testing of checking for pain sensitivity (he calls it touch sensitivity), because your training program will assume the dog will respond to pain, is chilling. And the statement \"Experience says that force is an inescapable training element\" shows that, no matter how open-minded he says he is in the preface, this trainer has not explored all options. He views \"tough\" dogs and \"submissive\" dogs as irredeemable, while other training programs not based in force have turned these dogs into wonderful companions.Although at no time does the author suggest that he is not a force-based trainer, he states repeatedly in the front matter that he gives a dog a chance to learn before applying force; yet from lesson one he recommends giving a new verbal command to a dog and applying pressure with a pinch collar to force a dog into various as-yet unlearned positions.I was hoping to find in this book something more based in relationship-building than the traditional correction-based methodology, something I could recommend to those who cling to force-based methods. Yet the only place where I could agree with this author is that a pinch collar is less damaging than a choke chain (which, frankly, has no place on any dog). It was a disappointment.Better reading materials for those who don't want to use strictly food-based training methods include \"Excel-erated Learning\" (Pamela Reid), \"So Your Dog's Not Lassie,\" and \"Never Say No\"(Dr. Mugford).",

                "review/text": "McMains is a dog lover, first and foremost. He takes great pains to emphasize that dogs are friends and comrades, not employees or slaves, and should be treated with the respect and love they deserve. In the heat of training, many people (even many trainers) seem to forget that the reason they originally got a dog was not to do a straight sit or a snappy recall, but rather to fill out their world with a new friend. I don't know a friend in existence who would tolerate what some trainers advocate in the name of &quot;training.&quot;His method is not compulsion-free, but it is centered around the dog VOLUNTEERING behaviors, rather that being yanked/forced into them repeatedly. He discusses how to use the dog's natural compulsions/drives to encourage the behaviors the team is shooting for, as well as ways of solidifying those responses under REALISTIC distraction conditions.The most telling point about the book's organization is that it doesn't adhere slavishly to the standard AKC Novice routines, but rather focuses on skills and attitudes that the non-competitor will find most necessary/useful around the home, which is where all dogs, competitor or not, spend most of their time. Make no mistake, a McMains-trained dog will reach its full competitive potential, but McMains' focus is where it should be, on the 99.9% of the dog's life spent outside the ring.In a world where millions of dogs are put to sleep in shelters each year, primarily for &quot;temperament problems&quot; (which can be interpreted as the owner crying &quot;I don't know how to deal with this dog!&quot;), a book with this much compassion and intelligent information on how to understand and relate to your own dog is invaluable. The problem is not that there are too many dogs in this country, it's that there are too many OUT OF CONTROL dogs in this country.If McMains has his way, that won't be the case forever.",

                "review/text": "&quot;Dog Logic&quot; was a brilliant piece of work, penned by a master dog handler in hopes of bettering the lot of his canine buddies. Far too many people own dogs who shouldn't, either due to ignorance, laziness, or just plain nastiness. Mister McMains realizes this, and knows that the answer to the problem can be summed up in a single word: RAPPORT. If you objectify an animal, as (unfortunately) does the overwhelming majority of dog trainers, you may be able to get your dog to perform tricks and obey commands, but that deeper connection will not be present. If, like most owners, you simply think of your dog(s) as nothing more than a &quot;pet for the kids,&quot; &quot;something to bark at a doorknob rattler,&quot; or even &quot;a creature that lives to eat, shed, and mess,&quot; then your dog is far more likely to be ignored and otherwise neglected than if he were instead viewed as a member of your family entitled to your respect. Contrary to what pseudo-intellectuals like Desmond Morris would have us believe, dogs ARE capable of higher thought processes, and DO express actual emotions. Neglect is psychological abuse, and will have negative effects on your animal's personality. As the U.S.A.F. K-9 school says, &quot;Every handler will end up with the dog he deserves.&quot; The &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; after the Postscript is well worth the cost of this book in itself.

Joel is one of the few authors I've read who seems to really UNDERSTAND dogs and the dog/human relationship as it should be--not as politics or fads would have them be...a must read for the first timer, as well as those of us with years of dog experience. I would also recommend &quot;Manstopper&quot; for a genuine insight into how dogs learn by association. Even if you have no desire or interest in protection training, it will prove invaluable for problem solving (and prevention) in your basic obedience training at home....it teaches you how to think associatively like a dog does. Dog Logic is not a book for the wishy-washy or those of us who don't have time to invest in a regular training routine...it's for people who are serious about having a well mannered dog and want to train in such a way as to INCREASE the trust and love between you and your pet.

I, too, have a husband who survived a traumatic brain injury (stroke), and the man I married did not fully survive either.Thomas's writing is poetic, courageous, and raw. Her story is the pain and joy of the human condition distilled in a small volume. Thomas weaves a new cloth of love from what was and what is now, looking for the meaning of life in the simple and the mundane, and appreciating both with keen insight. Abigail Thomas, the woman, discovers hard and wonderful truths about herself, and is wise enough to learn from her husband the infinite value of just one moment of life, lived in the present. As a writer, she shares generously with us the wisdom she has aquired, but did not ask for.Although this book looks at tragedy head-on, it is filled with beauty and humor. I laughed out loud, as well as cried while reading it.

Rich was not able to live at home and Abigail moved upstate to be near the facility where he lived, bringing him home for a visit every week. She filled her days with writing, knitting, and napping with her three dogs.While the facts of the story are painfully sad, Abigail infuses her writing with loving accommodations of Rich's diminished condition. Of her visits, so often made difficult by his inability to fix himself in the real world: \"During the days when it is impossible to communicate in words, I get into his bed and we hold hands. Nap therapy. This is a familiar posture, something we can do without speech, without thinking.\" Rich's reality becomes her reality on the days when she can't penetrate his confused world.Abigail's enjoyment of her dogs is threaded through the book. Like her husband, they force her to live in the present. \"Dogs are never in a bad mood over something you said at breakfast,\" she writes. \"Dogs never sniff at the husks of old conversations, or conduct autopsies on weekends gone wrong. An unexamined life may not be worth living, but the overexamined life is hell. We talk too much.\"Although \"A Three Dog Life\" is labeled a memoir, it's not laid out in the linear fashion of most memoirs -- more like a collection of essays presented in random order. For me this presentation left a lack of closure with several of her themes. I realize that it was a deliberate choice by the author but for me it was the one blemish on an otherwise magical reading experience. Do read it for yourself, in one sitting if you can.

It turned out that he was a Min Pin, a very abused one. The obvious previous mistreatment of this dog and his, resulting, very aggressive and fearful behavior made me question weather or not we could help him. Then, that evening I found myself sitting quietly on the couch, reading this wonderful book and suddenly I was joined by our \"found dog\". He cautiously curled up on my lap (our first positive interaction!) and I (carefully at first) pet him and read, all evening. By the end of the book, we had bonded. It wasn't an easy journey, but we made it. It has been four years and he is one of the smartest, funniest, most loving dogs we have ever known. We can't imagine our life without him.This is a teriffic book for anyone who has adopted a rescued dog (or is thinking about it). It gives wonderful inspiration!",

I literally get nightmares when I read about animals who are suffering and I wasn't sure if this book would be more upsetting then pleasurable since I knew many of the dogs would have tragic tales before adoption. My experience with this book: got it today, sat down on the sofa with it and simply could not put it down. I read every story and even though many of them were tragic they really didn't dwell on the horrific past in a way that made me uncomfortable. I did cry but they were slow, blissful tears that often melted into the edges of an unforseen smile. These stories are some of the most uplifting, gorgeous stories I have ever read and the photos that accompany them are beautiful, often spontaneous portraits of owners embracing their saved animals. In every furry face you can see the joy and the gratitude and the extinguished pain. They are saved and they are home and it burns your eyes and warms your heart and leaves you shivering in goose pimples. I am SO glad I decided to order this book!

                "review/text": "\"Found Dogs\" recounts numerous success stories of dogs winding up with new, caring owners after being strays, rescued, or otherwise finding a suitable human. The editor Elise Lufkin and photographer Diana Walker document these success stories with pithy narratives that capture the human perspective and revealing black and white photos that say more about the dogs than the people. Taken together, the text and images reveal convey the strength of the bond between humans and dogs and vice versa.The book runs the gamut from small to large, pure bred to mutt dogs, and, likewise, captures a good portion of the human spectrum from blue collar workers to celebrities, from young to old, and from those already savvy about canines to neophyte owners.A trend that recurs in many of the tales is that bringing a new dog home requires work, patience, and understanding (those same qualities these dogs' previous humans lacked). The author provides a number of resources in the appendices for those who want to rescue or adopt a dog or learn more about training and recreation.Certainly, Ms. Lufkin and Ms. Walker are preaching to the choir in a sense, but one hopes that anyone thinking of adding a dog to his or her family will perhaps check out a book like this one first to obtain a better sense of the rewards and effort that are the inherent, intertwined realities of responsible dog ownership.",

The secret of her ebullient and innovative guide to training: dogs are individuals, and any dog's nature depends far less on his breed or pedigree than most training methods suppose. In easy steps, you can quickly determine your dog's \"personality\"-the interplay of prime motivations, energy level, work ethic, and emotional profile-to tailor a regimen optimally suited to his learning needs. Where \"one-size\" programs typically founder in canine chaos and human frustration, the Santo method carries you past failure: even when your dog doesn't respond, your understanding of him deepens and leads you to a better strategy. This unique interactive approach-based on the author's twenty years of experience-not only speeds canine learning but also lifts training from a temporary chore to an increasingly relaxed way of life. The result is a lifetime of improving obedience-an ever more confident and happy dog, and an ever more gratifying relationship for you both.",

An elderly couple is obsessed with the something that they've never done--the experience of parenting. The book kindly provides for them through the introduction of a lonely drifter character. What forms is the most gruesome parody of human relationships ever depicted. The drifter has nothing and, as such, is willing to accept nearly anything. The psychological makeup of the drifter suggests that he's either exceptionally mentally handicapped or that he's been treated most horribly throughout his life. He is undemanding, unassuming, and has almost no will. The elderly couple, whose lives have been more normal, have no idea how to reach the man and no way to help him open his eyes to the enjoyment of life. The psychological tension combined with the sheer hopelessness of the situation makes the novel a very depressing read.It could be summed up metaphorically: Severely mistreated sled-dog that has been used in vicious dogfighting finally escapes and, after traveling hundreds of miles in despair and loneliness, finds a macabre solace in a herd of milk cows. The dog eventually snaps from psychological tension, deprivation of productive attention, and constantly dodging the lumbering behemoths who rarely bother to look for the dog underfoot. The cows are forced to trample the dog to keep him from nipping at their ankles when they step on his tail.",

The story is enthralling, yet educates as it entertains. I cannot adequately stress this! I've read this work at least a half dozen times over the past three decades, and I still come away with yet another pearl of wisdom into what makes us do the things we do. Characters do not get more true to life than Alice and Albert Graves...I gained such an empathy for the elderly, and the quiet desperation in which they live out the remainder of their lives. The mean-spiritedness which bubbles along just under the surface of small town America...how small a catalyst it indeed takes to bring out the worst in people!

Harry Buck drove a company car -a \"salesman's coupe\" with large trunk and platform replacing the rear seat, plus heavy-duty springs for the extra weight of his tool kits, over the state of Missouri and northern Arkansas from Monday through Friday. He was often called out on weekends, during which times, I would occasionally accompany him.When he was in the Marshall, Missouri area, Gramp stayed at the old Ruff Hotel, owned and run by the Van Arsdales. My grand-dad never met Jim (the dog died in 1937), but he did talk to Sam Van Arsdale about his remarkable dog and brought back Clarence Mitchell's book for me. My grand-dad also met townspeople who verified the accounts told about Jim. I was fascinated by the book and remember it vividly, more than a half-century after reading it. The one shortcoming I found with the book is the fact that it was written in the first-person, making it seem more like a Jack London tale than the thoroughly documented account of a supernatural fact that eludes our ability to explain, to this day.

Jim displayed signs of extremely high intelligence.* Jim was able to pick out colors a person was wearing, although dogs are apparently color-blind.* He could pick out a car by its owner, color, make, or license plate number.* He could pick out a variety of trees or shrubs, name of a business, or the occupation or home of a stranger.* As Jim could not speak, a variety of answers were written on slips of paper even in different languages and Jim would always pick out the correct one.On top of this- the Story is written from the Dog's eye view- super cute.I would safely recommend it for all ages to read",

In the central grey section he tells, step-by-step, how to train a particular behaviour (e.g., &quot;Sit,&quot; &quot;Stay,&quot; etc.), what to expect as your dog begins to learn, and how to address specific problems as they arise in the training process. He doesn't expect one to read his mind when he describes a process--he gives one all the necessary information, including photographs, so one will know if one is going about something the right way.The only potential drawback to this book is that he does incorporate a traditional dog training collar in some exercises. I contend, however, that if one has firmly followed his instructions on how to engage a dog--in language the dog understands--one will find that the dog performs such that corrections are not necessary. This is especially true if you begin work with a puppy (a dog under the age of two).If all humans engaged their new pups in *Dog Talk* from the day they brought them home, the dog shelters/dog pounds would no longer be over-flowing with discarded pets, and there would be virtually no such thing as a &quot;bad&quot; dog anymore.This book really is just that good.",

                "review/text": "Dog training has recently gone through a metamorphosis, churning out a whole new slew of &quot;positive only&quot; training methods. Clickers and food are the new tools of the trade. Well, let me tell you - don't go for this &quot;ersatz&quot; training. You will only be in for frustration - both for you and your dog. Train your dog properly - in a way that is both easy and that your dog understands - without the use of gimmicks like treats and noisy toys. _Dog Talk_(and John Ross's book on puppy training)are the way to get there.He teaches you how to train a pet dog for real life. The &quot;down-stay&quot; is focused on immediately in his step-by-step training program, as he understands how this simple command can make or break your relationship with your dog. You teach all the commands in steps that introduce the dog to what you want without harsh corrections.You mold the dog into position, instead of correcting upwards sharply for a sit, gently place the dog in a down - no dragging with the collar. When your dog begins to understand, you up the criteria until your dog understands fully enough to &quot;test&quot; her. You place the leash and training collar on and give the command. Due to the work you have put into teaching the meaning of the word, you dog will almost certainly do as you ask. If not, a gentle correction is used to guide the dog into the proper position. If you had to use a correction, you go back and work on understanding with your dog. This is a completely comprehensive and fair way of training a dog.The author also teaches you how to solve all sorts of behavioral &quot;problems&quot; like food stealing, leash pulling, and jumping up in a fair and comprehensible manner that the dog understands very well. You correct using your dogs own natural corrections - a scruff shake, a harsh &quot;Naaah&quot; growl, a nip on the snout. This is what a dog understands. A dog doesn't understand that if it stops eating the cake on the table it will get a click and treat - it understands that if you don't stop her, she gets to eat cake, and that eating the cake is perfectly acceptable. If you growl &quot;naaaahhh&quot; as your dog is thinking about jumping up to eat the cake, you dog thinks &quot;uh oh, that behavior is not something that Pack Leader will allow&quot; and leaves the cake. Possibly she will try again, and you(pack leader) would follow up with a harsher &quot;naaaah&quot; and possibly a scruff shake. Again, and a nip on the muzzle.This is what a dog understands - the growl warns the dog that repercussions will ensue if she continues on that path. She understands that if she continues, she will be corrected. A dog learns this while with their mother. Its the natural way to train your dog - using your dog's own language. This is what you learn using Dog Talk.I have had many dogs. This book has helped me teach them each how to be exemplary companions in every way. We can go to baseball games - my dog will lie down and stay, her leash in her mouth. We can walk down busy streets - depending on local laws, she can wear her leash, or she can walk beside me carrying it in her mouth. She listens when I speak, and is continuing her education so that she can compete in obedience trials.When I first got her, she was overweight, aggressive, had separation anxiety, more energy than should be possible in a single dog, and the ability to pull me off my feet on walks. Now she is one of the best dogs I have ever had, because I learned to talk to her in her own language.",

I followed it religiously and it worked like a dream. As a result, both my dogs are amazingly well trained and behaved. By the time they were six months old they both responded to spoken commands as well as hand signals. I can leave food out on the table without fear they will eat it when I'm not in the room, leave them in a down stay for as long as I need and take them for walks without being dragged. They even go pee on command! Neither one of them took or needed obedience training.Fair warning though, it does require time and effort. It isn't enough to try it once and give up if it doesn't work right away. If that is your approach then you should probably look for professional help.Also, while the book gives you excellent ideas and methods, it is not a cookbook. You can't simply follow the instructions exactly and expect it to work perfectly for every dog.Dogs all have their own personality and likes and dislikes. While one of my dogs will do rolls until the cows come home, the other hates doing even one. The book requires creativity and sensitivity on the part of the owner. If you don't have those qualities, it's probably best to find a pro who does.I've loaned this book to a dozen people since I got it. Just about every one of them loved it and used it to either train their dog or rid their dog of a bad habit. If you are the type of person who likes working with your dog and wants to teach him to do more than just 'sit', this is the book for you!",

John Ross's book really boils down the basics to brass tacks, and makes it easier for the layperson to understand. I don't use a text for my classes, but if I did, this would be it.The thing I like best about this book is John's balanced approach. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to learn that dogs, since they can't learn our language, need for us to communicate in ways that are meaningful to them. Balanced training is just better communication, period. Dogs understand it, so they learn faster. The &quot;positive only&quot; folks out there want you to think all corrections are going to ruin your relationship with your dog, but that is simply not so. Humane, effective corrections are a part of teaching dogs, and if you train the right way, you don't need them very often. Ross explains how to train the right way, with praise, rewards, and yes, corrections if needed. He's not afraid to tell it like it is. I find this refreshing, and I know--it works.I do agree that there is no substitute for a good training class, including this book. Use them together (you do have to do your homework) and you will end up with a really well-behaved dog. Since training never ends, the book will give you something to refer back to to keep Fido in excellent form long after the class is over.You owe it to your dog to communicate with him in a language he understands. &quot;Dog Talk&quot; will show you how.",

                "review/text": "This is a simple little book. It's cheap and doesn't look like much, but the content can revolutionize your communication with your dog. It's about dog language, but not about the &quot;big&quot; wolf postures of dominance or submission that many of us already know about. This book is about the wide range of subtle signals (about 28, I think) that dogs use to communicate &quot;please calm down&quot; towards other dogs - or their owners. Because owners stress their dogs a lot, unintentionally. Like when we practice obedience exercises. In the middle of training, the dog starts looking away, yawning or sniffing the grass! Bored? Stubborn? Dominant? No, it's probably sending you signals to ask you to calm down!I attended a weekend seminar with Turid Rugaas last year which opened my eyes and I know that this works. Since then, and also since looking at video recordings from dog meetings, I now understand that dogs &quot;talk&quot; all the time. When meeting us or another dog, every single move or glance can carry a meaning. The other dog understands, if he has been allowed to &quot;practice&quot; dog language in lots of meetings with other dogs, but we, the humans, the supposed alphas, don't understand. Instead we try to teach the dog OUR verbal language. How frustrating for the dog! Shouldn't we first learn the dog's language?This is a book that makes you understand that dog language is so much more than where the tail or the ears are. It's about signals that our own pets send to us daily. With this book we can start looking at our own dog and see much, much more than we saw before. We will actually start to understand what our dog tells us. And, even more thrilling, we can use the dog's language ourselves and be understood by the dog! We can use the same calming signals to help the dog for example in a stressful situation.There is a cultural diffence between the European look on dog training and the American look. In America there is much focus on teaching a dog through reinforcing behaviors, like operant conditioning. Clicker training is very good, and I'm all for it. But when &quot;Culture Clash&quot; by Jean Donaldson came, it was considered to be a revolution, because some Americans had actually forgotten that dogs are dogs, with dogs' needs and drives and motivations!In Europe, we've always been interested in dog behavior. Konrad Lorenz is a good example. Swedish &quot;dog psychologist&quot; Anders Hallgren wrote about a dog's calming signals more than ten years ago, inspired by Ms Rugaas. Unfortunately his books are not spred in the US. Turid is Norwegian and also represents the European way: to look at the dog as a dog and try to understand how it thinks and feels and acts in a pack. So therefore I think that this is a very good book for every single dog owner, but especially (no offense) for American clicker-trainers. This book will make them even better trainers, because it will probably give them an important missing piece in the training puzzle.I think I can make a promise: If you read this book and use it, you'll never be able to look at a dog again the way you did before. It's a simple little book, but, at best, it's breath-taking!",

Now I don't mean she stops for a few seconds and sniffs at a bush or rock; she stops and refuses to move forward at all while she continues to sniff at an empty spot on the ground, all the while looking up at me. I would tug and pull on her leash, becoming more and more upset. Not realizing that when we had started the walk I was already tense and stressed, that I was hurrying and not paying attention to anything around me because I was concentrating on something disturbing. All this time she was telling me to calm down. Once I learned what she was saying, I forced myself to stop for a moment and take a few deep breaths and relax. Good for me, good for her and a much more enjoyable walk.Thank you Turid.",

If you have a problem dog, or just want to understand why dogs do what they do, this book is for you. This book will make for more happy owners and dogs. It is a great book for those of you who dont like to or simply dont have the time to read a lot. It is a to-the-point, no-nonsense and easy to read introduction to canine communication that explains dog behavior and interpreting dog communication signals in an easy to understand way. This a a short but very enlightening volume, filled with a ton of great information. A bit off-beat and quirky at times, it is a wonderful resource no dog owners library should be without. And the affordable price makes it even more worth while! I will continue to buy it as a gift for my dog-training friends and students.",

                "review/text": "Turid Rugaas' book is basically a simple book on one facet of canine body language.Most dog owners are aware of the concept of dominance: how dogs use growls, stares and other forms of ritualised aggression to raise their position in the pack hierachy. This is the other side of the coin: the language that dogs use to keep the peace in the pack and avoid conflict. Although Turid calls these postures \"calming signals\", most of us would probably call them signs of submission.Although the information in this book is interesting, I found the book unrealistically simplistic. Obviously, communicating with your dog in a format he can understand is immensely valuable for trainers and owners alike. However, Turid seems to think that any problem can be cured by using calming signals. There are numerous anecdotes in the book where dogs with behavioural problems are cured in a few minutes by the proper application of calming signals. Turid does not not discuss any cases where calming signals alone were insufficient to cure a dog's behavioural problems. I admit that calming signals are useful in many circumstances, but unfortunately they are not a magic cure for every dog's problems.I was also mildly annoyed that Turid discourages readers from ever using non-submissive body language with their dogs, no matter the circumstance: in her own words \"You have always a choice of being threatening or calming. To me the choice is easy.\" She seems to feel that using canine signals to convey anything except \"calming\" is tantamount to dog abuse. However, dominance and threat are just as much a part of canine body language as \"calming signals\" are. Why should we not occasionally use these as well, when they are appropriate? I might avert my gaze to calm a stressed dog, but if a dog is knowingly overstepping his bounds in the home a more appropriate reaction might be a hard stare. I recommend the Suzanne Clothier article \"Learning from the masters\" to anyone who would like to learn more about different uses of canine body language(http://www.flyingdogpress.com/pposa.html).Would I recommend this book? Yes. It is a good primer on one facet of canine body language, and most dog owners could probably benefit from a read of it. However, please keep in mind that calming signals are not the cure for every problem your dog might have!",

                "review/text": "If you and your dog have never taken an obedience class, this book could be a basic tool for beginning to understand your dog's behavior. But I do mean a &quot;basic&quot; tool. If you have, however, gone through any type of obedience or behavioral training with your dog, this book might not be a good use of your time and money. The information it provides is rudimentary at best. That is not to say that it isn't interesting, nor that it might not help some people. Just be aware that it probably won't be a magical solution to your dog's behavior problem. Turid Rugaas gives few hard and fast answers. Many of her solutions rely upon using her own good-natured and well-behaved dog to help calm a problem dog. Since Ms. Rugaas' dog isn't available to the rest of us, not much help can be found from that quarter.Considering that &quot;On Talking Terms with Dogs&quot; is more of a booklet than a book, having only 20-odd numbered pages and a few more unnumbered introductory ones, the price is fairly steep. A good obedience class will cost you a little more, but you and your dog will get far more out of it in the long run.",

                "review/text": "During my five, post-retirement years as a shelter volunteer, I've accumulated over six shelf-feet of dog books, most relating to behavior and training. Many were skimmed and forgotten; others required several readings to achieve maximum effect; some I kept only as examples of what I have come to consider bad practice.In contrast, OTTWD produced an immediate &quot;Ah ha!&quot; reaction, and I reread it occasionally as much to renew the sense of inspiration as to glean more information from its scant pages. (As other reviewers have pointed out, there are other, far more exhaustive treatments of the vocabulary of dogs -- such as those by Roger Abrantes and Stanley Coren.)I had barely finished reading the author's first, rather sketchy, case-study (which describes the role of her dog, Vesla, in communicating with the client's dog -- a recurring theme throughout) when I started to think about a pair of Border Collie mixes, Amelia and Cinder, at our shelter.They are as close to feral as any dogs I've ever been around. We suspect they grew up from puppies as junkyard dogs. Among the dozens of our all-volunteer staff who have tried to befriend them, only three of the most empathetic, female volunteers have progressed to the point where they can leash them for a walk. Amelia and Cinder always responded to me by barking and retreating, even though I already knew to avoid assertive body posture, eye contact, use of my deep, male voice, etc. I eventually quit trying to connect with them.The possibility that Ms. Rugaas opened for me was to use another dog as an intermediary. I decided to enlist the services of Mercedes, a young, high-strung, female Pit Bull that I was already teaching basic obedience. She will do anything she can understand to earn a quarter-inch cube of doggie salami.After Mercedes had learned the &quot;down&quot; command, both by hand signal and verbally, we began practicing it closer and closer to Amelia and Cinder's run. At first they barked constantly whenever Mercedes and I were within sight. However, after daily repetitions over a few weeks, &quot;the girls&quot;, as I call them, would stop barking and posturing within a second after Mercedes would lie down. After a few minutes of calm, sometimes the girls too would lie down -- often at a closer distance to me than they had ever approached when I was alone. I rewarded their calm by flipping tiny treats into their run.Within a few weeks I was able to approach the girls without Mercedes, enter their run and feed them by hand. Although they still approach me with great caution, I am now able to touch each of them around the muzzle.I don't know where my efforts will lead. I do know that what little progress I have made would not have been possible, were it not for the breakthrough I achieved with help from Mercedes -- and Turid Rugaas.",

This book comes highly recommended by our group. I am in the middle of reading it and applying its teachings to the training of our dog; I can't believe the difference in my relationship with him. It takes time and consistency to make it effective...patience too, but it is oh so worth it!A couple of things that I have learned are:1) If you think that your dog has messed up, look at yourself...99% of the time it's the trainer who has messed up.2) It is usually the trainer who has hindered the dog in speaking and understanding &quot;dogese&quot;, that is &quot;calming signals&quot;, and therefore it is the trainer who has to learn and &quot;re-teach&quot; this language to the dog. Calming Signals is just the book to teach this.During our search and rescue training, my dog used to get so wound up just before he searched a pile of rubble for a &quot;victim&quot; that he didn't work well. Calming Signals has helped me to effectively calm my dog down by using HIS language, and not mine. When I was stern with him, he would only get more wound up. Now, we sit down on the ground, I don't look him directly in the eyes, and yes, I even yawn at him. It works!Dog training is an investment of time (and lots of it). Dogese IS a foreign language for humans, and if our dogs are important to us, it is our responsibility to learn their language! Don't expect to give your dog a few signals here and there and have everything magically fall into place. You and your dog are learning to &quot;communicate&quot; with each other and Calming Signals is the &quot;phrase book&quot; to this language.I very much appreciate the insights from Gunilla Melkersson's review of Calming Signals and especially the cultural difference in American and European dog training. It is absolutely true!",

Try to predict what the dogs will do next by looking at their body language, and use of Calming Signals.Calming signals work. I look for them and use them myself when evaluating dogs for training, & when doing Delta Society Evaluations. I use them when working with aggressive dogs. The reason I am writing this today, is because I came to Amazon to order more copies of the book. One to keep for myself, one to lend to others.

As a Dachshund rescuer I have encountered dogs from terrible situations. The worst was Willie, a small, gorgious chocolate and tan, long haired Doxie. He had been a stud dog in a puppy mill with the only human interaction being of a negative nature.A fear biter, Willie was very difficult to handle when he came to our home. Unable to touch him we literally had to hurd him into the house and out of the house to potty. The only life he had known was in a cage and life in a house with humans was an extreme shock to him.Desperate to help Willie I ordered several books in search of information which would enable me to break through the wall of fear surrounding him. By using the body language outlined by Turid Rugaas, which Willie understood, I was able to put him at ease and touch him for the very first time. Honestly the boy seemed so surprized that I knew his language.Four months later we were able to place Willie with a special family who understood how far he had come from his puppy mill days. No longer frightened, he knew the kindness of and the love to be found in a dog loving home. He was and is a dog who owes his life to Turid Rugaas.",

        "description": "Far too often, we humans expect our dogs to understand what we say to them. Though we may spend a lot of time talking to them, we're really not communicating. And without proper communication, it's impossible to train a dog properly-- let alone make your human/canine relationship a rewarding one. Packed with unique insights and gentle training advice, The Rosetta Bone provides average dog owners with the know-how they need to decipher canine meanings, communicate effectively, increase training success, and share a deeper bond. Focusing on the behavioral basis-- the \"silent\" symbols-- for learning, understanding, and communicating, expert dog trainer and competitor Cheryl S. Smith reveals how you can use your own body language to send a message and even teach a dog what specific words mean. She reveals how a dog's breed can affect his personality and explains how to decode-- and correct-- common behavior problems. With the knowledge and solutions this book provides, you will train more effectively, enjoy your dog more, and ease your own stress. What's more, you'll apply what you've learned immediately, with solid, practical advice on: * Learning the As, Bs, Cs, and Ds of human-canine communication * Teaching English to your dog-- and, in turn, understanding \"Doglish\" * Using body language to assist in communication and help your dog learn * Incorporating various kinds of touch to tighten your bond * Making rewards and reprimands real, relevant, and reliable * Understanding the relationship between kids and dogs Supplemented with enlightening, easy-to-do exercises with your dog, as well as quotes from trainers, behaviorists, veterinarians, and humane society workers, The Rosetta Bone is a revealing guide to making life better in your human/canine household.",

This book is a must read for the person acquiring their first dog, experiencing behavior problems with a current animal, or wanting to communicate with their dog on a deeper level.

It also taught me quite a few things by clarifying the subtle differences between several canine messages, by explaining the different behaviors of certain breeds of dogs, and by clearing up the issues of common misinformation.This is a beautifully structured book. I was comfortable enough to read straight through it in two sittings. The sidebar exercises were fun and informative. The gentle training methods used in this book work with the dog's natural behaviors, easing stress on both species. Not to be forgotten, the book was a lot of fun, too.Included in the index is a nice resource section packed with websites, mailing addresses, and telephone numbers of noteworthy organizations. There are even sections in the book that touch briefly on canine massage techniques and the possibility of telepathic communication with dogs. Chapter 12 deals solely with various events and competitions dogs can enter and enjoy.This is a great book for anyone interested in strengthening the bond they share with their canine companion(s).",
