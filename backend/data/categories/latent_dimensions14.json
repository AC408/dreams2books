Any lab owner can agree, most of the stories found in this particular book, their lab has done at one time or another. In this book a labrador is more than just a companion. Great Book! I would recommend to all lab owners..",

This book covers alot more than health care. For instance, under caring for an older dog, the tips are practical, simple, and have nothing to do with medicine or illness. Simple things like buying the dog a softer bed. Life style changes that may not cure, as somethings cannot be, but can make your dogalot happier.Dog care books are usually either written by a vet, who takes the linear Western medicine approach, or a holistic practianer who never sees the need to darken a doctor's office. This book is written in a partnership between a vet and a holistic person and the book shows the wisdom of both and suggests when and how to use either one or both of the approaches. Good common sense abounds. And always practical information. In a section on diabetes the authors list the dog breeds most likely to be susceptible. If you have one of these breeds it may make recognizing the signs easier. They do this for most of the diseases they discuss.And they discuss alot more. Prevention, diet, homeopathy, herbs, TCM. bodywork, alternative therapies and conventional medicine, and more. It's a fat book packed with info.If you have a dog, you need this book....though in truth I think alot of what they say can be applied to any animal, including the human.",

I am a novice in this area of medicine but found the explanations clear, concise, and informative.I then turned to the puppy section - and found a wealth of valuable information on the importance of puppy socialization - how exposing my puppy to lots of different people, dogs and places, (after their vaccination series is complete, of course!), helps him learn manners, gives him confidence, and allows me the luxury and joy of taking him with me to many places without having to worry about his behavior. The book also discusses how to select a good and compassionate trainer.There is a section on \"Letting Go\" - always a difficult and painful part of sharing one's life with an animal. I found the author's advice personal and heartfelt.The chapters on new vaccination protocols and nutrition are informative and complete. Although the two authors recommend a homemade diet, they also tell the reader how to select a high quality commercial diet, as well.I appreciate the author's balanced view and the fact that they explain the \"why\" of things - something which is often lacking in many books. Excellent.The book is loaded with helpful tables and graphs and personal stories. In addition, there are great photos of \"Found Dogs\" sprinkled throughout the book.It is obvious these two authors love their topic and want to improve the lives of puppies, dogs, and their people. I will recommend it highly.",

I noticed lately, however, that I've gone to this book first over and over and often I don't need to look at any of my other books. I usually cross reference material, but I've found valididated information from several other sources in this book so often that I save myself the trouble and just reference this book now.Rarely do I find a \"the only book you'll need\" in any book, but this one definitely has it all, and the information is not extreme. The authors recognize balance, recognize that there are a variety of methods to attack a problem, and they present each method thoroughly and non-judgmentally.For example, if a dog is vomiting and has nausea, they first differentiate between acute and chronic. If acute, they first give information on nutritional support, then homeopathy, then herbs, then accupressure and finally other methods including flower essences and considering addressing the dog's emotional state. If chronic, they are just as thorough but give other paths to follow in trying to treat the dog's vomiting.In addition to concrete suggestions for treating many health problems, very clear and professionally drawn illustrations abound throughout the book. In the section for vomiting, one drawing shows the dog's digestive tract and another the accupressure points for the digestive tract. When referring to the illustration in the text, the authors also reference corresponding charts and additional illustrations in another part of the book (and give page numbers!) that will further explain information regarding that particular illustration, such as finding the exact meridian point on the dog.The treatments the authors focus on in the book include diet, homeopathy, herbs, accupressure, acupuncture, TCM, bodywork, and energy medicine. The authors touch on a few other areas of therapy but they focus primarily on the topics just mentioned.I found the illustrations to be extremely valuable. They are peppered throughout the book showing parts of the dog that are relevant to the corresponding text. The illustrations aren't too detailed; they have just enough to explain. They're clear, concise, and easy to understand.Overall, this is the best comprehensive book on holistic dog care on my shelf. I'm gradually getting rid of the others because they don't compare at all to the accurately named, \"The Complete Holistic Dog Book.\"",

I was intimidated by the responsibility of balancing a diet for a giant breed!As she grew, Jessie failed to thrive on kibble. By the time she was 10 months old, she was a walking skeleton and I added more &quot;home cooked&quot; to her diet with some success.Then she had a medical crisis brought on by my feeding her fat trying to get her to gain weight. Dr Katy and I sat on the floor of her clinic late into the night, giving her morphine to help with the pain, and I had to make the decision to put her down or see her through her problems. When she recovered, I was convinced that I needed to switch over completely to a home-cooked diet.Luckily, Katy's book came out the same week! Great timing, Katy!I have several highly recommended books on Natural Health Care for dogs, but Jan &amp; Katy's is the easiest for me to apply. It provides easy-to-follow instructions on food selection, preparation and balance. Using her guidelines I'm able to easily fix Jessie's meals as I fix my own - my diet's improving too!I was also pleased to find thorough sections describing major illnesses, health problems and injuries, and appreciate Jan &amp; Katy's common sense approach to herbs and alternative medicine.Results? You Bet! I bought the book at the end of September; Jessie was 11 months old, 30&quot; tall at the shoulder and weighed 74 pounds. A month later, Jessie has gained +25 pounds and is a strong vigorous dog. The change is phenomenal, and has convinced me that THIS is the way dog should eat!Jessie agrees! Thanks Dr Katy, for being there for the Jessie's of the world!Linda Cowles",

I find its descriptions very vague and not informative at all. It lists many different herbs and homeopathic medicines to give for different ailments, but it doesn't say why they work or if there are any side effects to them. I am sure it would be great for someone who already has an understanding of holistic medicine, but I don't. Also some of the viewpoints in the book I feel are wrong. Such as recommending making your dog a vegetarian and that dogs are not really carnivores. In fact I would say the whole chapter on diet is not very good information. Even some of the essential fatty acid sources they recommended (most of the vegetable oils) are not good for dogs. They are too high in omega 9 and actually cancel out the good omega 3 and 6's. It kind of makes me not trust any of the information in the book. And I feel diet is the most important part of a dog's health. I bought this book because it had such wonderful reviews. I wish this book had a look inside option. I don't think I will buy a book solely based on reviews again. Unless you already have a very good knowledge of homeopathy or just want to be told what to do with no explanation then I would not recommend this book. It was a waste of money for me.",

Saw this book, flipped through it in the book store and decided to get it. That simple. It has great information in it and bullets out just what I want to know. I also have the Natural Health Bible for Dogs & Cats : Your A-Z Guide to Over 200 Conditions, Herbs, Vitamins, and Supplements by Shawn Messonnier. Both of these books complement each other and provide what I need to know for taking care of my animals. Often, the herbs recommended correlate to the ones I'm taking (or that people take). I certainly don't mind sharing with my best friend and loyal companion.My quest initially started because my 7 YO schnoodle suddenly experienced a slipped disk and couldn't walk (essentially hind leg paralysis, both hind legs). I was completely distraught at the prospect of surgery on the little guy. After learning a local chiropractor (ours as it turns out) would take a look at him, I took him in. I consider it CAM - complementary alternative medicine. I kept him on steroids, and pain management, and the chiro adjusted him. By the next morning he was able to walk out of his cage (where the meds had clearly made him sick all night). I decided then and there that there is no question in my mind that there is something to be said for alternative therapies. No one can convince me otherwise. This dog dragged himself around for two days, and the vets told me they saw no improvement when they had him. I continue with touch therapy and supplements to his diet. But I will never forget this extraordinary and valuable lesson. Our families are valuable treasures and we are entrusted with good stewardship of our K9 companions. This book helps make that job a bit easier.",

All chapters of the book are valuable, but the section on diet and nutrition is particularly outstanding! Since reading the book, I have adopted a diet of home-cooked meals for my german-shepherd-mutt that is virtually 100% vegetarian! Seeing the way she responded to the new diet has converted many of my friends into believers who were total skeptics of a vegetarian diet.

Giving puppies supplements can seriously harm their skeletal growth, especially when fed a commercial diet. Giving supplements to any dog for anything but a specific purpose is just a waste of money.For a new puppy or dog owner this book may be useful as a guide toward building a good foundation, but other sources should be utilized as well (including Messonnier's \"Natural Health Bible for Dogs & Cats\"). For someone who is already well-versed in natural pet care: pass this one up.",

The chapters are filled with examples from Dr. Shawn's practice that help to reinforce the theme.I highly recommend this book to all dog owners!

                "review/text": "Let me say first that if you are going to buy this book (get it on sale!) and follow the program READ the entire book first before making a veterinary appointment...if you don't you may end up spending alot of money going back and forth to your vet. In this book the author recommends you take your dog to the vet and run a bunch of tests first. He does have some good concepts in here, less vaccines for dogs and more check ups. Honestly I only think you should do twice yearly check ups if you have a vet that is actually proactive (they are hard to find). He makes good points about how MANY vets don't even bother to aspirate (find out what is inside lumps on your dogs) really that is the only way besides surgery to check and see if lumps/tumors on your dog are cancer. If your vet doesnt recommend to aspirate every lump on your dog find a new vet! I believe the author is a great vet in his own right and if you happen to live in the area that he practices in I would def take my pet there...plus his diagnostic tests sound super cheap. He makes a good point about how yearly bloodtests and diagnostics should be done. I would probably only do bloodtesting and urine testing 1-2 year but wouldnt do the recommended xrays,teeth cleaning and EKG's. He makes a great point about dental cleaning and most dogs having peridontal disease (disease of the mouth)I agree with him there though my dog who chews bones everyday DOES not have it. He has a very interesting concept about skin disease/allergies in dogs, he recommend frequent bathing (daily or a few times a week) this makes sense to me. One thing that I strongly disagree with is microwaving your homemade dogfood...it really defeats the purpose of home cooking because you are actually radiating the food, killing enzymes and helpful things. I also don't necessary agree with giving your dog's supplements that are intended for dogs....if it's not human grade then it is \"ok\" for the product to be substandard (IMO). He recommends enzymes be given to the dogs, especially one called Prozyme which is a plant enzyme (which he tells you is a plant enzyme) that means it only breaks down plant material. If you are feeding a RAW food or non plant food it is useless (he didnt mention that). For geriatric dogs he recommends EKG and xrays yearly...in my belief over use of xrays ie radiation is harmful and will lead to cancer. So in that case not sure prevention is worth the overall risk (if that makes any sense). DONT buy this book if you think you are going to be told what types of herbal doses to give your pet. He highly recommends EVERYTHING be done under vet supervison. PLUS just note that just because a vet claims to be wholistic doesnt mean they are a good Dr (Dr. Messonnier sounds awesome) so do your research. We used a Wholistic vet that saw us coming and took us to the cleaners. I highly recommend the Martin Goldstein DVM book The Nature of Animal Healing (though wouldnt use his homecooked dogfood methods)",

                "review/text": "From the first sentence: \"The sky was dark, and he knew he was dying\" Mitchel Scanlon's first Black Library novel, Fifteen Hours, sweeps the reader up in a darkly evocative and almost sublimely grim tale of the recently conscripted Imperial Guardsmen Arvin Larn. It is clear that due to his attention to detail and the novel's seamless transition from the pastoral agri-planet of Jumal IV to the war-torn streets and trenches of the city of Broucheroc that Scanlon has a firm grasp of both the facts and the nuance of the bleak and violent future of humanity. He shows this knowledge in both in the far-distant future universe of Warhammer 40,000 in general and it's foremost military machine, the Imperium of Mankind's Imperial Guard in particular.Scanlon further punctuates the first person experiences of Trooper Larn with the occasional interlude where we are presented with insights into the characters and personalities of the Imperium that caused Trooper Larn to come to be at this hell-hole of a planet where he doesn't belong and in a war he has no part. We see through eyes and hear the thoughts everything from an Administratum Scribe to the Grand Marshall of a planetary army. Through these interludes we gain a further insight and the very real sense of an ominous future.This is not a novel for the feint of heart. Mitchel Scanlon is almost aggressive in his realistic portrayal of the dark and at times hopeless life of a lowly infantryman of the Imperial Guard. He is, without a doubt, the first author of the Warhammer 40k universe that may actually present the universe as too grim, if such a thing can be said and it is clear he is no fan of the officer ranks. At times, this reality he confronts you with is so surprising that it will hit you in face and leave you jarred for a chapter or two. However, there is a method to Scanlon's madness, his sensuously morbid portrayal of the universe makes those rare moments of Pyrrhic victory, of laugh-out-loud levity, and even of hope feel all the more powerful and moving. I don't mind telling you, its one hell of an experience.",

                "review/text": "I'll admit it right away: a significant proportion of the 40K fiction that I've read seems almost as though it's written itself. While this certainly has something to do with how rich the universe is -- and how well Games Workshop has fleshed out so many aspects of that richness -- it can leave Black Library novels feeling a bit stale.I have found very few BL books satisfying -- the only three in the past few years have been the uniformly wonderful Uriel Ventris novels from Graham McNeill. This book was certainly satisfying, but in a much different way.As a child, I read Remarque's \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" and it helped to change my boyish illusions of war forever. This book -- truly, a novella more than a novel --, while certainly not \"All Quiet\" by any means, evokes those same feelings. There is a power in this story that is well-expressed by the soldier who reviewed it: this is how it is. This is not madmen in power armor cleaving through thousands of tyranid monsters while sustaining minor scratches -- it's war.To those that mentioned the unsatisfying ending, the unpolished prose, and the ease with which they were able to put the book down, I ask: do you believe that reality always has a satisfying ending, especially for those that take up arms to protect us? Are you certain that you were not tempted to take up a more formulaic and rosy book, rather than face the harsher ugliness of this one?As for the unpolished writing -- I agree, there were some spots that could have been better edited. However, I question any unfavorable comparison between this and other pieces of Black Library fiction: even the excerpts from \"Gaunt's Ghosts\" included in the Imperial Guard codex itself could have used some fairly heavy editing.In short, I found this book to be a readable, evocative account of life and death. That it took place within the 40K universe is secondary. The story itself was excellent and well-told. In a way, I feel as though this book may, as mentioned by another reviewer, have been a bit darker than other 40K fiction, and therefore a bit mature for the folks who have come to expect the sword-spinning antics of superhuman genetically-engineered monsters.A great book: definitely worth a read.",

The slight touch of how an individual's actions have 2nd & 3rd order effects on others, and how long, or short, a time you've been in a combat situation, death waits for you.

I've read some parts that make me feel I was in that battlefield.It remind me some stories about WW I in the trenches. It add some good perpective about the guardsman life and the connection between them and their superiors.There is one part that blow me away and made me tremble..\"From the corners of his eye Larn caught gimpses of the others around him. He saw Bulaven, a lasgun in his hands taken from other Guardsman. He saw Davir. Scholar. Zeebers. He saw Chalker, his expression cool and detached, working the slide of his shotgun to send round after round into the enemy. He saw Vladek. Medical Oficer Svenk. The cook, Trooper Skench, a laspistol blazing in his one remaining hand as he stood besides others. He saw their faces. Scholar drawn yet steadfast. Bulaven dutiful, Zeebers nervous, Davir spiting obscene and angry oaths at the advancing orks. He saw steely determination and a refual to go easily to death. AS he saw it, Larn felt a feelting shame that he had doubted these men when he had first met them. Whatever their manner they were all wahat a Guardsman should be. Brave. Resolute. Unbending in the gace of the enemy. These were the men on which the Imperium had been built. The men who had fought its every battle. Won its every victory. Today, they were hoepelessly outnumbered.Today it was their final stand.(page 227)After reading this book, and before as well I prefer the guardsman stories than to Marines stories.Other reviewer said this was a teeneger writing or something. I agree. It's not like Dan Abnett or Ian Watson. But I guess this \"teenager\" writing made this book even greater. The common soldier is not a writer or poet. I guess that made us see almost from the eyes of the main character. It was good also 'cause the pages were turning even faster.Overall..

This story is much more intimate, focusing on a fireteam of Guardsmen dug into the trenches of a war they know they're losing, and Larn, a new Guard who, through a tragic, trivial turn of events, is accidentally brought into their ranks and forced to survive the next fifteen hours under their tutelage.Scanlon's writing is simple, effective, and true, and he does a great job of conveying the camaraderie that the Guardsmen share in the face of insurmountable odds and a relentless enemy.Looking forward to reading more of Scanlon's work!",

More than once I found myself nearly crying during study period at college because I was laughing so hard.Some of my favorite shorts were &quot;The Card Over the Bed&quot;, &quot;Tricki Woo&quot;, &quot;Granville Bennett&quot;, &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Donovan&quot; -- the latter being my favorite. (Mrs. Donovan was a crone who patrolled the streets of Darrowby trying to cure people's animals quite often causing strife for Mr. Herriot.)The very best thing about this book, aside from it being a quick and easy read, is that the stories are broken up so that you can put it down at any time and come back to it without fear of having lost your place.James Herriot was the master of animal literature. Never have I encountered a more tasteful writer who so accurately depicted the behavior of dogs. I am a huge animal lover having two cats and a dog of my own. I found amazing similarities between the antics of the dogs showcased in this book and my own golden lab, and reading it made me want to cuddle him closer.",

Although trained as a vet, James Herriot had a true gift with the written word. These tales about pets and their two-legged counterparts shine a light deep into the mechanisms of human nature.While he succeeded admirably as an honorable animal doctor and found worldwide fame as a late-in-life author, perhaps he missed his true calling as a psychologist.

TrickiWoo, a Pekingese, picks winning horses at the races. And Gyp, an epileptic sheepdog, only barked once in his entire life.

This sounded perfect for me. I was very disappointed reading this book. I found a number of the stories to be uninteresting and I felt a few were very poorly written. While I will admit that a few (and I mean a very few) of the short stories were good the majority of them were appalling to any dog lover that I know and many of them had nothing but a brief mention of a dog in them. It truly is not a book for dog lovers or even remote animal lovers. If I had known what this book was really about, I wouldn't have spent my hard earned money on it and would urge others not to bother. Borrow someone else's copy or see if the local library has a copy but don't spend your money in hopes of some good dog stories because you won't find them in this book. As for the literary value of this book, it might be more highly respected if it wasn't so misrepresented and marketed to dog or animal lovers but I doubt it.",

The men in these pages represent all branches of the military who were sent on impossible missions, where they witnessed triumphs and tragedies. As a result of Drez's ten years of research and over 1,400 interviews, Twenty-Five Yards of War is a tribute to all of the soldiers who fought in World War II--those who walked away with amazing stories to tell, and those who did not make it home.",

Some of the more famous actions covered are Doolittle's raid on Tokyo, the battles for Iwo Jima and Betio, and the 82nd drop into Normandy. My favorite account in this book is the little known stand made by Lt. Lyle Bouck and an I&amp;R platoon from the 99th Infantry Division. This untested unit just happened to be at the town of Lanzerath when the Battle of the Bulge started. They were ordered to hold until relieved. The men fought hard until they were killed, overrun, or surrendered when out of ammunition. Although badly outgunned and outnumbered, they managed to hold up advancing German infantry and armored units long enough for engineering units at critical points behind them to blow up bridges and further delay the German advance. Their gallant stand bought time for reinforcements to arrive and stem the tide of battle. This is an enjoyable read and will appeal to anyone with an interest in WWII. The author was instrumental in the research for Ambrose's book, &quot;D-Day June 6th, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II&quot;.",

Drez tells the heroic stories of 12 men who have shown inspiring courage in their contribution to the United States' World War II effort.It was interesting that those men and all who contributed to the war were named &quot;Warriors&quot;. These warriors were &quot;called upon to bear unswerving allegiance to the nation...and to surrender part of their own rights and freedoms so the people they protect can better enjoy their own. And this service is predestined to be forgotten&quot;. This quote awakened me to the tremendous gratitude that is owed to all those who have unselfishly fought for their country. The warrior theme was appropriately carried out throughout the book. In every story, each soldier, no matter what branch he was in, pushed himself to the limit to get that victory for the U.S. He never worried about whether someone back home would appreciate his deed.The book kept me engrossed in a way that truly made me excited about history, especially World War II. I had learned about the Doolitte Raid, Battles of Midway and Tarawa, Invasion of Normandy, Battle of the Bulge, and Iwo Jima, but the book expanded upon that knowledge in a way that was clear and easy to read. Also, focusing on one person's experience at each of the battles helped me to have a better understand of what hardships and successes the soldiers went through.I encountered, for the first time, information on the development of U.S. submarines, like U.S.S. Barb, throughout WWII. I was shocked at the number of deaths occurring on both sides of the war. After every battle the numbers were listed off in the range of hundreds to thousands of men. It was sad for me to think that each man probably had a remarkable story to tell just like the 12 men featured in the book.Overall, the book was exciting, and was good for me in clarifying basic information. For example, I correlated, for the first time, that The Battle of the Philippine Sea was the same thing as The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot. The book is a good read for someone who is interested in World War II.",

The Twenty-Five yards of war from the title refer to the individual in combat and how major events of conflict impact the individual. Some of the events such as Doolittle's raid over Tokyo and the sinking of the USS Indianapolis are well known but some of the stories are much less familiar. By seeing events unfold from the soldier, sailor, airman, and marine's perspective you feel like you're part of the battle. The book is well-written and each story keeps your attention. One of the great surprises of this book involved the actions of Navy flyers during the Battle of the Philippine Sea. After the Marianas Turkey Shoot where over 350 Zeros were destroyed, the Japanese made a run to escape. The Task Force 58 commander decided to try to intercept the naval force with airpower but the distances involved meant that the Navy pilots would be flying \"one-way\" missions and ditching at night on the return leg. Almost eighty aircraft splashed into the ocean on the return flight and the next day, half of those pilots were recovered along the path of their flight. You'll learn similar facts in the other eleven stories. You won't be disappointed.",

And he gives us the most effective road map for that healing available, in my opinion as a student of A Course in Miracles.For this reason, I give Jerry's autobiography 5 stars even though I wish his editor had been more assertive in asking him to replace his repetitive reiterations of Course principles with more of his potent personal stories that illustrate those principles much more enjoyably and cogently. I humbly read through the didactic parts because I know that the Course is so challenging and our egos so cunning that no amount of repetition is too much. But it was much more interesting and edifying to breeze through his personal stories.I thank Jerry with all my heart for helping me to awaken with this book and with his others (Love is Letting Go of Fear, Goodbye to Guilt, and One Person Can Make a Difference), which I also highly recommend.",

Now, with her first collection--seventeen stories that span her entire career--Jeanette Winterson reveals all the facets of her extraordinary imagination. Whether transporting us to bizarre new geog-raphies--a world where sleep is illegal, an island of diamonds where the rich wear jewelry made of coal--or revealing so perfectly, so exactly, the joy and pain of owning a brand-new dog, she proves herself a master of the short form.

I'm not a lesbian or gay, and I still appreciate the fine writing I found in The World and Other Places. This book is introduced as a collection of stories. While there are some sort narratives, many of the pieces in this collection could be considered prose poems. In these little portraits, Winterson uses peculiar and striking metaphor to describe the love between people (and even between one person and a dog). Most of these prose-poems linger after you read them, and warrant a second look or closer reading. With vast subjects ranging from time and space and love, it is difficult to grasp the meaning after one quick glance over. Winterson also shows a great deal of breath: the narration and main characters vary greatly as you move through the book. The comments in the narrations have several points that do make you try and interpret what exactly is being said. One of my only gripes is that some of the pieces are very political. Somehow, a few of the stories or prose poems reminded me of the last hundred pages of Richard Wright's Native Son. Rather than telling an interesting story will issues to be discussed, Winterson just latches on to a sort of in your face, &quot;I'm a lesbian, so that makes this special&quot; message, which, rather than being interesting, just bored me most of the time. Other than that, there were really only minor draw backs for me (meaning, maybe I didn't like a story or two. Isn't that expected?). I admit that I enjoy strange stories, so, of course, this book is not for every reader, and I'm sure there will be many reader who do not accepted its slightly bizarre presentation. If there is one that proves that a book is good, it would be that the book makes the reader want to read more of the author's work. This is the case for me after I read The World and Other Places. This is definitely a book to read, if, for anything, to get a different perspective and flesh the kinds of books you read out a little.",

For me this book was just like that. In my book there are forty- five scary stories, but I think the scariest one was \"Knock, Knock, Knock.\" It's about this girl and her boyfriend that were going out to eat, but their car dies. It was a stormy night and a notice on the radio said that a crazy guy was on the loose, but the had to find a repair shop for their car. So her boy friend said he would go find one and when he came back he would knock on the car door three times. (spoiler)Another spooky story was called \"A Night Of Terrors.\" The story is mostly about a young girl and her dog. There is another scary maniac on the loose again and the girl is at home with her dog. She was feeling really depressed and her dog was under the bed. She put her hand down over the bed and he licked it as always. Then suddenly a police man burst in the door and told her she had to get out of the house.(spoiler) .For me this was a really great book but my favorite short story was probably \"Knock, Knock, Knock,\" because it seemed the scariest. The story I didn't really like was, \"A Night Of Terrors,\" because it was really creepy and kind of sad. (spoiler) The characters in the story were either dead, scared to death, or completely crazy. I'm not sure if I want to read this story again, I probably have nightmares or just be freaked out.",

Having read a lot of the dog literature over the last 15 years, including struggling through some of the classics like Scott and Fuller, I was left with questions about what theories and practices were valid, and which had been superceded by further research that perhaps I hadn't discovered yet.Lindsay puts the entire science of dog training and behavior into perspective, with astonishing completeness, brilliant organization, and elegant writing. He sorts through the history of our knowledge of dogs, discriminating between that which is good science and that which is not-so-good science. He compares and contrasts the theories and experiments of every person who has had anything to say that's relevant to what we know about dogs, including those from the fields of human and other species learning.I especially appreciated the outlines at the beginning of every chapter, and the bibliographies at the end of every chapter (as well as at the end of the book). Some of the content is of special interest to me, and he makes it easy for me to go straight to the original sources.His discussion of aversive training is outstanding, clarifying what has been a much misunderstood area in the last few years. And in spite of the scientific approach (\"what do we really know\"), Lindsay is able to discuss the softer issues of animal awareness and mysticism with touching grace.The sheer quantity of literature that Lindsay has read and digested - and summarized for our benefit - is absolutely mindboggling. This book is a must-read for anyone who has a serious interest in dogs.",

His approach is above all scientific, which doesn't mean he avoids phenomena like ESP etc., nor does he simply give a description of the autorities' viewpoints. Lindsay also carefully analyses everything commonly accepted by laymen and experts, without resorting to emotional arguments. His systematic and straightforward 'nothing to hide' approach as well as his concern to include all practices and opinions certainly makes this book an authoritative study which counterbalances a lot of 'extreme' books on dog training (like Jean Donaldsons controversial book 'the culture clash' or the Koehler books).For everything said in the book, scientific research and logical reasoning serves as basis, and sentimentality doesn't get a chance. Lindsay clearly stresses the reasons behind behavioral tactics and leaves the choice to the reader, providing all scientific facts necessary to support your decision. His view on the use of aversives is the most enlightening and waterproof explication I've read on why, how and when to use it -- or not...Lindsay concentrates a lot on theoretical models to understand all kinds of phenomena. He never annoyed by giving too much information. Monuments of psychology like Skinner and Thorndike are equally critically analyzed as less famous men and at all time Lindsay remains consistent in his application of a thorough scientific approach to clearify and explain.It isn't a cheap book, but it certainly lived up to my (high) expectations. The reference section at the end of each chapter provides a good means of exploring more studies and Lindsay doesn't hesitate to give suggestion for further reading. He acknowledges without hesitation the accomplishments of other people without idealizing them (he criticizes Skinners and Thorndikes view on punishment etc.).I think it will take a long time before a more open and thorough book on dog behavior will appear. Therefore, if you want a book that gives a complete and detailed account of what is known on dog behavior and that provides a solid basis to expand your knowledge (even very rare phenomena are treated in detail), I would certainly recommend this book.

Most books on the subject of dogs in general are short overviews that should take care of some specific needs, such as potty training, obedience, tricks, etc. This book has a culmination of 100+ years of scientific research and other case studies of not only dogs but of the behavior mentally and physically of other creatures and how they apply to dogs. There is so much information to soak in, its incredible. I read through it occasionally had to sit back in awe thinking about what i've just read and how many things make sense now.I seriously think that most books will get 90% of dog owners by without a problem.

The Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training should appeal to canine professionals as well as anyone looking for an in-depth analysis of canine origins, neurobiology and behavior. This is the first of Lindsay's comprehensive three-volume set. It begins with the origins of dogs, covers the neurobiology of behavior and learning, and sensory abilities of dogs. The behavior section goes to great lengths describing classical and operant conditioning, the effect of aversives on behavior, and much more. A multitude of fascinating studies are referenced throughout the book.

As a kid, I put more into getting ready for my turn to present than I put into the rest of my homework. Show-and-Tell was real in a way that much of what I learned in school was not. It was education that came out of my life experience. As a teacher, I was always surprised by what I learned from these amateur hours. A kid I was sure I knew well would reach down into a paper bag he carried and fish out some odd-shaped treasure and attach meaning to it beyond my most extravagant expectation. Again and again I learned that what I thought was only true for me . . . only valued by me . . . only cared about by me . . . was common property. The principles guiding this book are not far from the spirit of Show-and-Tell. It is stuff from home-that place in my mind and heart where I most truly live. P.S.

A lot of storytellers have made a fine living that way. If that's what you want, escapism, then you'll find it in this book. It's just that Fulghum and I apparently don't have the same worldview or appreciation for the same things.",

Fulghum quotes from Horace in Latin and from the Septuagint in Greek, and describes attending a talk on chaos theory at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, but makes it all sound plain and easy.He mentions \"Apocalypse Now\" but not the Book of Revelations. He is a long way from original sin and Calvinism. I think the central message is that there is much good in people and you can bring it out by being patient and being nice to them.

                "review/text": "If you've read my other reviews, you know I am a HUGE Robert Fulghum fan. He is my mentor - the reason I began writing my first book that got its first contract. This book is almost funnier and better than the one before, if that's even possible, but only almost. This book inspired me and made me think, made me cry, and made me laugh. You can't ask for a better read than that!The title piece of the book talks about a man who was interviewed by the news for a house fire. The question posed to the man was how the fire, which was in the bedroom, from the mattress, had started. The man had answered that he didn't know how the fire had started, since the bed was in fire when he lay down on it. Mr. Fulghum talks about how we do that, sometimes: lay down on burning beds. This is, of course, a metaphor for us making poor decisions, decisions not in our best interests, when we know this is the case when we're making them.And that is the best example of what Mr. Fulghum's writing in all his essays and books I've read have been, including this book. It Was on Fire When I lay Down on It is a series of poignant memoir-style essays, each with their own metaphorical 'lesson' or moral to them... some are touching and moving while others are giggle and snort funny, but all of them speak to a bigger picture or a deeper meaning if you're willing to look beyond the implied. Well worth the read.I agree with some about his attitude about dogs. I am a dog lover. My Jake is my son, my furry fur-legged brat dog and I love him dearly, but I can't see discrediting an entire man and his entire library or work and contributions to literature, reading, faith and humor just because his opinions differ from mine on one point. The stories he tells are not graphic in nature about his dislike of dogs, so I take those with a grain of salt and move on to the other more poignant things with which I can relate. I will never agree 100% with anyone on everything, and this is simply a point of division in mind between me and Mr. Fulghum. To stop reading him for his personal opinions when he is doing no physical damage (it's just opinion), is something I'm not wont to do.",

In essence, this story-ette is about a priest and his meaning of life, and a small mirror...he believes the meaning of life is to bring light to dark places, a game he used to play when he was a kid with sunlight and a mirror. That game has become a metaphor for his life. So I bought the book for that reason, for a few little pages.

Most of them start in the traditions of fairy tales, with bold knights, beautiful princesses, powerful kings, and deadly dragons. As in traditional fairy tales, some describe great quests, while others narrate hubris and downfall. The difference is that every story is peopled (if you'll pardon the term) by robots. It creates a grand setting for Lem's adventures and warmly humorous inversion of all the old storytelling.The final two stories, though, are the real gems of this collection. They are longer, they feature humans as well as robots, and are serious, even somber in tone. One is told by a human, part of the party that has to hunt down a dangerous robot across the stark surface of the moon. The teller finds the rogue in the end and fells it, but something in that last moment turns it from victory into completion of a much more ambiguous kind. The final story, \"The Mask,\" is a sensitive look into a man-made mind. It conveys real complexity in the robot's sense of its own life. One of the story's many readings is a warning that, even if the feelings are carried in metal cases, they're as real to the minds feeling them as ours are to us. Creating a mind that can feel such feelings imposes a responsibility on the creator - a responsibility not met in this chilling story.This is Lem at his best, and his best is very good. The happy satire of the first stories is some of Lem's most amusing. The conjecture in the last story is some of his darkest. The set as a whole shows Lem's range as a writer, even within the constraints that unify this wonderful collection.//wiredweird",

Included are all the tales from Lem's \"Fables for Robots\" and three other stories (\"The Sanatorium of Dr. Vliperdius,\" \"The Hunt,\" and \"The Mask\") that double the size of the book.The fables are like--well, fables. That is, the prose style resembles Aesop or Andersen (\"Once there lived...\"); the narrative recounts long-ago events; and each tale presents a message--or, at least, a lesson for us humans disguised as a moral for them robots. These eleven shorts recall Borges (or even Poe) at his most playful, but read in sequence they tend to become a tad formulaic (several robots are sent on a mission; each fails, but the last one succeeds). And if you're a lover of science jokes, these stories will be your playground; Lem packs references to chemistry, physics, geology, computer science, and electronics--often in the same sentence: \"self-motes came from distant lands, like the two Automatts, vector-victors in a hundred battles, or like Prostheseus, constructionist par excellence, who never went anywhere without two spark absorbers, one black, the other silver; and there was Arbitron Cosmoski, all built of protocrystals and svelte as a spire....\"If, like me, you prefer a little more story and a little less pun, you'll find that the gems of the book are the three bonus tracks. The last two, in particular, are among the best I've ever read by Lem, and have nothing in common with the fables other than the automaton theme. \"The Hunt\" is a rollicking adventure story featuring Lem's famous alter ego, Pirx the Pilot, on a mission to destroy a homicidal robot. \"The Mask\" may well be the best Lem story I've read: the haunting stream-of-consciousness of a robot who, like an otherworldly Tristram Shandy, narrates its own birth, consciousness, self-realization, metamorphosis, rebellion, and--above all--its futile pursuit of love. The opening pages have a deceptively languid pace, until the robot sheds its \"mask\" (in a surprisingly squeamish scene) and, during the ensuing chase, reveals its lethal assignment. These last stories are worth the price of the whole book.",

What is less easily fathomed is the fact that the book has never really garnered much attention, something that Hannah Arendt comments on in her rather disappointing introduction to this fine book.Gray's \"Warriors\" is that rare combination of lucid intellectualism and poignancy that ought to be an immediate success with readers, yet the book remains obscure (indeed, I had to order it since my local seller didn't stock it). Ironically, it addresses many topics that should be of interest to contemporary scholars: trauma and what we now call PTSD, memory and forgetfulness, objectification, guilt.... Gray also ruminates on what he calls the appeal of battle. At various points I was reminded of the psychological insights of Robert Jay Lifton, whoseThe Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocideintroduced the idea of \"Doubling\" (as Lifton calls it). And there is plenty of evidence for Lifton's psychological theory in this book, though Gray doesn't refer to it as such.What makes Gray's book so impressive is his ability to remain critically aloof and emotionally close to his topic at the same time--a very tricky proposition that he pulls off marvelously. He very smoothly juxtaposes passages from Plato and Shakespeare to those from his own personal letters or war journal, the latter of which is moving without ever being maudlin or depressing.If Gray's last chapter, \"The Future of War,\" seems dated and hopelessly optimistic, I think we can forgive him. Gray, like the existentialists who were his contemporaries, cites Nietzsche here, but unlike them, he suggests that one day we may have the superhuman strength to \"break our swords\" once and for all. Sadly, as our present world stage confirms, ubermenschen we still are not.",

What we have instead is a look at the range of attitudes different soldiers have toward battle, love, death, the enemy and guilt. What some readers might derisively describe as \"moral equivalency\" on Gray's part, is really objectivity, born perhaps of his academic experience in garnering a doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University.What gives this book its real value is that Gray's academic thoroughness is combined with a keenness of insight into human nature. He deftly catalogues the gamut of psychological and emotional conditions that are manifested in the behavior of men in combat. One of his major conclusions, that men fight, not for their country or lofty ideals, but for their \"comrades\" in arms, should come as no surprise to anyone well read in infantry memoirs from WWII. I place quotes around the word \"comrades\" because Gray assigns to that word a very specific meaning.As for drawbacks: There is no index, footnotes or bibliography. Also, the last section on \"The Future of War\" could have been omitted since it seems too optimistic and utopian in tone compared to the grim realism of the earlier chapters.The Warriors is an important book for anyone wanting to look beyond the cheerleading of the \"Good War\" or \"Greatest Generation\" and see what really animated the men who fought in WWII. As the author says, it is war that compresses the greatest extremes of the human condition into the smallest of ranges in time and space, and no more so than in the unprecedented savagery of WWII.",

                "review/text": "Clifford D. Simak's _The Worlds of Clifford D. Simak_ (1960) is a collection of a dozen good Simak stories published between 1954 and 1958. One is from _Infinity_, two are from _Astounding_, and nine are from _Galaxy_. Two stories (\"Idiot's Crusade\" and \"Founding Father\") are chillers. One (\"Death Scene\") is bittersweet. But the tone of most of the stories is that of gentle humor.Probably the best-known story in the collection is Simak's Hugo-winning novelette, \"The Big Front Yard\". It's the one about the Yankee handyman and trader who begins to notice strange goings-on in his house. And then there is a discovery made outside his front door that proves great for the handyman, his dog Towser (Simak stories frequently feature dogs), and his retarded assistant. I have read this story over half a dozen times over the years, and it still holds up well.Two other stories in which the \"little guy\" emerges triumphant over the forces of bureaucracy are \"Operation Stinky\" and \"Green Thumb\". The first is the one in which the little skunklike alien tricks the Air Force brass. The second involves a county agent who investigates unusual holes and soil samples appearing in his territory-- and forms an alliance with some alien plants. (There is a dog in this story, too.) \"Idiot's Crusade\" is still another tale in which the little guy wins. But this time, the results are horrific rather than comic.Four stories-- \"Honorable Opponent,\" \"Founding Father,\" \"Jackpot,\" and \"Lulu\"-- involve humans who go out into space and run into some strange situations Out There. The first story is about the Army brass who must meet the teddybearlike aliens who have whipped them in battle to discuss terms of surrender. The second tale is about delusions planted in the mind of a spaceman that begin to take over his life. The third is about a spaceship crew (not, shall we say, like that of the _Enterprise_) that discovers that it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive. And the fourth is about the lovesick ship's computer with a taste for soppy poetry.Three stories in which Earthmen make alien contacts that are not to their advantage are \"Dusty Zebra,\" \"Carbon Copy,\" and \"Neighbor\". The first is about a boy who finds a way to trade with denizens of a parallel word and about his father, who is too clever for his own good. The second dramatizes a real estate scam that backfires on the agent. The third (_another_ story with a dog!) is about the alien who literally has a way to keep people down on the farm. This story is marvelously told, but it always bothered me a bit. It describes what amounts to a benevolent dictatorship.\"Death Scene\" is the most unusual tale in the book. Suppose that everybody could see exactly twenty-four hours into the future. The story is about an elderly man who _knows_ that he will shortly die-- and how he and his family quietly prepare for the event. The tale is so beautifully told, it seems almost petty to point out the flaw in the story: Not everyone will die quietly, painlessly, peacefully, or in dignity.Simak has often (and accurately) been called an author of pastoral science fiction. \"Neighbor\" is the purest pastoral piece in the book, since it deals with a spot of country isolated from the rest of the world. But there is a \"small town\" feel to many of the other stories as well. Aliens in these stories may be a bit strange, but they are usually benevolent-- just plain folks. Simak's world is a world in which many problems can be solved by dickering, playing chess, going fishing, or swapping drinks from a bottle. It's a world that I enjoyed visiting. I suspect that you will like it as well.",

The anit-Semitism Al Cohen experienced is well described but not overdone. Lynch makes his point and moves on like a good writer. The personal views of these men are insightful and Lynch makes them come alive after nearly 60 years. If anything, I wish it were a longer book.",

        "description": "Dr. Billinghurst's most important piece of writing is the book Give Your Dog a Bone. Because cats and dogs have different food requirements, (cats are obligate carnivores while dogs are omnivores with a carnivorous background), he decided they each needed their own book, and that he would write the dog book first. Thus was born Give Your Dog a Bone. This book was launched at a 3 day Bichon Frise conference in western Sydney on the 17th November 1993. The book was advertised in all the canine breeder magazines throughout Australia. Give Your Dog a Bone? proved an instant hit, with many breeders adopting its ideas. Since that time it has been making steady inroads into the minds of breeders and dog owners throughout Australia and overseas. To date nearly fifty thousand copies of this book have been sold. Give Your Dog a Bone is the book that began the worldwide BARF dietary revolution for pets and remains 'the book' to read on the subject of BARF. It remains the practical common sense way to feed any dog for a long healthy life. It is the only book available that deals exclusively with feeding dogs their natural or evolutionary diet. This book contains vital information for all dog owners. It is a must for the owners of new puppies. Its 320 pages are packed with practical authoritative dog feeding advice that will drastically reduce vet bills. It shows that a dog's diet, which is based on raw meaty bones, is simple to produce, promotes health and is inexpensive. Give Your Dog a Bone explains why processed foods are the major cause of growth, reproductive, dental and most of the degenerative diseases including problems such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis, kidney failure, cardiac disease, the auto-immune diseases etc.",

I knew dogs needed the calcium from bones. I thought it was enough to provide ground bone in their meals. I never anticipated that pets might derive satisfaction from doing what God intended them to. Rip, tear and crunch. My dog, up to that point, had been happily living on pooch meat patties I bought from the market. In this book, Dr. Billinghurst condemned these. He said they robbed a dog of satisfaction.Made sense to me. My dog is a rescue. She has issues. She needed some satisfaction.It was so funny giving her her first chicken wing. She had NO idea what to do with it. This really surprised me! She knew she wanted it. She whined and danced around the bone. She licked it and whined some more. My Persian, on the other hand, took to it like Jabba the Hutt.In the past, she'd had taken only two or three minutes to wolf down her food. Sometimes she'd barf it right back up. Too much, too fast. But with the wings, she takes anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes to eat. She really enjoys her food. Often she makes little noises like a nursing puppy.To top it off, she had an emotional break through as a result. As an abused dog, Honey had a lot of issues. Some manifested as her over eating. Some manifested as destructive behavior. After putting her on raw meaty bones (complimented with Orbee Tough toys during the day), these behaviors ended. Also, while she remains a very high energy pooch, she is no longer manic.The sad ending to this story is that, I just discovered Dr. Billinghurst has sold out. I liked his book so much I went looking for more. Sadly, his third book advocates exactly what he condemns in his first book. Prefab doggie meat patties. I guess he smelled the profit factor.While it's true that a dog can live a happy life on these patties, don't deny your dog the satisfaction of a raw meaty bone.Also, I have an issue with Brewer's Yeast. If you won't give your pet by-products of a meat plant, why give them by-products of a brewery? Brewer's yeast is bitter and can cause gas. The alternative is often cheaper as well. Because the focus is health. Not making profit off of trash. \"Nutritional yeast\" is grown specifically for its nutrient qualities. It has a mild cheddar taste that both my dog and my cats love. You can sprinkle it on food or mix it with a little water and flax seed oil to make a yummy and nutritious sauce. As a side note, it goes great on popcorn.",

HOWEVER, this is a book of significance for any who really care about those animals, who by no choice of their own, depend upon human beings for their existance.Basicly, I see a dog as a dog, not a little, slightly retarded person. If a dog can be saved, save it and give a good life. If a dog can't be saved, give it as much comfort and love as possible in its remaining time. I have found this diet to turn around animals faster and to a more robust state of health than I have often believed possible for my animals.

So he makes it easy for someone who is skeptical to just dismiss the whole raw feeding thing altogether. This book is very repetitive, each chapter is basically some new info with a bunch of the old info rehashed over again (with no supporting evidence, of course... just 'take my word for it'). If you are looking for 'proof' that raw feeding is the right way to go, I'd recommend reading Tom Lonsdale's books instead (Raw Meaty Bones, Work Wonders). If you're the type of person that isn't looking for proof, but rather 'how to', then this book is probably Okay for that. Another issue that I have is the cheesy cartoons throughout the entire book. It takes a lot away from the author's professionalism & credibility. The 'Work Wonders' book from Lonsdale has the same sort of silly artwork, ????Oh, & another concern... Billinghurst has his own line of special 'supplements' which are ridiculously overpriced, & has a website 'Barfworld' that you have to pay an annual membership fee to be involved with it.

A thirty-year old with no loss of function is identical to a twenty-year-old, he says. And the same is true for fully functional people in their sixties--they are the same as thirty-year-olds. According to Shallenberger, the loss of functions that result from aging are themselves the result of energy loss: more energy, less aging; less energy, more aging. When Dr. Shallenberger discusses anti-aging methods, he is actually talking about improving energy production. His work with patients over the years has proven that an energy deficit is the root cause of every disease and symptom, from cancer, to fatigue, to obesity.",

Its all explained here in a very straight forward yet detailed way.There is a big difference between getting older and aging. To avoid aging as we get older, back to basics is a great place to start: Drink plenty of clean water, not bottled or tap. Get plenty of sleep AND good rest, not pill induced sleep and manic vacations. Eat whole organic food not processed junk food. Exercise, do both resistance and cardio. Meditate. Take a few quality supplements. Get regular sunshine. Breathe clean air and get plenty of oxygen. Have some fun. These are the kinds of things that are so obvious yet we've become completely separated from how simple and powerful these simple things are a prescription for long lasting health and a vital life.What's great about Bursting With Energy is that the 'WHY' is explained in detail so you have a genuine appreciation of just how powerful these lifestyle choices really are. And as both an MD and a Naturopath, Frank informs with a very broad yet even-handed approach.I see my clients everyday in my Full Spectrum Coaching practice become transformed by the simple application of these principles. They drop weight, look younger and healthier, feel better, have more energy, are able to focus and concentrate like never before, have an awesome sex life, greater confidence, are more successful, and lead happier lives in general. What's really interesting is how much scientific data has come out in the last 15 years to support what are truly the secrets to happiness. In fact, I recommend they read this book as one of the support texts for the work we do together.Honestly, this is as good or better than any comparable best seller on the market in terms of content and delivery.

At the time I read it I had been looking for an approach to dog training that didn't rely on the harsh corrections recommended by proponents of the alpha theory, which were all the rage at the time. Campbell was only the second author I read who claimed that the alpha theory wasn't relevant to training. (Kevin Behan, author of NATURAL DOG TRAINING, 1992, was the other.) What's even more brilliant is that Campbell wrote his book in the 1970s, long before we all found out that the alpha theory is a total myth! (The top wolf experts don't even like to use the word alpha anymore because, as Dr. L. David Mech puts it, \"it falsely implies a hierarchical system in which each wolf assumes a place in a linear pecking order,\" (Canadian Journal of Zoology, 2002).)I especially like Campbell's \"jolly routine\" exercise and his distraction/praise approach to stopping a puppy from doing natural, though destructive, behaviors, as opposed to using physical corrections or scolding the pup.That said, I've found that many of the other exercises-like \"no free lunch\" (now called NILIF)-don't really work. And some-like the exercise for keeping the dog from going through a door ahead of you-are completely unnecessary. That's why I'm only giving BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS IN DOGS three stars. It's still worth reading though, especially if you're a dog trainer.",

                "review/text": "Clifford D. Simak's _The Worlds of Clifford D. Simak_ (1960) is a collection of a dozen good Simak stories published between 1954 and 1958. One is from _Infinity_, two are from _Astounding_, and nine are from _Galaxy_. Two stories (\"Idiot's Crusade\" and \"Founding Father\") are chillers. One (\"Death Scene\") is bittersweet. But the tone of most of the stories is that of gentle humor.Probably the best-known story in the collection is Simak's Hugo-winning novelette, \"The Big Front Yard\". It's the one about the Yankee handyman and trader who begins to notice strange goings-on in his house. And then there is a discovery made outside his front door that proves great for the handyman, his dog Towser (Simak stories frequently feature dogs), and his retarded assistant. I have read this story over half a dozen times over the years, and it still holds up well.Two other stories in which the \"little guy\" emerges triumphant over the forces of bureaucracy are \"Operation Stinky\" and \"Green Thumb\". The first is the one in which the little skunklike alien tricks the Air Force brass. The second involves a county agent who investigates unusual holes and soil samples appearing in his territory-- and forms an alliance with some alien plants. (There is a dog in this story, too.) \"Idiot's Crusade\" is still another tale in which the little guy wins. But this time, the results are horrific rather than comic.Four stories-- \"Honorable Opponent,\" \"Founding Father,\" \"Jackpot,\" and \"Lulu\"-- involve humans who go out into space and run into some strange situations Out There. The first story is about the Army brass who must meet the teddybearlike aliens who have whipped them in battle to discuss terms of surrender. The second tale is about delusions planted in the mind of a spaceman that begin to take over his life. The third is about a spaceship crew (not, shall we say, like that of the _Enterprise_) that discovers that it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive. And the fourth is about the lovesick ship's computer with a taste for soppy poetry.Three stories in which Earthmen make alien contacts that are not to their advantage are \"Dusty Zebra,\" \"Carbon Copy,\" and \"Neighbor\". The first is about a boy who finds a way to trade with denizens of a parallel word and about his father, who is too clever for his own good. The second dramatizes a real estate scam that backfires on the agent. The third (_another_ story with a dog!) is about the alien who literally has a way to keep people down on the farm. This story is marvelously told, but it always bothered me a bit. It describes what amounts to a benevolent dictatorship.\"Death Scene\" is the most unusual tale in the book. Suppose that everybody could see exactly twenty-four hours into the future. The story is about an elderly man who _knows_ that he will shortly die-- and how he and his family quietly prepare for the event. The tale is so beautifully told, it seems almost petty to point out the flaw in the story: Not everyone will die quietly, painlessly, peacefully, or in dignity.Simak has often (and accurately) been called an author of pastoral science fiction. \"Neighbor\" is the purest pastoral piece in the book, since it deals with a spot of country isolated from the rest of the world. But there is a \"small town\" feel to many of the other stories as well. Aliens in these stories may be a bit strange, but they are usually benevolent-- just plain folks. Simak's world is a world in which many problems can be solved by dickering, playing chess, going fishing, or swapping drinks from a bottle. It's a world that I enjoyed visiting. I suspect that you will like it as well.",

Dog Company is the phonetic alphabet designation for D Company that was used by the U.S. armed forces in World War II and Korea. Dog Company Six is the kind of book that many will want to read at least twice because it's so good. It's a novel about Marines in combat written by a Marine combat veteran. The prose is spare and to the point. The combat scenes are realistic and exciting. The book begins with an inexperienced infantry captain struggling with fears and doubts about his ability to lead Dog Company into war in Korea. As Dog Company fights its way through the Inchon Invasion, the battle for Seoul and the Chosin Reservoir - some of the most honored and storied battles in U.S. Marine Corps history - the commander matures into a tough, capable and brave captain of Marines. Author Edwin Howard Simmons is a retired Marine brigadier general who also fought his way up and the down the Korean peninsula in the same battles. His dialog is true to the Corps and his combat scenes have the realism that only a man who's been there can write. Dog Company Six isn't just a book about war and killing. It's about bravery, sacrifice and dedication to duty. Dog Company Six isn't just a book for and about Marines. It's an entertaining story, well told and deserving to be read by a wide audience.",

                "review/text": "In recent years, the trials and sacrifices of World War II and Vietnam veterans has been brought to the attention of the public by huge movie productions and media hype. However, the story of the American soldier in the \"Forgotten War\" in Korea largely remains to be told. Simmons' book tells this story with the authority of a retired Marine General, the accuracy of the director of the Marine Corps Historical Center, and the passion of a front-line infantryman. Given the media attention this book deserves, it could easily fill the gap in the American consciousness regarding the Korean War, and give the men who fought there their long delayed due.In _Dog Company Six_, Simmons expertly combines realistic accounts of combat, an engaging character study of an everyman Marine officer, and sneaks in the `big picture' view of the operational and political climate in Korea. While the combat is harrowing and the historical account is instructive, I felt one of the most interesting and overlooked aspects of the book was the character study of the Dog Company Six (Six meaning Commanding Officer in Marine lingo), Captain Bayard. Simmons shows where Bayard came from, where he grew up, how he came to be a Marine. He develops Bayard's career from a bit role in World War Two, through time in the Reserves, back to an active duty role with connections in Washington D.C.. In doing so, Simmons gives a real feel for where the citizen soldier comes from - Bayard could easily be the reader, the reader's father, Grandfather, the neighbor next door. The character evolves before the reader, giving a real sense of how war can change the individual.Standing on its own merits, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. However, if you really want to get the most out of this book, a superb adjunct would be the first few chapters of _First to Fight_ by Victor H. Krulak. _First to Fight's_ opening chapters concisely provide a first hand account of the struggle for survival of the Marine Corps in the post World War II force reductions amid the attitude that \"...the era of amphibious warfare is over...\", and the later affirmation of the Marine Corps' role with the amphibious landing at Inchon. Krulak illustrates that the Corps mobilized for Korea with a speed and expertise that no one else could match, in a logistical feat that is still mind boggling today.Finally, to the Chosin Few, and all Korean War veterans...Thanks.",

Here we glimpse the down-to-earth way to genuinely practical insight and solid happiness. This is just the sort of book I've always loved reading: an intimate, friendly, and honest voice telling me about fascinating things that I want to understand better. It's easy to see why Mz. O'Shaughnessy is so \"in demand\" as a reiki master, teacher, and guide. This book is like a good talk with an old friend. Afterwards one feels wiser, more secure, happier. Thank you, Maureen, for fearlessly sharing your story. You assure us that you are \"just like us\" and yet reveal yourself to be an authentic \"master.\" You show us that we are pretty amazing beings, and then invite us to become. . . even more!

It is thought provoking as well as an inspiration to be the best person you can be -- while never asking for perfectionism or that anyone be anything other than her authentic self.Maureen's stories are entertaining, open, honest, and real. There is no pretense or posturing, just an open-hearted sharing of the human condition and some of the challenges we face. The stories are short, so it is a book you can read straight through or a little at a time. Or you can do what I did and read straight through and then go back and read them one at a time. It's a book that I'll read many times over -- each time I pick up something that I hadn't seen before. Some of the ideas I want to keep coming back to and exploring.It's a lovely book -- I hope you enjoy it!",

So much of our adult lives feel out of controll and we need every day heroes to help us understand we can all get &quot;through it.&quot;I look forward to the next book by this author and plan to read others.

If a book is over 150 pages, it must have something about it to hold my attention.. Stressed is Desserts spelled backwards is a book that you don't want to end. It's one of the rare books that I'm able to read in one sitting, and at the same time go back and read parts of it again and again. Different stories and antecdotes within this book resonate within a person at different phases in his or her life and it's so easy to relate to the truths the author speaks of with times in your life or the lives of loved ones. I love to travel and explore the world, and as I do so I also explore the inner depths from within.....

I applaud Dr. Searward for revealing a personal side of stress in what I believe is an effort to heal many through the exposure of one's struggles in life and the resultant successes. I am reminded of Lance Armstrong as I get caught up in my self-created daily worries. Attitude is everything and Dr. Seaward certainly shows that with the right attitude, the blessing in every situation will be revealed. I have also read &quot;Stand Like Mountain, Flow Like Water&quot; and feel that this book is excellent follow-on reading. I think that this book helps remind us of the big picture of life, and will hopefully help many people get out the petty details that fritter life away and open our hearts.",
