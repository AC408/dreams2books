        "description": "The human race has reached a Time of Choosing. Our options are being placed before us by the tide of events -- and by those who are creating them. We can either move forward, building together at last a new world of peace and harmony based on new beliefs about God and Life, or move backward, separately and continuously reconstructing the old world of conflict and discord. The New Revelations provides us with the tools to move forward, to pull ourselves out of despair, lifting the whole human race to a new expression of its grandest vision. In this book, which offers possible and powerful answers to the questions facing the world, bestselling author Neale Donald Walsch urges us to open our hearts and minds to what may be one of the most important spiritual statements of our time. A conversation with God that began as a simple plea from one human being to the God of his understanding, The New Revelations is a life-altering book, given to us when we need it most.",

                "review/text": "I loved Conversations with God books 1, 2, and 3. I have done a ton of reading and I've never found such a broad, advanced, and relatively accessible cosmology. Neale's last book, Communion with God, is a philosophical masterpiece that explains our confused world at its deepest levels. I've read a lot of philosophy, metaphysics and theological books. The Conversation with God books contain some of the purest truths you can find anywhere and this new book is every bit as good as the others.In The New Revelations, Neale and God continue to deliver amazingly valuable insights. This book is the most practical and the most challenging of the Conversatons with God series. It asks us to act, to become spiritual activists, to help change the world, and potentially to save it.God says that the difficulties we are experiencing with our world right now are not simply political, or religious. Our fundamental beliefs are out of wack. God is diligently non-judgemental here and asks us to drop the concept of right and wrong. Righteousness is part of the problem. God asks us to look at things pragmatically. Instead of my beliefs being right, and your's being wrong, God suggests that we simply look at the results we're getting compared to the results we want.I just returned from a weekend seminar with Neale at the Omega Institute in NY state which centered on the messages in this book. Neale asked us to become Spiritual Activists, to help others to examine their beliefs. He wants you to post the 9 New Revelations and the 5 Steps to Peace everywhere, like a modern day Martin Luther - challenge the status quo.There is no question, this is DEFINITELY great stuff. If we all do as it suggests, it WILL change the world for the better.The only problem I have is that Neale plays dumb and hands God a lot of questions that are obviously setups. Neale is much more advanced than he pretends to be here. I suppose he does this to make the material more accessible to a wider range of readers but I know he's more advanced than that. The philosophical side of me wishes Neale would raise the level of the dialog, but I'm sure that would make this less interesting to the average potential reader.",

If you're willing to accept the premise of the series -- that the author is channeling the voice of God and transcribing the conversation -- then you'll appreciate the significance of the fact that the premise of this book is that organized religion is the source of almost all the world's problems.I've read the entire Conversations series, and found all the books to be moving, fresh and thought-provoking. This one is unique in its decisive and specific relevance to current events, and I mean very current events, i.e. the war in Iraq, the Israel-Palestine conflict, American tension between the liberal left and the religious right, questions about abortion, the rights of women, etc., etc.What is consistent with the other books is the incredible wisdom, compassion, good humor and pure love that glow on the pages, even while delivering such a controversial message.

Actually, his books have validated truths I knew inside myself about spirituality and opened my mind to many new insights. I like to re-listen to books 1-3 on audiotape once or twice a year to refresh myself with them.My only complaint with this book is that there is very little new \"stuff\" in it - everything is a repeat from his earlier books, which in and of itself isn't so bad, but what bothers me with this book is that Neale \"plays dumb\" with God and acts like these are all new concepts when in fact, he's already discussed these subjects at length in the previous books. So it doesn't have that \"genuine\" feel that the previous books have and it feels a little fake. Not to say that the points he is making are not incredibly important - I just don't really like the fact that he is playing like it's all new information to him.But for people who have not already read the earlier volumes, this book will not be a disappointment.",

                "review/text": "In his book Freedom from the Known, Krishnamurti writes, \"For centuries we have been spoon-fed by our teachers, by our authorities, by our books, our saints. We say, 'Tell me all about it-what lies beyond the hills and the mountains and the earth?' and we are satisfied with their descriptions, which means that we live on words and our life is shallow and empty. We are second-hand people.\" One of the things I think is so wonderful about this book is that it offers a place to start while still emphasizing and offering a way to discover the truth for ourselves; it is a signpost to truth. Do not overlook this, especially if you have read other CWG books and find yourself saying, \"I have heard all this 'God is communicating with everyone all the time' stuff before.\" This book repeats a lot of the material presented in earlier CWG books, and although some points are simply reiterated, plain and simple, others are made more accessible, and the last few chapters really get good. The explanation of how to receive God's communication was presented in such a way that I was able to get closer to God than I had been before.If you realize that humanity is facing a crisis right now, the way I see it you have two options: you can say you \"want\" to do something about it but don't have the power, because you can't control everyone else, or you can claim the power to change the world as your own. You can choose not to take responsibility for the environmental destruction and warfare on our planet, or you can see the plight of the world as your own, and act on the enormous opportunity there is right now to change the entire course of history by becoming the \"first domino\" in your circle of influence. Yet do not do it because you are afraid of death (life never ends) but because you love life. If you are willing to step up to this task, know that lasting change cannot be achieved on the level of behavior alone; you must change many of your beliefs. Do not wait on this: your mind will ALWAYS need more time, but your soul screams, \"NOW!\" Do not forget who you are.",

Listening to the quotes from many of the worlds great books of spiritual law exposed to me how ubiquitous these misguided messages are accross all cultures and what a huge challenge the charge to\" change beliefs to change the world\" is going to be. The book, as all of the CWG series has, inspired me to show the world to themselves, one person at a time, so that they may see themselves as they have been, a faithful part of the cause of world turmoil, rather than a source of peace, acceptance, and oneness. Read it, discuss it, and be it. Give it to the most obstinent bible-beater or nationalist you know and ask them to defend their philosophy of \" our way or no way\" after reading this book.

And I for one still benefit hugely from the SANITY AND CLARITY of this writing, especially after September 11th.After so many books in the Conversations With God series, thoughts of &quot;re-hash for a bit more money in the bank&quot; almost inevitably cross one's mind, but this is inappropriate and unnecessarily cynical. Yes the message is always basically the same, but as I am a big big fan of all the books I am completely biased in their favour!In The New Revelations the dialogue with God revolves around the crisis of humanity on Earth today, with the underlying main theme being that a spiritual crisis is the fundamental cause of our individual and collective problems. God and Neale suggest that our deepest beliefs must be changed before our behaviour can change. Organized religion takes a bit of a hammering here, although as always in the CWG books there is an embracing of the best of traditional religion while suggesting some fundamental shifts that need to be made if humanity is to survive and prosper.Virtually all the Big Religious Books (Bible, Qur'an etc.) are quoted to demonstrate how man has created God in his own image, a creation which is then used to justify condemning or killing others who hold different beliefs to one's own.",

Contrary to one critic below, it is NOT simply a re-working of Hinduism. All time-honored religious traditions have a nondual school. Though the beliefs of Advaita Vedanta (which is a branch of Hinduism), Taoism and Buddhism all describe a nondual Divine, so does Jesus, particularly in the Gospel of Thomas. What does nondual mysticism say? God is all there is, and you are That. Hence, you and God are &quot;not-two&quot; (nondual). You (and every other sentient being) are Divine Awareness watching phenomenon made of that Awareness. Now, of course, this brings up a lot of questions. Why don't I realize that I am God? If we are all God, why do we do bad things. Why does God bother to manifest as myself and the world?

                "review/text": "Metaphysics, 9/04/04(wferg@sbcglobal.net)RESPONSE: THE NEW REV. - WALSH, A BRIGHT REFLECTIONIn this writing, Walsh offers a grand vision to better the attitude of the world and our lives, to solve our problems, and presents helpful ideas on how people can do this. Overall there exists far too many exceptionally good points about human belief about God and our existence to adequately here mention in this response- obviously, I can only outline my personal overview. According to Walsch, many are mistaken; God does not want our worship, obedience, or service (contradicting everything I ever learned in Sunday school!). He sees the world's purpose as providing \"a contextual field within which you may achieve an awareness of your own divinity (85) \". As far as what or who God truly is, according to Walsch, \"God\" and \"Life\" are simply different names for the same energy. \"Life is God, physicalized\", just as our brain is actually the mind, physicalized. And this unseen, universal energy- to Walsch- comprises everything: is within us, and is us- there is only one energy force that is \"an intrinsic and intimate part\" of every one of us , meaning- in practical terms- that whatever is good for another is good for you, or bad, or harmful, and so on...(which, if everyone believed this there would be no problems, because Why would we want to hurt ourselves?). Walsch presents this reality as being all One- \"One with God and One with each other\". One of the most important teachings Walsch presents: All behaviors are created by belief (just as the entirety of our thought is based upon what we believe to be true). False belief. Walsch presents \"Five Fallacies About God\" that \"create crisis, violence, killing, and war\", which I do not necessarily accept as divine Truth \"sent down from above\", but these fallacies I do find to be outstandingly valid, and wish that everyone took this to heart. Some of this book accompanies mention of the radical Muslims, living in the Middle East, who have declared war on Western civilization, declaring \"death to America\" and \"death to Israel\"- among other specified enemies. These false beliefs of these radical Muslims about this Life and about God are directly the cause of their evil intentions, and Walsch explains this human belief very well. The cause of all of our problems of the world are rooted in our beliefs- (our mental acceptance of thoughts)- our false beliefs about this world and about other people. This is true, no matter what you believe. Walsch explains that humans have \"stitched together in our world a complex interweaving of spiritual, philosophical, political, and economic concepts that pretty much govern our collective experience(214)\", and that these are based upon our beliefs, and mental constructions- \"ideas about 'how things are\"- such as our concept of morality (based upon our beliefs) and when these are false, what are we doing? Our most damaging behaviors are based upon these mental constructions, Walsch writes, which are based upon our beliefs- making them what to change if humans want to solve our problems we attribute to the incorrect causes. Mental Constructions. He explains the reasoning behind, for example, the violence in the Middle East; that people are being killed over belief of the way \"things should be\"; mental constructions called morals not-shifting (for thousands of years!) This is a problem! Walsch makes good point, after insightful explanation, after valuable analysis- about this God I think I have partially known my entire life- minus all the unwelcome, \"scary\" aspects. Walsch offers an improved concept that is comfortable for me to nurse within my knowing, which generates my skepticism- what I think I wish to be true, but is what I do now not honestly expect is likely. But, and however, this \"higher Truth\" I do not concretely know. And seek to, but, really: Who am I? Who are we? Who is every single person?Personally, I interpret & accept Walsch's point of view as exceptionally insightful and essentially good and very, very well thought-through. Since this author's also written about 20 other books founded upon the same \"divine communion\" with God, he apparently has a lot to say about the world and the seemingly meaningful things that \"God\" is saying to us, which do seem quite good. Walsch is not \"off his rocker\", for he seems- to me- to be a completely logical mind with a sound, confident point-of-view, although, does bravely wear such a testimony he knows is to always attract many skeptics, yet many devout supporters of these beliefs, of course. Because Walsch portrays such an optimistic picture for \"God's Overall Plan\" of our human existence, to accept his non-demonizing \"purpose of the world\", what, and who this popularly conceived God of his truly does exist, an uneasy skeptic- I think- would conclude that a reader of such a book is only intentionally accomplishing the satisfaction of their own mind- easing their worries, icing their issues. I do not see it as this, but as just another man's view on this highly elaborate and complex, confusing world in which we live. I am surely far from any satisfying level of understanding, and will dive towards any more understanding that I can get. The world's purpose that Walsch presents, that we are all out to \"achieve our own divinity\", to me- makes a lot of sense, because I honestly do see \"God\" within each of us, within our every flicker of thought and action and movement, I see \"God\" in all moments of our being, every comprehension of our minds evolution, progressively slow- so minute that we do not even notice. I'm just not positive of what this means; for myself, for human beings; I search. The comprehensive canvas that Walsch paints is attractive, but yes, makes this great logical sense notable. Personally, I am in the process of the intellectual motion, partway through completion of \"knowing God\" or \"knowing myself\", which can basically be acknowledged as the same thing. Walsch's insight concerning human \"False Beliefs\" is what I maybe consider the most outstandingly impressive components of this book, although there are many. The in-depth reasoning he provides for all of human beings \"being\"- that all our behaviors are created by beliefs- which provides the foundation of our very frame of thought. Yet, all of our beliefs by a multitude of other various factors of the the lives we lead- making the origin of ALL human problems tracing back to our beliefs- (what we think is confirmed to be true)- yet when magnified to the cause of the main cause, existing in our minds (our beliefs), this analysis of our own reasoning seems to become a bit more complex, which I am still in the fortunate process of understanding. To conclude this response of Neale Donald Walsch's \"The New Revelations, A Conversation with God\", I re-iterate my impressive reaction to a book of greatly good ideas by a man I had previously not even known of- but, then again, I am reminded everyday how little it is I know (relatively speaking) about everything in this world and enormous universe, as a tiny, finite human being. Constantly boggling my feeble mind on how there can realistically even exist a God, a Great Reason for us and all of this. Still, when myself and my individual opportunity is compared with the terrible injustice and misery and ugliness of this world at-large- both right now and through-out history- realistically it seems as if the explanation is far too overwhelming for the human mind to handle. Yet, I crave to know. So what am I to do but do the best I know I can, with what it is that I now exist?",

        "description": "A paradigm-shifting blend of science, religion, and philosophy for the agnostic, spiritual-but-not-religious, and scientifically minded reader Many people are fed up with the way traditional religion alienates them, perpetuates conflict, vilifies science, and undermines reason. Nancy Abrams-a philosopher of science, lawyer, and lifelong atheist-is among them, but she has also found freedom in imagining a higher power. In A God That Could Be Real, Abrams explores a radically new way of thinking about God. She dismantles several common assumptions about God and shows why an omniscient, omnipotent God that created the universe and plans what happens is incompatible with science-but that this doesn't preclude a God that can comfort and empower us. Moving away from traditional arguments for God, Abrams finds something worthy of the name \"God\" in the new science of emergence: just as a complex ant hill emerges from the collective behavior of individually clueless ants, and just as the global economy emerges from the interactions of billions of individuals' choices, God, she argues, is an \"emergent phenomenon\" that arises from the staggering complexity of humanity's collective aspirations and is in dialogue with every individual. This God did not create the universe-it created the meaning of the universe. It's not universal-it's planetary. It can't change the world, but it helps us change the world. A God that could be real, Abrams shows us, is what humanity needs to inspire us to collectively cooperate to protect our warming planet and create a long-term civilization.",

                "review/text": "God and the Universe by Arthur Gibson (Routledge) combines incisive interpretations of the latest scientific theories of the origins of the universe with an unparalleled understanding of their religious and philosophical implications. In tackling head-on the highly charged issue of God's relevance to contemporary cosmology, the breadth of Gibson's perspective on his subject matter is amazing: from virtual reality to the meaning of life and from Aristotle to Stephen Hawking. Books like this do not come along very often. I suggest one take a couple of mornings off and read through it. God and the Universe will provide some important novel perspectives about how things can mean from the smallest to the largest and how perhaps best to go about learning more. God and the Universe is a preliminary exploration to suggest strategies to discover ways out of this impasse, conceived as the first of a series of books. It displays many limitations: does the book cover too much ground and too many subjects? Gibson does not engage with Hegel, and is content only occasionally to treat Kant. The book addresses Aristotle's Poetics, rather than, as one might expect, his Metaphysics, and instead attempts to construct metaphysical problems out of our contemporary astrophysics, without introducing the significance of the reception of Aristotle's thinking into Christian theology. But, however one assesses, for example, Kant's contribution to `faith and reason' and `God's relation to the world' debates, the effect of systematically commenting upon Kant's great opus, or other seminal authors, is to be regulated by the controlling notions of relevance and commentary to which they subject us, and to which they have been subjected. This is not a whim by which one denounces or discards such authors, but to attempt, however imperfectly, to stand as far as is possible independently of these histories of influence and to think afresh. Yet to ignore them is both impossible and to delight in alienation. Gibson has tried to produce a different sort of use and this avoidance of authorities. The learning is staggering and can leave one wondering what are Gibson's premises. Still this read is pure adventure that many will find plenty to think about, even if the details eventually take us in different directions.It's an important read.",

The trouble lies with the author's allusive, non-linear style, where rigour and clarity are needed. His writing style is so jumbled that it is impossible to tell what, if anything, he is getting at. The range of material he refers to is unmanageably vast, but he is a long way from being in control of it. Surprising connections are made, but he seems unable to think clearly about them. The result is pretentious and bizarre.I note that the &quot;blurb&quot; on the dust-jacket makes no attempt to summarize what the book is saying, neither do the prestigious people who have provided endorsements. I suspect that neither they nor the publishers could follow the book any better than I could. There may be short-term puzzlement about how Routledge came to publish such an unsatisfactory manuscript but, beyond that, it will surely sink without trace.With such an incomprehensible book, it is hard for a reviewer to begin to indicate what it is about, but one central idea seems to be that of &quot;live metaphor&quot;. There is no clear definition of the concept, but Gibson seems to be suggesting that much discourse in both cosmology and theology consists of &quot;live metaphors&quot;. There are indeed interesting issues about how these two disciplines are radically metaphorical in similar but non-identical ways. That, I suspect, is the issue that the author was trying to write about, but it can't be clarified by a book of this kind. I certainly cannot recommend it. - Fraser Watts, University of Cambridge",

The basic concept here is that God governs the human race by allowing people to do as they wish. It reminds me of the saying 'He governs best who governs least.' Therefore God governs in a way that is basically invisible, and yet He still governs.According to this book God maintains 'control' in myriads of subtle ways, and yet the system is set up in such a way that people really are free. That is, people can acknowledge or not acknowledge God, they can obey or disobey Him, they can think and do as they wish. I think this is a pretty good explanation of the existence of evil. It exists in potential as an opposite of God, dictated by the principle of freedom - but not created by God. I thought this was brilliant. It explains why bad things happen to good people, at least it does to me. That is, bad things are not caused by God but by the principle of freedom itself.The best part of this book, however, is its articulation of the means God uses so that bad things will stop happening to good people. According to Swedenborg, God is guiding the human race in subtle and miraculous ways towards a happier future. It happens slowly and invisibly so as not to impinge on human freedom. The principle method is information. As people gather knowledge, the knowledge eventually has a great impact on how they act. Knowledge of God is called the Word of God, and it very gradually shapes human actions - but only insofar as people understand, accept, and willingly act on it. I find it easy to believe that information is that powerful.The purpose of all of this, according to this book, is to bring people to happiness, both in this world and after death in heaven forever. Not a bad purpose.A work of genius. I would call it Divinely inspired.",

As such, God has no needs except for us to be.WHAT GOD WANTS truly expresses the core belief of all Christians and other religions; that God is a god of love. Walsch presents a God that is familiar to all of us in our souls. A God we all know exists, but tend to forget in our actions. What man/woman needs is to let go of fear and embrace this experience of a God of love.Many of us who were brought up to see God as this \"loving\" yet punishing Father figure will have a hard time accepting a God who loves us no matter who or what we are. As the author points out, an omnipotent God, who is all loving, needs nothing from his/her creations. This is a very difficult idea for those who support fear based religions to hear.This book is a must read for any true seeker of inner wisdom and spiritual insight!

Human beings have always been free. They simply have not known it.\" -Neale Donald WalschSo, when was the last time you read a dangerous book?Hang on to your seats, because author Neale Donald Walsch challenges the sacred cows of every major world religion by daring to examine what God (truly) wants. An equal opportunity offender, his singular, simple answer to the question \"What does God want?\" will surprise most, offend the inert close-minded, and thrill those who are already (all ready!) riding the wave of New Spirituality.Walsch, the author of the New York Times Bestselling Conversations with God series, explores two basic questions in his book What God Wants - A Compelling Answer to Humanity's Biggest Question:1. Who and What is God?2. What does God want, and why?Declaring that fear and guilt are the real enemies of humanity (and differentiating them from caution and remorse) Walsh traces war, world hunger, violence, sexism, racism and more directly to humanity's belief about God and what He wants.On June 23, 2004, the fascinating results of a scientific survey conducted by Harris Interactive hit the wire services: 69% of adult Americans believe religious differences are the biggest hurdle to global peace. This overwhelming percentage is evidence that individuals are starting to wake up and realize that humanity's beliefs about God and what He wants is THE biggest problem in the world today.For many nations, entire social and judicial structures are built upon beliefs about various interpretations of sacred scriptures. The major religions, without exception, advocate an \"us versus them\" Separation Theology. In the 19th century, Americans sincerely accepted the biblical story of Noah's son Ham to justify slavery. In that time, to raise one's voice in protest to enslavement would have been met with persecution, accusations of heresy, and possibly death.Yet, even now, many followers of religions such as Islam, Christianity, and Judaism justify discrimination, superiority (\"specialness\"), indifference, hatred, and violence based on what the \"sacred scriptures\" say. At the risk of being labeled an infidel, subversive, or \"lost sinner\", Walsch sounds a clarion call that NOW is the time to ruthlessly examine what humanity believes about God, and what Deity wants from humanity.Walsch asserts:\"When it comes to its most sacred beliefs, our society will not tolerate new ideas that violate doctrine-or even question it. Thus, we are trying to build a twenty-first-century reality with first-century moral, ethical, and spiritual tools. This would be akin to a surgeon stepping into a modern-day operating room with a very sharp stone. It is not necessary to build our tomorrows with such primitive tools. The prohibition against new ideas and new thoughts about God can and must be lifted. A new discussion about God and What God Wants must begin.\"Fortunately for humanity, Walsch (and Atria Books) had the courage to open the discussion by asking difficult questions, presenting the global consequences of centuries of religious assumptions, and offering a compellingly simple solution to mankind's greatest challenges. Walsch examines ideas on morality, suffering, free will, death, male and female, money, sex, and so on through the lens of Separation Theology (which is what we've had up until now), and how those same ideas look through the lens of Unity Theology.While humanity is in some deep do-do right now, the good news is that we can choose TODAY to make different choices-including how we choose to see God, life, and our fellow man.Indeed, our very lives-and the life of the planet-may depend on it.As Walsch succinctly puts it: \"We human beings do not need to be saved from the `snares of the Devil', we need to be saved from ourselves. We are threatening to condemn ourselves to Hell right here on earth. We can yet create Heaven on earth, but we must choose now very wisely...That new understanding can launch the Thousand Years of Peace of which it has been written. It can give birth to a Golden Age of Glory.\"Amen and Amen.Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)",

                "review/text": "I must say I'm a little saddened that the majority of bad reviews come from devout Christians, whose calls to \"read the Bible instead!\" might form a justification for this book's self-aggrandising assertion that it is \"a dangerous book\".I can scarcely believe anybody actually bought the book after reading the opening chapter, which I quote here in full: \"Very few people will be able to believe what's in this book. At least, at first. That may make it one of the most unbelievable books of all time.\" I mean, seriously? This is how you're going to start? Who carries on reading a book which starts with such a patently nonsensical statement?Chapter 2 is not much longer, and winds up as follows: \"Such ideas, if accepted and adopted, will produce dramatically different ways of living and being. Values will change. Priorities will change. Power structures and power *holders* will change. Some of those power holders do not want any of this to happen. That may make this not only one of the most unbelievable books of all time, but also one of the most dangerous.\"And there you have it. Never mind \"Das Kapital\", \"The Communist Manifesto\" or \"Mein Kampf\", it's \"What God Wants\" that is truly a dangerous book! After all, it says so itself!Having quickly browsed the book, I discovered very quickly the answer to Walsch's question. Apparently what God wants is \"Nothing\", based, apparently, on the notion that an omniscient, omnipresent God can literally \"want\" for nothing, since He already *has* everything. That's fine, but then what? Turning to near the end, there was a sub-heading \"Morality\", which began (from memory) - \"Morality won't change, because God wants nothing.\" When I lost my faith in God and became an atheist, I had to think about and derive my own moral code, based on certain basic humanity-based precepts. But that whole question as to what defines morality in a Godless (or as Walsch puts it, \"a Wantless God\") Universe, deserves a little more exploration and consideration than half a page almost written as an afterthought.The thesis of the book seems clear enough - all that's required is for the entire six billion population of the Earth to think the way Neale Walsch does, about Life, about God, about each other, and yadayadayada. This may surprise Neale Walsch, but the vast majority of people actually do behave as if God doesn't want anything from them, and I don't mean that in a bad or cynical way: most of us give our fellow human beings a certain amount of priority and consideration, as opposed to pursuing a single-minded trip to Heaven. But there are always those extremists - on all sides of the religious spectrum, and on the political. So what Walsch is pretty much suggesting is, \"Abolish extremism!\" All we have to do is sit down with Osama Bin Laden and Benjamin Netanyahu, give them \"What God Wants\" and see them embrace each other, crying \"What have we been doing? God doesn't want anything! Here, have Palestine back, God never wanted us to live there in the first place!\" \"No, no, keep it! I insist! Turns out I was wrong - God didn't want me to blow up the twin towers\"The writing style is somewhat hectoring, like being cornered by a bore at a party: \"What does God want? Nothing ... Even if you disagree with this vehemently, think about it ... What makes you disagree? Who told you this statement could not be true? What makes *them* right? ... Because they read it in a book? But then, what makes the book right?\" You can practically feel Walsch's finger pounding into your chest. And note the hubris of dismissing a book ... in a book!Ultimately, it is amazing to me that someone can express such baseless pretensions to philosophical and theological importance, in a seventh-grade writing style, and actually get published, let alone sell the substantial numbers it undoubtedly has. Ironically, one good thing the book might encourage people to do is to think more skeptically, but if everybody did that, Neale Donald Walsch wouldn't have sold Copy One, let alone fifteen books of vapid claptrap.",

This book, however, is very clearly the words of Neale. He is angry. He is frustrated. He has unfairly lumped every single religion as trash and worthless. In Buddhism, it is against their religion to harm even a fly (literally) but he lists them as one of the religions that have caused people to mass murder in the name of God. Neale, have you even studied the religions you are bashing? Then just when I think his ignorance and ego could get no bigger I read \"This could well be the most important information ever placed before the human race.\" How very, very ironic that Neale criticizes a religion with a Savior yet then declares himself to be the Savior of the human race with what he is about to reveal to us. He repeatedly criticizes the worlds religions for claiming that only they have the truth and then declares that what he says is truth and that they are all wrong. He does exactly what he is criticizing. All the while he is complaining of a separatist religion and then he actually creates what he is complaining about! Does Neale want a world where we can all appreciate and learn from our religious differences or does he want a world where we all believe what Neale believes? And with every book after the CwG series I am constantly reminding myself that in the very first book God said there would be 3 books. So why is this Neale's 15th?",

Ramtha's unlimited knowledge and genius gives each individual the tools and knowledge to be great, to reclaim their lost and forgotten divinity and to understand God from a personal and scientific level, giving hope for a noble, adventurous and joyfilled life.

What God wants is basically a short and easily accessible summary version of his prior work, and probably a good introduction for those who haven't read Walsch yet, and an excellent choice for those who don't like thick books. For the fans of Walsch's writings like me: it nicely completes the collection, but it doesn't really add anything!The other thing is that this one does not dwell on the \"big\" universal metaphysical questions, which is what I liked about the others: it is, I think, mostly targeted at the many people who have faith in one of the main monotheist religions (Christians, Jews and Muslims - I guess Conservative American Christians are his primary focus), of which I am and was not.So, I would still recommend the Conversations with God, Communion with God, or Tomorrow's God, over this one, for the essence of Walsch's incredible message and their more universal appeal. I would recommend this one to offer as a gift to people you know who have faith in one of the big monotheist religions and are starting to examine their faith.It is of course legitimate that Walsch now wants to spread his message as widely as possible, so I guess he will be experimenting with different writing styles, all at the same time intensifying, like he does here, his call to action to bring about the New Spirituality on earth.",

If you think not, then go back and read it and then read this book again. What Neale has done here is bring us up-to-date several years later from the original experience...it goes to show, the points do not change.I deeply believe that his assertions are correct about our current experience, but my worry is...who is listening? Obviously, 51% of America is not listening, or George Bush would not now be president...and they could care less about who they really are! As for the rest of us...a small minority are listening and willing to do something about it. In his last book, I believe, 2 - 3% of the entire human race is needed to bring about a radical change in the collective conscious. I happen to believe, that with Bush and the Christian Right, who are suffocating the world with their fear and oppressive rhetoric, Neale's message will remain, unheard. I don't believe that humanity has much longer on this earth because the human mind rather then the human heart, is what drives this world.

Nonscientists for the most part, they are not passionately concerned about DNA or radiometric dating. What they are passionate about is the tension they feel between science and their own religious faith. They are wrestling with deeper, existential issues, such as the meaning of life, the explanation of evil, and the existence of God.Paradigms on Pilgrimage is a rarity: a book for people trying to think their way through the conflicting claims of fundamentalism and modern biblical scholarship as well as natural science. It should appeal to, and maybe persuade them, because it is the highly personal story of two former fundamentalists who made that same intellectual and spiritual journey themselves. Together they moved toward a new understanding of God as having created by means of evolution. In sharing their stories, they document the thinking of real people as they moved into and out of the creationist worldview.Along the way, they provide some original, ingenious arguments against creationism and biblical literalism - which are of all the more interest because they were arguments that actually helped change these individuals' minds. In a final section, they also offer an original reading of Genesis 1 with commentary, to show how this creation account presents (and makes good sense as) a nave observational cosmology radically different from our objective scientific one. The authors' argument - that the biblical writers were not and did not claim to be omniscient about the natural world - restores to the biblical text the integrity it loses in the hands of literalists.This enjoyable and stimulating read will give evolutionists insight into the minds of their opponents, and give creationists persuasive reasons to change their minds.

It is however a bit off my usual reading schedule, it is in the genre of personal stories, of transition from young earth creationism (YEC) to something else. I don't usually read personal stories or books with substantial personal involvement, i prefer to spend my time on science and ideas rather than with people's personal struggles. This was an online recommendation that i took seriously and am frankly glad i did. It is not a spectacularly argued book, careful but not with great flashes of insight, more understated and calmly through the years type of analysis. It has as a goal not to discourage people from reading the whole thing, not to push hot buttons and have people just put the book down in disgust and move on. It has a goal of personal involvement and sympathetic identification with the authors as they tell you their journeys in the field, and as such it is very well done. Don't read this for big ideas in the CED debate, for great pieces of refutation you can take to the online boards, it isn't that type of a book. What it is, is a gentle, kindly story of two rather smart and sensitive men studying how their youthful background ought to interact with their adult callings and their studies of both God's World and God's Word over time and with increasing maturity and sensitivity to nuance.I'd recommend this to every YEC, to anyone who struggles with the issues in CED, to anyone who reads Genesis and asks real hard questions. It is designed for this audience, it is very sympathetic to their concerns and sensitivities, and ought not to upset even the most hard boiled YECist. I'd just read it front to back, in order, not because the chapters are in a logical and necessary order requiring this, but because the author's have given some real thought to how important ideas interact and structure the book to be such a journey. It really is best just read as a novel, then go back and highlight and read for detail. Just breeze through the first time for the passion and the pain the authors wish to transfer to the reader as their story of their studies.Outline and pull-quotesIntroduction:\"Many believing Christians have experienced crises of faith, and personal rejections when they have chosen to accept an account of origins that is based on reasoned interpretation of centuries of scientific observation, because this account does not coincide with a literal interpretation of Genesis.\" pg 11\"but this way to a middle position has been made perilous by the bitter polarization between proponents of 'either/or\" positions on both sides.\"\"in its place they have embraced understandings that are more modest, tentative, and nuanced, but ultimately also more satisfying, durable and empowering.\" pg 12\"of how the Bible's moral teaching can be considered reliable when its cosmology and other scientific claims must be recognized as derived from a primitive, observational perspective.\"\"after demonstrating that this account's cosmology is indeed phenomenological(it describes how things appear, rather than how they actually are), the authors explore the implications\"pg 14\"This occurs when people who are not familiar with the Bible mistakening equate creationist claims, which are ultimately untenable with the Bible's actual teachings.\" pg 16\"Although it felt as if they were abandoning their faith, as a step of faith they began to trust the fruits of the vocations to which God had called them, rather than the dogmatic pronouncements that had always provided such security up to that point.

I was raised in an evangelical Christain home. We considered the concept of evolution a rival to the Bible's explanation of the origins of biological diversity. We equated it with man's attempt to deny the existence of God.\"\"evolution proclaimed an \"ateleology,\" or absence of inherent purpose in the created world. Therefore, by implication and overt affirmation, anyone who espoused a belief in evolution necessarily had abandoned belief in the existence of God and had a strictly naturalistic and mechanistic view of the universe.\"\"The appeal of evolutionary theory to the atheist, we were taught, lay in its apparent ability to absolve man of his moral responsibility to an almight God who had created all that there is.\" pg 23\"my trust in the Bible as a book of divine origin hinged at that time upon the expectation that when it spoke on matters relating to science, its statements would be accurate by today's standards, rather than reflecting the observational perspective of the culture in which it was composed. Establishing objective scientific accuracy in a book from ancient times would prove that the author had been given some supernatural or divine insight with the natural realm, and this would be a sign to indicate that when the Bible spoke on matters relating to morality, it drew on the same supernatural, authoritative source.\" pg 31-2Chapter 2: Those fossilized footprints in kansas\"It would be difficult for me to overstate the impact these simple fossilized fooprint impressions had upon me. In retrospect, I don't think anything else I have ever seen has so profoundly changed my life.\" pg 39\"Many years later, as I read more widely on the history of the development of geology, I discovered that some nineteenth-century geologists had suggested that the Flood had been a quiet one, leaving no significant geological effects. They had been pushed to suggest this alternative in an attempt to preserve the historical reality of the story, while admitting that they were unable to identify global effects of Noah's Flood. Having never seen this alternative suggested in any creationist literature, I was impressed with the ingenuity of these nineteenth-century geologists.\" pg 43\"Once i entertained the notion that the earth migh be old, I had to call into question all the rest of the 'scientific creationist' paradigm. Why? Because it was all based on a single lynchpin claim about the age of the earth. ... matters of eternal importance were on the line. After all, the paradigm was based on the explicit statement that the truth of the entire Bible hinged on the scientific accuracy of a literal rendering of the first chapters of Genesis\" pg46\"Footprint fossils spoke to me personally as silent witnesses to the great antiquity of this planet.\" pg 52Chapter 3: same place, different times-or same time, different places?\"any given organism will only be found with certain other organism, and only in certain areas.\" pg 57\"the proof that the answer is 'same place, different times' lies in the observation that the vast majority of fossils are preserved at or very near to where they lived.\" pg 61\"I knew now that in their vast majority different kinds of organisms had lived at different times on earth.\" pg 71Chapter 4: what did it mean to create?\"How many times had God created new kinds of organisms, and when had He done so?\" pg 73\"I would have been content to believe that God had miraculuously created every species instantaneoulsy at different times in the geological past, except that I could not help but notice the lines paleontologists were drawing connecting fossils so as to describe evolutionary lineages.\" pg 74\"Perhaps a created kind could encompass all the species that we currently place within a genus, or even all the species and genera within a taxonomic family. ... So maybe no originally created kind boundaries had been bridged. ... As appealing as this second possibility was, I recognized that to embrace it would be to take another significant step away from my creationist origins.\" pg 79\"it seemingly removed God from being a necessary link in the creative process?\"\"First, there were bridging morphologies between major groups of organisms, such as dinosaurs and birds. Second, it was also true that similar organisms were more likely to occur close together in geologic time than they were to be separated by vast amounts of time.\" pg 81\"I felt as though God as a proximal agent in the creation of life, was being removed from the creative process. This belief was too fundamental a conviction for me to waltz away from without emotional consequences.\" pg 82Chapter 5: atheistic meteorolgoy of divine rain?\"I wondered what part a person of faith should consider God to play in sending rain. Furthermore what part, if not all, of meteorology should we not bother studying, because therein lies the domain of God, a realm beyond scientific study.\"\"for our lack of consistency when it came to biblical interpretation. I realized at that time that we were content to let natural processes account for precipitation, but when it came to the origin of biological diversity, we were adamant that no natural processes could or would ever be found to account for something the Bible attributed to the actions of God.\" pg 84\"If none of these came to us from a close reading of the Bible, but rather from a careful study of nature, then we should reasonably expect to have to study nature at least as closely to learn anything about the mechanisms that generated biological diversity, especially in the light of the fact that the Bible is also silent on the natural mechanisms of evolution.\" pg 85\"So how have Christians reconciled meteorology with the Bible's clear message that God is responsible for the production of rain? \" pg 86\"For me, the question of the origin of biological diversity no longer necessarily carries with it any theological baggage. It is simply a scientific question. Put it another way, the question of orgins is only as theological as the origin of rain.\" pg 88\"it would be intellectually lazy, and unscientific, to claim that it simply must have happened as a result of direct, supernatural intervention by God.\" pg 89Part 2: Creationism and Biblical InterpretationChristopher R. SmithChapter 6: Limericks and Epics\"The result was that the mainline Christian theology I had learned to that point was quickly supplemented by an amalgam of fundamentalist, evangelical, Pentecostal, and charismatic perspectives.\" pg 96\"I continued to approach the Bible in the way typical of the broad movement within which I had come to a personal faith in Christ, as if it could be read meaningfully a verse here and a verse there. ... shaping principle... They were unresolved because because they were unresolvable with the paradigm for biblical interpretation I shared with my Christian community, in which isolated verses or passages were read literally and non-contextually.\" pg 99-100\"Nevertheless, I continued to believe that Genesis 1 was a exact description of the events of the first six days of the physical creation. If I had had to account for light without the sun on the first three days, I would have appealed to some supernatural agency.\" pg 101Chapter 7: Meredith Kline and the \"Framework\" View\"I sat back in awe as he spoke: he was brilliant, and a meticulous scholar, but his deep faith and Christ-like character shone through everything he said and did. This was a rare combination. I felt it set a standard toward which I should aspire.\"\"His theological commitments, strong as they were, were not primary, he was first and foremost a biblical scholar, and he carried out his scholarship specifically through a careful reading of the text.\" pg 106\"The was probably the first time I had seen that if we want to interpret the Bible accurately and credibly, we need to approach it on its own terms, that is, by understanding and respecting the literary conventions according to which it was written.\" pg 108\"what does the Bible say about how God sustained the creation while it was in process? Was this through supernatural agencies, or through natural providence?\" pg 109\"This did not sit well with me, as the premise of supernatural agency was the key to my literal reading.\"\"He first made the case that the opening creation account in Genesis must be considered 'poetry'.\" alliteration, assonance, parallelism pg 110\"There was a amazing depth of meaning I had never appreciated before in the account of the days of creation. This passage was not so much a description of how we got here as an explanation of why we were here. It had a moral purpose, challenging humans to acknowledge God's' supreme lordship, despite their pretensions to self-determination and self-sufficiency.\" pg 111\"to portray Jesus as coming at the beginning of the seventh seven of generations after Abraham, the generation of sabbath or jubilee? pg 112\"that i did not necessarily have to make a stark choice between a creationist paradigm (unscientific but moral) in which people are accountable to God for how they treat others, and an evolutionary one (scientific, but amoral), in which life consists of a ruthless quest for domination.\" pg 114\"We need to witness and participate in the 'Sabbath enthronement of God' as the culmination of creation.\" pg 115-6\"(by non-literal I mean one in which words and phrases are not necessarily descriptions, even figurative ones, of historical events.)\"\"My main point was that the prevailing belief about natural history had changed first, in response to the 'spirit of the age' or Zeitgeist that emphasized 'progress'\". pg 116Chapter 8: was Adam created before or after the animals?\"The only conclusion I could come to was that he did not understand himself to be writing history, contrary to our characteristic expectations of his work. The implications were profound. It was not necessary to struggle to match up the Genesis narratives with the events of natural and human history! Something else was going on in the pages of this inspired ancient book.\" pg122\"The final effect is the portrayal of Jesus as arriving at (indeed, as constituting) the beginning of a time of spiritual rest and renewal in the life of the nation (corresponding to the concepts of 'sabbath' and 'jubilee' in the Old Testament), Genealogy provides the canvas on which this portrait is painted, but what we have before us is clearly closer to art than history.\" pg 123\"the the purpose especially of these early chapters was to explain the brokenness of human existence as the cumulative result of alienation from God.\" pg 125\"how God's crative activity, as described solved a twofold problem ('the earth was without form and void') by making a place for everything and then putting everything in its place.\"\"we are God's stewards and vice-regents, meant to superintend creation, but specifically meant to do this in service to God, in whose sabbath enthronement we must participate.\" pg 126\"Like me, they had always been taught that the source of our confidence in the inspiration and authority of the Bible is that long ago everything really happened just as it describes, because it is speaking from a divine eyewitness perspective. But if a greater familiarity with the text discloses that the Bible is not always making historical statements-indeed, in some places connat be making them-the waht is the source of our confidence in it and especially in its' moral program? Whe not read any other collection of edifying tales, and be guided by their cumulative morality instead?\" pg 128-9\"what is the source of our confidence in the Bible, if it doesn't make amazingly accurate natural scientific statements long before this was humanly possible?\" pg 129\"But the solution, I saw more clearly than ever, was not let any religious or philosophical positions become confused with reasoned descriptions of scientific observations.\" pg 133\"The Bible is written from an observational perspective.\" \"To me, there seems to be a providential purpose in the Bible's observational descriptions: they allow it to travel into every culture as the word of God.\" pg 134\"that the Bible's entire cosmology that is, its description of the universe around us, is consistently observational.\"\"In time I came to be amazed at how pervasive this observational 'cosmology' was in the Bible, but even more so at how indifferent I and others had been to it while at the same time being very concerned about reconciling the Bible's 'cosmogony' or its description of how the universe came to be, with scientific descriptions. Why the double standard? Why did we not bat an eyelash at observational cosmology, but insist on the literal truth of what migh be a similiarly observation cosmogony?\" pg 135-6\"their descriptions must rathe be intended essentially as literal, given the limiations on the observations they and their contemporaries could have made. The biblical authors do not appear to have been granted supernatural insights into the non-apparent facts of cosmology.\" pg 136\"This leaves open the question, of course, of how the biblical writers, if they truly were inspired by God, could have been 'wrong' at least by contemporary scientific standards, as they described how the world came to be.\" pg 138Chapter 9: it says somewehre, 'God rested'\"They all attribute to a supernatural casue(the action of God) results which, the more closely one studies them, appear more and more to have come about through natural process. ...

The authors share their personal yet common struggle in the hope that others on a similar faith and intellectual journey may be helped. This book is born from their individual experiences where the authors face up to real life questions and doubts, using the bible and faith in a way that offers hope for other honest inquirers. This book offers a gentle learning curve for those who are willing to learn - without any hint of antagonism. This book is written from the perspective of a respectful understanding of what is at stake.This book will be of appeal to a broad spectrum of people including academic inquirers and also those, such as parents, who are aware of the contentious issues in the high school science class that their children may face. This book raises questions that many high school and university students will be asking as they encounter the biological and other sciences. Eventually our children need to know where babies come from, this book is a gentle assist to those who are asking questions about life and origins while related to faith. This is an honest journey of faith seeking understanding where faith does not have to be rejected by embracing science. The authors undertake their task with great sensitivity and great respect for both their subject matter and their readers. This book shows how faith can be enlarged by such an unlikely liaison of science and religion.This book would make good preparatory reading for anyone entering a theological seminary. Alternatively, this book would make good reading for those in high school or those embarking on a university course.",

                "review/text": "I've read many books pertaining to our need to change the way we go about doing things if we are to succeed as a species on this planet. Many have outlined the necessary steps that we must make in order to do so and none have done it more succinctly and beautifully as this book from Neale Donald Walsch.Recognizing the duality that exists within us as our ego and our true self, and that the true self is currently overshadowed by the ego, cuts to the very nature of our current world situation and all its attending war, strife and suffering. Only the ego uses tools of fear to try to bring about solutions to all the problems we see. Walsch's book brings this duality to the forefront using a very unique literary vehicle and whether you choose to believe that he actually converses with God is irrelevant. His word's ring so true that if read without blinders and preconceptions they touch our very core, our true selves,love.When we finally realize that all our travails are rooted in ego manifesting our reality we'll know that we aren't separate, but one, and that the belief in separateness is killing us at an ever increasing pace. Our problems are spiritual in nature as expressed through our misguided and misunderstood teachings of our religions. Walsch clearly shows how the dogmatic aspects of those religious beliefs have lead us very close to the brink of our own self destruction. All our religions at their foundation teach that love is the only answer. Unfortunately, misinterpretations of our religions are what the ego uses to have us believe that our's is the only way to salvation, and our way is the only way. Using all aspects of fear it manipulates us to the point that we no longer know who we really are and we cave into the fear. And knowing who we really are will be our only true salvation and it will only come once we embrace fully that love is the only answer. Unless that thought can be fully realized we are doomed to repeating the same pitiful attempts of answering our problems using the tools of fear so readily supplied by our egos.Walsch, or God speaking through him, gives us the basic tools to begin a transformation in our belief structure about who we are and who God is. This will lead to a new world, one based on love, not fear. One based on the knowledge that we all have at our core the one and only thing that can rejoin us as one, love. There are many good books finding there way into our hands giving us the guidance and opportunity we need to proceed into the 21st century successfully. Its up to us to finally say, we've had enough, there's got to be a better way.. I believe that way is outlined clearly in this book. If this book were to be read by everyone, I believe the world would see a profound move towards what we all profess to want, peace and love mainfested between all people. For yourself, your family, the family of man, and the future of the world, get this book and read it and then take action... do it today.",

Each time I think Neale and God have said all there is to say, another set of nuances become present. This is evolution in action!Before Neale's books, I had only found a couple books that *truly* struck a chord in my heart. Then the CWG series struck a chord so resounding that it was almost overwhelming. This is TRUTH, my heart said. Not just part of this, but every bit of it gave sound to the harmony I was seeking. It revealed the meaning I knew had to be at the root of our existence. And finally, the truth had been revealed. And each time I thought Neale had taken the revelation as far as possible, he has come back with another awesome addition.Seek your own heart's truth. There is none else. The God revealed in Neale's books gives us that freedom.Many people would have us believe that God requires much of us, but Tommorrow's God requires nothing specific of us. For some that is heresy. For some, that means that humanity will destroy itself with inappropriate behaviours.For me, and for my vision of my fellow man, the ultimate requirement God has for us, is simply that we take full responsibility for all of our actions, and that we truly USE the complete freedom of choice which God has so wonderfully bestowed upon us all.My vision of God is exactly that revealed so beautifully in all of Neale's books. Before these books, I had the beginnings off such a vision of God, but I could not complete the vision myself. I searched everywhere for the truth. It must be here somewhere, no? But I only found bits and pieces of divine truth, which were often intertwined with other bits of *human* truths which did not resonate in my soul.Why would God punish us? No, God has *never* punished us. We've been punishing ourselves. We are at cause here. That is the sign of the ultimate freedom which God has bestowed upon us. God allows us to think anything, say anything, do anything, believe ANYTHING. This is too much responsibility for most people today, but it is the key to the next stage in our evolution.I've always been spiritually oriented, but religion has not provided satisfying food for my hungry soul. Neale's books have provided that nourishment. They accelerated my personal process of unfolding. I feel so much more complete thanks to all of Neale's books.Thank you Neale and THANK YOU God.Now back to the wonderfully hard work of living, made easier by these revelations. And back to creating my grandest vision of the world we all live in, one interaction at a time.",

When Jesus was practicing his message, he too, was considered blasphemous. He shocked people with his message that God is Love and that the Kingdom of heaven...of God is right here and right now. Of course people didn't really believe that then and they still don't believe that.Wouldn't it be truly wonderful if we really believed that God was always right where we were? Wouldn't it be incredible if we really felt that God is a God of Love; that the Holy Spirit is within and around everyone and everything? Wouldn't the earth be a magnificent place if we could really accept, embrace, and embody the Truth that God has no preferences, needs, or wants...that God created us out of Itself...that we are spiritual beings right here and right now and that Love, Peace, and Joy are already within our hearts simply waiting to be released?Neale Donald Walsch creates a new vision for us to consider. Of course, certain people are not going to like it or agree with it because it challenges one to really look at what he/she may believe about God and their personal relationship to this Divine Presence. It always makes me a little sad when I see fundamentalists on television holding up the Holy Bible and then condemning others. Whatever happened to \"Judge not?\" or \"God is Love\", or \"Ye are gods\" or the other scriptures that point to a more spiritual approach to life?Everything is sacred. Every person is made in the Image and Likeness of God. There are no ifs, ands, or buts in God. God is total and complete Love and Love does not create conditions, limits, or restrictions.Jesus challenged the people of his day to look within. All great spiritual teachers do this. The reason we don't look within more often is because we are terrified of what we might find there...but I tell you this...past the personality, past behaviors, past anything of this physical world, there is a place of real peace, real joy, real love so complete...so total that once you've \"been to that place\", you can never go back to thinking or feeling that God is for some but not for all.May we have visions of a better tomorrow. May we be willing to see people for more than what they may believe, what their sexual preference may be, how they may live their lives. May we see everything and everyone as Holy, Beautiful,and Wondrous. May we know deeply that all that we see comes from all that we cannot see. May we treat others with compassion, love, and joy. May we be bold and daring and unafraid and know beyond any shadow of a doubt that God is right where we happen to be!Challenge your beliefs. Question yourself as to why you believe the way you believe. Demand answers from yourself. Don't hide under a veil of superstition, but awake to the Truth that that which created all is all!May this beautiful world return to the paradise it was created to be.",

Some possible social, economic and political consequences of embracing such a God are explored towards the end of the book. Much of this is brilliantly inspirational, even if you don't agree with all of it.Some religious fundamentalists still seem to feel threatened by the CWG ideas. Yet again Walsch is quite clear here about us EMBRACING all that works in existing religions. &quot;Not a replacement for the old, but an enhancement of it. Not an abandonment of your present religions, but a revitalization of them&quot;. &quot;BE THE HOPE OF HUMANITY&quot;, say Neale and God at one point, inspiring this reader considerably!",

They confirmed what I as a child believed about God before hell and vengeance and judgment came into the picture.On one thing we can all agree: the state of this world, and not just the U.S. and The Middle East, is downright horrifying. I will add that this horror is a result of primitvely long-held beliefs. Everyone is clinging steadfast to their ideologies without seeing that these ugly, human characteristics we place unto God are simply creating more and more detriment.

                "review/text": "This was a fairly good basic intro book for the issues of God/time and God's knowledge/future contingents. While this issue is usually discussed in philosophical journals and in books which cost an arm and a leg to purchase, Craig has brought the issue to the lay persons and scholars alike.Before I review this book, it must be noted that I disagree with Craig's position. However, I think that Craig has done a noble job in defending his position, and I respect him for that. If I was able, I would have given Craig's book three and a half (3 1/2) stars for my own disagreements with Craig's overall assertions and some of the misunderstanding Craig had regarding certain philosopher's and their assertions (i.e. Aquinas being one which was mentioned below).Craig's position in this book is that God is temporal (or omnitemporal) due to relations which occurred with the created universe (relations which were not present w/o creation). Craig argues his point based on several elements. First, Craig believes that God cannot remain untouched by the created order's temporality. In other words, according to Craig, God comes into (so to speak) new relations which were not present without the created universe. Second, Craig believes that once time begins at the moment of creation, God becomes temporal by virtue of His real relation to the temporal world. Third, thus God, at least, according to Craig, undergoes some type of extrinsic change due to this new real relation with the created world. These are Craig's underlying assertions regarding God and time.Also, in this book, Craig rejects Einstein's interpretation of the Special Theory of Relativity (STR). Note, I did not say that Craig denies STR, rather he agrees with the Lorenzian interpretation of the theory over and against Einstein's interpretation. You can read why Craig believes this, since he details it in several chapters of this work.I believe Craig's overall assessment of the issues is misdirected and wrong in several areas. First, He univocally predicates to God relations which occur between one human and another. This predication occurs via God's new relations with the universe. However, if God is a necessary being (which I think Craig would agree that God is), then any properties predicated of that Being must be predicated necessarily. However, if God is omnitemporal (as Craig asserts) then these properties must be predicated necessarily. By Craig's univocal predication, he does not predicate of God necessarily as he should. This is so because Craig declares that God &quot;changes&quot; from a being who is eternal to a being who is omnitemporal. This is, via Craig's view, an ontological change in God's nature and this is, I believe, metaphysically impossible. Either God is necessarily eternal or God is necessarily omnitemporal. He cannot move from one state to the other and remain a necessary being.Another problem I had with this book was Craig's misunderstanding of Thomas Aquinas' assertions about God and real relations. In chapter three (3), &quot;Divine Temporality,&quot; part II. &quot;Divine Relations With the World,&quot; Craig asserts, &quot;Thomas [Aquinas] escapes the conclusion that God is therefore temporal by denying that God stands in any real relation to the world.&quot; This could not be more inaccurate and wrong. Aquinas does not deny that God stands in any real relation to the world. In fact, Aquinas declares just the opposite. Aquinas asserted three types of relations: one where both terms are ideas, one where both terms are real, and one where one is real and one idea. That which is created, according to Aquinas, is really dependent upon God, but God is not really dependent upon the created. Thus, they are related as real to an idea. God knows about the relationship of dependence but He does not actually have it. The relationship between God and the world is very real, but God is not dependent in that relationship. In other words, Aquinas is only denying dependent relations between God and the world, not all real ones. Aquinas treats this issue in the Summa Theologiae, 1a. 13, 7, ad. 2. (Also, for an easy explanation of this issue see Norman Geisler's book titled &quot;Thomas Aquinas: An Evangelical Appraisal&quot; I briefly summarized this position based upon those two works).Overall, Craig's book is pretty good, but it is wrought with several problems. I appreciate Craig's work to bring this issue to the non-philosopher, so to speak, but I would recommend reading Craig's book in light of Brian Leftow's book titled &quot;Time and Eternity,&quot; and Paul Helm's work titled &quot;Eternal God.&quot; Both of these books are available here at Amazon.com.",

                "review/text": "In this fascinating treatment of God's relationship to time, William Lane Craig argues that God, though timeless without the universe, is in time since the creation of the universe. This detailed study encompasses a wide variety of issues, including the biblical conception of God, the nature of time, relativity theory, the linguistic account of tensed facts, and a slew of other topics.Near the beginning of the book, Craig considers arguments in favor of God's timelessness. He first considers arguments that God's immutability or simplicity necessitate a timeless nature. Craig points out that these doctrines, however, are more controversial than the doctrine of divine timelessness itself, and therefore cannot be used to support timelessness. Moreover, both of these doctrines have conceptual difficulties and lack a clear scriptural basis (verses discussing God's immutability only entail that God's character does not change).The next argument leads into some exciting territory. Defenders of divine timelessness sometimes argue that Einstein's relativity theory supports their view. Since the special theory of relativity implies that there is no absolute \"now\" but rather a plethora of inertial frames, we must reject the idea that God is in time. For if God is in time, then He is either in a specific inertial frame (according to which He is ignorant of real facts concerning all the other reference frames) or He is in multiple inertial frames (which leads to a radical splitting of God's consciousness). Since both of these alternatives are untenable, we are forced to reject God's temporality.Here, Craig argues that Einstein's interpretation of relativity theory is not the only valid interpretation, and, in fact, the physicist Hendrick Lorentz (a contemporary of Einstein) offers a better interpretation which upholds absolute time and space. According to Lorentz, measuring devices shrink or contract in the direction of motion, and it is impossible to experimentally determine one's absolute location and time, even though in reality there is an objective fact about the matter. Craig contends that Einstein's interpretation of relativity was heavily influenced by a verificationist epistemology and that Lorentz's interpretation is actually superior, since it upholds the commonsense notion of absolute time and actually accords better with some scientific findings.Finally, Craig considers the argument offered by some advocates of divine timelessness which contends that temporal existence is not adequate for God, as the most perfect being. Due to the inherent limitations of temporal existence, God must exist timelessly. Craig argues that, while the argument has some plausibility, it is inconclusive. God's omniscience entails that He always knows what is coming in the future and He never forgets what happened in the past, and, moreover, there is some evidence that consciousness of time's flow can be an enriching experience.In chapter 3, Craig offers two powerful arguments in favor of God's temporality. The first concerns God's actions in the temporal world. Given that God is creatively active in the temporal world, God is really related to the world, and is therefore Himself temporal. The second argument concerns God's knowledge of facts. Since some facts are tensed (and thus are past, present, or future), God's knowledge of such facts must change. For example, in order for God to know what time it is now, He must constantly change His belief about the current time. Craig argues that it is impossible for a timeless God to know tensed facts such as \"It is now 3:00 P.M.\"After discussing arguments for and against divine timelessness and divine temporality, Craig embarks on a fascinating discussion of the very nature of time. There are actually two main theories of time seriously discussed by philosophers today- dubbed the \"A-Theory\" and the \"B-Theory\" of time (or the tensed theory and tenseless theory of time, respectively). Essentially, the A-Theory is the theory of time of the man on the street. According to this view, there really is an objective `now' and things really come into and go out of existence. The B-Theory holds that `now' is just a subjective feature of consciousness and that things do not really come into or go out of existence. Past, present, and future events are all equally real.Craig argues at length that our experience of tense and the ineliminability of tense in language provides powerful justification for adopting the A-Theory. The B-Theory of time is primarily justified on the basis of a Minkowskian interpretation of the special theory of relativity, according to which reality should be understood as a four-dimensional structure called \"space-time.\" On this view, the universe just exists as a four-dimensional block and there is no room for tensed facts or temporal becoming. Craig argues that, once again, a Lorentzian interpretation of relativity can plausibly account for all the same facts and is metaphysically superior to the Minkowskian interpretation.Having considered the arguments for and against divine temporality and divine timelessness and surveyed the arguments for the competing models of time, Craig concludes the book by arguing that God is in time. However, as can be recalled from a summary of the arguments for divine temporality, Craig's case that God is in time is based on the existence of a temporal universe. Without that universe, there is no reason to think that God is in time, and, Craig argues, this view leads to incoherencies. If God has existed for an infinite amount of time prior to the creation of the universe, then why did He wait so long to create? Craig therefore concludes that God, though in time since the creation of the universe, is timeless without the universe.Anyone interested in God's relationship to time should read Craig's illuminating study in \"Time and Eternity.\" Whether or not you accept his conclusion, this book will help clarify your thinking on this complicated subject, as well as enhance your knowledge of a number of intriguing issues being discussed in philosophy and theology.",

Anyone who reads this book will come away with a much better understanding of God's relationship to time, and time itself, then they had before they opened it.The only drawback is that God's relationship to time is not a huge theological/philosophical topic, and therefore, this might not be a high priority book for many people.

                "review/text": "This is not just another book that will leave you wondering whether on not you are reading just for the sake of reading itself. Craig has once again brought to light some fascinating facts about time. He begins by giving a concise analysis of the history of relativity from Galileo and shows how Newton believe time and space to be absolutes in their own right. He further shows the development in history toward STR by introducing the laymen to Einstein's predecessors. Those of us who lack the acuity for physics can rest assured that Craig will enlighten even the most untrained in this area. He introduces the theory of relativity as a stepping stone to bring to light good reasons why Einstein's STR concerning reducing time and space to less than absolute, and preferring a verificationists point of view, is not as coherent as first thought in light of the discoveries in Quantum Mechanics. He goes on to show how combining time, as Einstein did to a three-D universe thereby making it a 4-D universe, has not shown that his model is anything more than a limited finite theory of time. This can be seen and understood when one considers how STR does away with those frames of reference that we all need in order to deal with one another on a daily basis. By bringing together the theory of tensed frames of time he cogently shows how STR is limited in its ability to take into consideration those areas of metaphysics that show the epistomology time. He continues to develope this idea throughout the book and never give rise to boredom as he builds a case for absolute time and space. The book is a good read and gives one the feeling as he reads that Craig is definitly a leader in this field of study. This book is an important reference for ones study in the areas of both biblical and philosophical theology.Happy Reading , Mike from Little Rhody",

                "review/text": "Bill Craig does an excellent job comparing the various views proffered by philosophers regarding the question of the nature of time. He explains the A and B theories of time well. As an A theorist, he considers the 'tensed' nature of time as the most 'common sense.'Briefly, the A-theory is that what is past is gone forever and what is future is yet to have happened. B-theorists believe time is dimensional and exists as an all-encompassing whole. A being outside of time, on B-theory could interact with any point in history as the present.Bill goes on to expound upon the nature of God's relationship to time. Since God is considered unable to interact with his time-bound creation from a position outside of time, Bill believes that after the moment of creation God himself became time-bound. So on Bill's view, \"prior\" to creation, God is atemporal and after creation God becomes temporal.He has been criticized for compromising God's immutability with his position, but he explains why he disagrees with his objectors. I personally believe the premise that God is unable to interact with his creation from a position of atemporality is a flawed premise. Hence I prefer the B-theory.Nevertheless, even though I disagree, Bill's treatment of the issues is very thorough and well thought out. I'd recommend a potential reader also read Paul Helm'sEternal God: A Study of God without Timeto gain two perspective on the issue.",

                "review/text": "Greg Boyd in his Is God to Blame? footnotes that William Lane Craig's Time and Eternity is \"a definitive refutation\" of Divine timelessness. Coming from Boyd, whose \"hexagon of opposition\" has accounted for contingency by reworking Aristotle's \"square of opposition,\" this is a high enough recommendation to buy Craig's book.While I do not agree with God's relation to time changing because of creation (and Craig himself admits that Personality implicitly requires duration/time; and the Godhead interacts from everlasting to everlasting), the more fundamental point is that the unfortunate tradition--based on rhetoric of words rather than concepts according with reality-- I say the tradition of \"timeless eternity\" always was flawed. We have nothing to fear by updating our language to line up with Scriptural revelation as applied in the context of a better understanding of God's creation (which itself arose from applying His Law to the study of physical creation). If, in the process, we also come to a better way to express His moral relations with beings created in His image, all the better for both evangelism and personal moral growth (sanctification).To put Craig (and his Molinist commitments) in context BEFORE reading this book, I highly recommend carefully reading God and Time, edited by Ganssle. Craig there shows, as in the present book, a wide reading and ability to interact philosophically. He comes to the same basic conclusion (a timelessness apart from creation, and a dynamic interaction since creation) - and Wolterstorff lays the axe to that, though not exhaustively nor so explicitly as to be unkind. The main point, however, is that despite various current theorizings about God interacting dynamically in a a real duration, the divine timelessness idea is shown to be no longer serious in theology (just look at the necessary admissions of Helm in God and Time - as I said, that viewpoint holds to a rhetoric of words, not a reality we can take seriously).All to say, read God and Time first. And also read Nicholas Wolterstorff's several page essay \"God Everlasting\" (sometimes titled \"God is Everlasting\"), he who also wins he debate hands down in God and Time.That said, Craig deals more extensively with the literature, as he does here in Time and Eternity. While his pre-commitment to Molinism still prevents him from embracing a fully contingent future (as created by God, within the created constraints on those contigencies), Craig still cuts us loose from the unnecessary moorings of \"Divine timeless eternity\" rhetoric to engage an intelligent world with Divine revelation that remains powerful across the ages. Molinism seeks to hold the old overall theological constraint of an exhaustively pre-mapped reality within the growing recognition of contingency for free willed beings. But this is at least a step in the direction of recognizing that God knows all things truly, including knowing contingency AS contingency (as evangelical theologian J. Oliver Buswell noted long ago).Time and Eternity gives the current lay of the land, and some interesting and thoughtful interaction. Even if the reader goes beyond Craig's thoughts, it is Craig who has done much spadework and who points the way. It is important in my library for the reason Boyd gives: it is a definitive refutation of \"Divine timelessness.\" Therefore, even defenders of the more traditional view must interact with it. While I say \"traditional,\" that is not to say that there have not been many in the past (including the prophets of the Jews) who never held such a mental conception of a pre-planned future; Augustine's neo-platonist syncretism is still causing us problems, defended as it was by the sword (see chapter 7 and Appendix A of Winkie Pratney's The Nature and Character of God for a concise summary display of Augustine's view next to identical non-reformed neo-platonic musings.)",

I found that the title of his book perfectly reflects its content. He truly explores God's relationship to time in light of the foremost prevailing arguments of physicists, philosophers, and theologians. Even where he patiently labors through some of the confusing, apparently fallacious arguments of contenders, Craig presents the opposing views with clarity and fairness and does his best to keep the reader on track. In his own inimitable style however, he is amusingly frank about the absurdities he unravels. In devoting a chapter to the relation of his conclusions to Biblical statements about God's existence in or before time, Craig gives focus and relevance to his arguments.Craig states in his preface that this book \"is written for Christians who want to grapple seriously with the concept of God's eternity\", and he does for the reader exactly what he set out to do. I came away with clarity and not confusion due to his articulate, precise, and well organized presentation. Moreover, even though it was slow going for me, the author's style sustained my attention and overall interest. While giving periodic hints, there was nonetheless an air of intrigue as to what Craig's final conclusion would be.

                "review/text": "I just finished reading the book Time and Eternity: Exploring God's Relationship to Time by William Lane Craig. This is, in my opinion, a very worthwhile read, though one that will most likely take time. The primary question of the book is: Can God rightfully be considered timeless or temporal?To answer the question, Professor Craig begins with a very brief survey of the biblical contribution. Does the Bible prescribe to one view over the other? His answer: no. The Bible, according to Craig is not a philosophical treatise on the nature of time and offers nothing sophisticated enough for us to make a definite conclusion. Concluding that the Biblical data is insufficient he asserts that the issue requires philosophical exploration to consider the issue clearly.He begins by analyzing the arguments for a timeless view of God. Rejecting arguments from the `simplicity and immutability of God (mostly on the grounds that these doctrines are controversial), he moves on to arguments from relativity theory. He starts by detailing a brief history of time (even briefer than Hawking's) and the Special and General theories of Relativity. This is a good and, for the purposes of the book, invaluable overview of the theories and their development, but I'm not positive that it would be sufficient for a full understanding of these developments in theoretical physics. This is by no means a flaw of the book, he did an excellent job making the relevant concepts accessible, but I would recommend looking at other sources to supplement if one is interested in this area. Hawking's book, which I linked above, is excellent. Also noteworthy would be Brian Greene's The Fabric of the Cosmos. It is worth praising Craig for his critical evaluation of Relativity theory. He makes several philosophical notes that the two aforementioned physicists do not engage in.The outcome of his overview of Relativity theory is that God should not be considered to have the temporal perspective of an inertial frame nor the sum of all inertial frames. Rather, he explains, that God is related to cosmic time. \"Now,\" he continues, \"as a parameter, cosmic time measures the duration of the universe as a whole in an observer-independent way; that is to say, the lapse of cosmic time is the same for all observers.\" (p. 60) All that to say, the theories of relativity do not preclude cosmic time; God can relate temporally to the universe and this is consistent the the data of physics.So much for physics. He then analyzes the arguments generally proposed in favor of divine temporality. The three arguments he examines are: from the impossibility of atemporal personhood, divine relations with the world, and divine knowledge of tensed facts. The first, considered by logical possibility alone, he concludes as untenable. God could logically exist as a person (or personally, or as Trinity) atemporally. The second fares much better, for God at very least commits to time by the very act of creating. The third argument is presented as the strongest, and is most interesting to me. This deals with `tensed facts'. Here, Craig explains that if God were atemporal the concept of omniscience would be unfortunately diminished. \"Tensed facts\" are expressed by indexicals that locate events as past, present, or future. Example being: \"I am now writing this blog post.\" expresses the event in present tense as it is happening, whereas tomorrow the tensed statement will say, \"I did write this blog post (yesterday).\" The point being that if God was not temporal, God could not know the relation of facts and events to the present (as God is not subject to `the present' or `now').Understanding that argument occupies the next two chapters (comprising 100 pages), where he defends the dynamic and tensed view of time against the static and tenseless view.The final chapters \"God, Time, and Creation\" and \"Conclusion\" Then look at how the dynamic view of time affect the concept of God and spend time focusing on the doctrine of creation. Here he asks if it is rational to speak of the infinity of the past prior to creation. He then argues that the past can only be spoken of as finite and examines how we can reconcile that with the fact that God has no beginning. I won't expound on this much here, but it should suffice to say that Craig concludes that God was timeless prior to creation but temporal from the act of creation onward.Finally, he includes an appendix in which he presents his argument for exhaustive divine foreknowledge and attempts to reconcile it with his dynamic view of time and human freedom. This is where my only displeasure with the book arises. I do believe the rigor with which he argued throughout the book lacks at this point. As that is only an appendix, I have only praise for the book as a whole.",

God is discovering the future along with us.In this great book, Dr. Ross fully restores the orthodox doctrine of God's transcendence. He does so with the aid of modern physics. Dr. Ross' argument is irrebuttable. Time is just one of the created dimensions. The Creator can see all of time at a single glance, just as He can see the rest of the universe. Our past, present and future are all in the present tense to God. His name, \"I AM,\" is more than just semantics!",

                "review/text": "For all of those who feel that Ross didn't do a very good job in relating the concepts of higher physics and theology, it would help to remind yourselves that this book wasn't written for scientists with a PhD, it was written for the layperson. If it had been written for you high-brow types, in a manner to suit you, it would no longer be a book that the average person could enjoy. I just want you to know that I am not uneducated, I have a degree in the mathematical sciences.Sure, sometimes the thread between the cosmos and some of the paradoxes of theology aren't completely answered by this book, but then theologians have been arguing these points for centuries. At least, Ross is attempting to pursue these questions in an original manner, from a cosmological and physics perspective. This is highly unusual, compared to the regular reading fare on this subject.It isn't that I necessarily agree with everything in this book, Ross writes as a Calvinist and I'm of the Arminian persuasion (for you science types, this is Protestant history and theology that I'm talking here), but he did give me provocative things to consider. For instance, how could the death of one be an atonement for so many people? How many dimensions does God have? Is God really in an infinite dimension? Why are we \"stuck\" in a space-time dimension which is extremely limited and where we die?Another book that helped to round out some of this was a book \"Hyperspace\" by Kaku. This is written for the layperson, but is written from a secular perspective (so some of its conclusions I didn't agree with, although it occupied only a small part of the book). However, it helped to fill in some of the \"holes\" to round out my reading for fun on this subject.",

This book, however, is one of those sad cases where a scientist plays theologian, with disasterous results.In this book, Ross puts limits and &quot;dimensionality&quot; on God. They are great and fantastic limits- but limits nonetheless.God and his attributes can be defined and understood within mathematical formulas that add 6+ dimensions to our 4 (length/width/heigth/time)and recent discoveries relating to Einsteins theory of relativity can mathematically make a case for the necessary existence of God.Sadly, the god defined in this book is one that has dimensional boundaries. The God Ross believes in (from the Bible) is transcendant, above all else- the God he defines in this book is encompassed withing created dimensions.Another problem arises from these &quot;created dimensions&quot; arising from the Big Bang- if God operates within them- what did He do before they existed? The logical conclusion would be &quot;nothing&quot; since He could not have.Science and Theology are two perfeclt legitimate realms of inquiry- not at all incompatible- but those trained in one often fall into trouble when making pronouncements about the other- this book is no exception. There is much in this book that is thought provoking, more along philosophic lines than scientific or Orthodox Christian Theology. I would recommend any of his other books,but not this one.",

                "review/text": "For many years I have believed that Scripture contradicts what is found in science. For this reason, I believed that scientists who do not believe in God, and vehemently oppose the concept of a God, must question the validity of findings that point to an origin for the universe. I'll summarize for all of his books here, because I don't remember which is which. They all sort of support each other.I would like to point out that Ross's primary goal with this book (and his others) is the demonstrate that our universe did, indeed, have a beginning. Einstein's theories have been proven beyond an inkling of a doubt, and those theories troubled Einstein himself. The origin of the universe. The concept is now a century old, and new research is only reinforcing the theory so that it is now, for all practical purposes, a proven fact.Another theory, that there are an infinite number of universes, and that our actions dictate our presence in one universe or another (as fantasized by sci-fi stories), has been proven wrong. It is now fairly well established that there is just one universe. This further erodes the chances for spontaneous life, because in the infinite universe theory, when infinity is involved, anything and everything will happen.Our universe had a beginning in the not-so distant past! It is not infinite, but expanding. COBE has measured the edges of the universe. Therefore, given the amount of time estimated for life to emerge, this universe--our universe--the only universe that physics points to--could not have evolved life spontaneously.Ross effectively teaches these concepts for the layman. The goal, of helping the reader to understand not ultimately how all the little details were worked out, but only that the universe had a beginning. That single concept is paramount! Without a beginning, there is no creator. With a beginning, there is a creator. Who knows what God really is? Who knows, really?The Bible was written by human beings. Anyone who has based their religion on the Bible must agree that the Bible is significant. How could so many individuals over so many centuries write such with such consistency? Do away with all biases toward your own religious beliefs--or lack thereof--and consider the value of the Bible for establishing values in life and as a historical text. Consider the age of it, and then compare modern scientific discoveries with the stories in the Bible. You will find no discrepancies.Take it at face value. We know that the universe and the earth is more than a few thousand years old. Therefore, what does Genesis really teach? How could ancient Hebrews have understood the concept of a billion, when their numbers did not go that high? The Old Testament Bible was written long ago, and is not a science text. We therefore should read it in that light. What does Genesis 1:2 really mean?For those who believe in God: Suffice it to say, Ross doesn't have all the answers, doesn't explain the meaning of the universe. But what he does do is help you to accept modern science and the teachings of our origins in the Bible. Ross's main point, and the one that I found most compelling is this: God does not lie. He created the universe as is. What we see is the real deal. God inspired the text in the Bible. Therefore, science must agree with the Bible. Accept the age of fossils and the apparently contradictory evidence that violent death happened before Adam and Eve, and that the world was full of life even while the two lived in the Garden of Eden. Do you really believe, as a good little Christian, that Noah ushered in behemoth dinosaurs onto the Ark? COME ON! The dinos were long gone by the time Adam and Eve came along. Within, the Garden was a haven. Outside Eden--the world was a harsh place. Death is a part of life. Lower lifeforms serve the higher lifeforms. That is just how the world works.Another of Ross's revelations is that of perspective--point of view. Genesis 1 and 2 take place inside the Garden. That which is described in those chapters is how life was inside the garden. Just like the 7 creation days are described from the point of view of the Spirit, near the surface of the earth. Not in space (as we might imagine the scene while reading it). From the surface of the Earth, as the atmosphere changed, the Sun, Moon, and stars appeared. How? Plant life and single-celled lifeforms, producing oxygen, clearing up the primordial atmosphere.Make no mistake!! Life could not have lived for even a single day without the sun! The temperature would have been hundreds of degrees below zero. Yes, even in that short amount of time. Why would God do it apparently backwards, creating Earth first, a frozen ball of ice, and then the Sun? No way. The oceans would have frozen over in an instant. Genesis is not contradictory. It clearly explains that God said \"Let there be light!\" He didn't say \"Let there be the sun!\" No. The sun was already there. What God did, at that point, was to say \"Let the light shine through!\" So let's just be practical, okay? God created the sun, moon, and stars long before the plants and animals. Perspective, which is a key aspect of the scientific method. Read Genesis 1 again, with this in mind, and you will see it is clear and wonderful. Ross clearly explains this. You will love this book! It's an eye opener.",

                "review/text": "Beyond the CosmosHugh Ross' book &quot;Beyond the Cosmos&quot; pulls science together with Pauline Christianity to show how many classical religious stories make sense when explained using the fourth and higher dimensions. Mathematicians and scientists have actively used higher dimensions and fractional dimensions (fractals) since the 19th century. In the 20th century, relativity, superstrings, black holes, quantum dynamics, and gravity seem difficult to explain without assuming that the universe has more than four dimensions.I found many parts of the book interesting, for example, the blurring of the infinite and the finite in Chapter 3, multiple time dimensions (&quot;the Creator's capacities include at least two, perhaps more, time dimensions&quot; and &quot;... our time dimension had a beginning...&quot;), and multiple space dimensions (&quot;... God must be operating in a minimum of eleven dimensions...or the equivalent&quot;). There may be a way to turn into higher dimensions (Figure 5.2). And the fires of hell may be a place where people &quot;get what they want more than anything else: freedom from the will and rule of God.&quot; There is even an explanation of why the people in hell have to be tormented while they exercise that freedom.The book fulfills its stated purpose and the flaws are only minor. It could be improved by discussing the effect of fractional dimensions, entropy, and dark matter in the universe. The book portrays the curious idea that there can be any freedom of will if a higher power (God, in this case) knows what we do. The book uses a particular vocabulary, referring to God as a personal being of masculine gender and employing translations of those verses of Scripture and of the Pauline writers that are accepted by its author. Nevertheless, mature non-Pauline Christians and non-Christians can simply accept this style of writing and enjoy this book thoroughly. For non-Christians, this book provides a fun introduction to what Christians believe.",

Using true anecdotes from the men, women, and families of the churches he has served, Barnes invites hard-running, stressed-out, burned-out people to stop striving.

He shows how Jacob never really believed that God blessed him, and shows how we do the same. He uses examples from our lives that make it so real -- for example, most people believe God is out there and loves people, but few believe he loves US. He even says that on Sunday he's worshipping God but forgets about God come Monday when the stresses hit.I particularly liked the chapter on Finding Love. He shows how Jacob's love of Rachel is a lesson in fantasy love. According to Barnes, Jacob was not in love with Rachel, but in love with the idea of being in love. So he works 7 years to make his fantasy come true, and then he marries both of the sisters. Then he works another 7 years to make his fantasy into a reality. Hence, don't chase fantasies. Barnes points out that all of us marry Leah and Rachel, meaning, there's the part of that person we don't want and the part we want. We get both, whether we like it or not.He continues to draw from examples at work and in the personal life. When one finishes the book, one is left in deep thought about all the blessings in life and how we just need to ask God to show us the blessing, rather than trying to work so hard for it all the time.",

Whether that be the Bible or Ralph Waldo Emerson or Neale Donald Walsch or even John P. Morgan...uhhhh...that would be me.What makes Neale Donald Walsch's books so icredibly great as well as so incredibly upsetting to many is that he dared to write a book based on a conversation he really felt he was having with God. I believe that God is talking to all of us all the time but a lot of us tune down the conversation to an inaudible volume and a lot of us tune the conversation completely out. People mention the Bible as the inspired word of God...yes, yes it was...but I know that this may sound like a shock to a lot of you, but it, too was written by men and just like in Conversations With God, there may be a few parts that are flawed and over-exaggerated, but the same can be true of the Bible. I don't believe that every single word of the Bible is \"Divinely Inspired\". Some of the authors of the various books were very biased and prejudiced and sexist. But there are parts of the Bible that are incredibly beautiful. The 23rd Psalm is one of the loveliest passages in the whole book and no matter how many times I've read it, I find it all the more lovely because when I am truly in a state of \"Oneness\" with my Creator, there really is nothing I could want, need, or desire. God's Grace truly is my sufficiency.I find a lot of passages in this marvelous collection incredibly inspiring and while we are talking about being inspired, do you know that it literally means to \"be in Spirit\". We can all be inspired simply by choosing to be in Spirit rather than in the world. As Jesus said from a rather inspired place, \"Be in the world, but not of it...\" and he also said, \"Judge not by appearances...\"You see, when I am truly inspired, i know that i am still in the world, but I don't have to be of it. I do not have to focus on greed, or lack, or disease...I can focus on health, prosperity, and plenty. In other words, I can focus on the truth that God is always and in all ways filling my cup to overflowing. I do not believe in a stingy God or a begrudging God; I believe in a Whole and Holy God that made everyone and everything out of Its Wholeness...out of Its Holiness...another inspired passage from Revelation: \"Behold, I make all things new...'This book will push you to the edge and may even tip you over the edge. If you are reading these books and becoming agitated and upset, maybe you need to ask yourself why that is. Maybe you aren't too grounded in your beliefs. Remember this, Jesus ticked off a few people in his time, too. All great people who have a great message to convey will upset other people. Why? Because great people usually listen to their hearts, their souls, their Inner Guides...they aren't afraid to be inspired...they aren't even afraid to die for what they believe in because you can kill the messenger, but you cannot kill the message.Mr. Walsch, I salute the incredible work you put into these books. Thank you for listening to your heart. Thank you for helping me to become just a little more inspired.We are all One in God now....peace and blessings, everyone...",

Walsch begins the first book by sitting down like a kid writing an angry letter to santa about the crappy christmas he just had, only the letter is to god and the christmas is his life. then, he describes how his hand just kind of sat there, and he was suddenly writing the words 'do you want an answer to any of that or are you just venting?' to which he sat wonderingly and then responded with 'answers', and the dialogue was born.an example of the kind of writing you will find follows.page 44, god- 'all physical life functions in accordance with natural laws. Once you remember these laws, and apply them, you have mastered life at the physical level.'skipping some dialogue after that to the next page, Neale asks, \"then how can I know these laws? how can I learn them?\"god- 'it is not a question of learning, but of remembering.'Neale- \"how can I remember them?\"god- 'begin by being still. quiet the outer world, so that the inner world might bring you sight. this in-SIGHT is what you seek, yet you cannot have it while you are so deeply concerned with your outer reality. seek, therefore, to go within as much as possible. and when you are not going within, come FROM within as you deal with the outside world. remember this axiom:If you do not go within, you go without.put it into the first person as you repeat it, to make it more personal.If I do not go withinI go without.'these books are literally filled to bursting with such cleverness, playing on words to make very decent points in my opinion, and will sparkle that brain of yours to make you think about things you may never have considered before if you have never read any new age material.the difference between this and most other new age material I have read, is this focuses on the same reality that books from the Kryon by Lee Caroll for example espouse, yet from that exclusive point of view belonging to organized religionists.the arguments reflect 'bible thumper' thinking, rather than what some call wiccan or 'tree hugger' thinking.for example, in a kryon book, you may get a topic about abundance, and the flow starts from 'you are all dearly loved' to 'you own your abundance, you yourself are denying it from you, not gaia or the world around you.' and finishes up with 'and so it is.'that's average new age flavor for you, and actually I don't mind that at all as I have seen some that is downright ludicrous marshmellowy fluff stuff.Walsch's dialogue keeps it much more down to earthish, although there is the occasional 'you inspire me!' which is kind of fluffy in my opinion but then god answers, 'well, if god can't inspire you, who in hell can?' which isn't.it is very easy to get a warped sense of view on the whole new age thing from so many out there who focus on aliens, and conspiracies, but the good ones focus on philosophy and how to think, not at all the same thing to my mind.a good website to check out if you are interested in looking at a quality contemporary and ongoing new age website is crimsoncircle.com, and kryon.com for material closer to when these books came out. I just bought seven of Walschs books, some of which I had read like these three and a couple I had not yet, and the one I am reading now, What God wants, I highly recommend if you enjoy the first three.He has a way of putting arguments that may be rolling around in your head down simply and compactly, at least for me, and it is fun reading the dialogue books for the clever plays on words and the startling way certain seemingly straightforward questions you may have asked yourself in that situation are answered.at any rate, they will make you think, strengthening your own personal philisophical foundation, which can only ever be good-again in my opinion, and while some parts can be a little harsh on the organized religionists, it is their own fault for being so closed-minded about everything they can't see such obvious glaring inconsistencies with their beliefs and philisophical approach to life.one thing more- these books are not seemingly written as attacking organized religion or anything, but the arguments and points of view expressed by them are definately unhealthy to the dogma of revered and traditional church-type canon passed down through generations of god-fearing men to save the poor sinners on the judgement day that hasn't happened yet.have a great day!",

                "review/text": "It is clear that this is the book that Christian fundamentalists (I say this as an American, but I suppose the Muslim and other fundamentalists elsewhere would also fight it) don't want you to read.Why? Because it takes control away from them. Our religions have taught us that God is more Judge than Helper. I know this as a former fundamentalist Christian, there was nothing more disturbing to my church than to hear that I was no longer going to humble myself, hate myself, give them money, and allow them to dictate every action in my life. Our religions teach us that we are dirty, despicable beings whom God created that way \"out of love\" but still holds it against us. That because God put a man and a woman into a garden thousands of years ago knowing (as God is all-knowing) that they would do what God defined as \"sin\", and them blame it on not only them but every other human being that has ever and will ever existed - we - every person alive - are responsible. Only the bloody sacrifice of Himself could have appeased him, and we're still born filthy sinners and have no chance of going to \"heaven\" unless we accept that this sacrifice actually happened and was for our own good, and thank God profusely and endlessly for it while also constantly grieving to God about how worthless and terrible we are, and confess every so-called \"sin\" to Him in complete sorrow and repentance, or else we'll go to hell to writhe in pain for all eternity, no matter how \"good\" the life we lived was.People criticize this book because it's \"feel-good\". Because God cannot possibly care about whether or not we feel good or enjoy our lives, the only thing God cares about is complete and total subservience. Even if most human beings were God they would not be so neurotic. In fact they would consider it immoral! Is God above His own law? Apparently; in the Bible he creates entire races of people only to command them to be slaughtered wholesale later.This book introduces us to a deity that makes sense. Not only that, but we are encouraged to question what is written in this book - by the author! This deity truly is loving and understands our purposes in everything. But before anyone accuses It (for it is neither male nor female, and both) of being wishy-washy, It shows us how causing harm to others and ourselves is overall a foolish enterprise.This God teaches us to love our God-given bodies, souls, and minds; not hate them and be ashamed of them, but to enjoy the sexual experience as a glorious union instead of teaching that pleasurable activities are wrong. The fundamentalists teach not to question anything of their religion - the reason is because they know that if you do you might very well see the nonsensicalness of their fear-based religion and the pettiness of their demanding God. In this book we are urged to find our own way, to love our lives and ourselves, to see the beauty and glory within our fingernails, all the way up to the greatest cosmic processes that are God in motion.I recommend this book to anyone who feels lost, wants to go beyond what they have already found or reached, and wants no longer to \"fear God\" (an action we're told is commendable by Western religion!). Anyone whose mind is not entirely a hard shell should benefit from it.As for the books themselves, I didn't like the third one so much as the first two, simply because I disagreed with some of its concepts regarding space/time and the Ultimate Destiny. But as far as these books and this God is concerned, that's perfectly all right. In fact, good, since I am discovering my own path rather than having it dictated to me. The first one especially should be a helper to anyone with questions in their hearts. I shouldn't say that it will entirely silence them, but it will give them possibilities and the knowledge to find one's own path.",

At one time, I used to believe as the naysayers. Then I started to wake up and truely see the illusion, for what it really is. People find that the hardest thing to accept is that what we truely believe in may not have been presented through the generations correctly. People have a hard time accepting that any belief, great or small, may not be totally correct. The closed minded will never see this. The wise and opened mined person will. I highly admire Mr. Walsch for revealing to the world, what he transscribed from his conversations with God. I truely and deeply believe what he has written. I believe because I can now see, for when before I could not. His works are far from rubbish. Most believe the Bible in it's present form must be accepted as is. I submit, where is the version of the Bible before it was ordered to be edited by Emperor Constitine in 325? Do you want the truth? Simply by learning to meditate on a daily basis, will allow everyone see that we are here to recreate ourselves anew in greatest version of the grandest vision of who we really are. ONLY IF you are truly honest with yourself and learn Meditation, you will then believe in these treasured works. I recommend \"Spiritual Breakthrough\" by John van Auken to learn meditation.

When I finally arrived at &quot;Where to Find God,&quot; it all seemed so simple, so obvious. Yet so elusive at the same time. It made me remember how important it is to take &quot;time outs&quot; during my hectic days to sit in the silence, rub my cat's belly, take three deep breaths, and know that God is everywhere and God is right here where I am.

Some don fancy dresses, others hold parties (complete with paper top hats and cardboard replicas of a little gold statue), still others simply shut off their brains and tune in their TV's to the annual Academy Awards ceremony. For weeks leading up to this event and for days after, all one hears is commentary about the look/dress/action/speech of the scores of gods and goddesses that walked the stage that night. And after the masses of people have picked clean all the Oscar glory there is, they turn to the upcoming baseball season to fulfill that emptiness they feel inside with a good old-fashioned sports god.Are you one of them? Are you LOOKING FOR GOD IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES? Marie D. Jones can help you. According to Jones, \"...our society can only see God in the pretty, the shiny, and the expensive. But God is everywhere...\" (p. 57).In LOOKING FOR GOD IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES, Jones enlightens the reader as to where God is really found, despite all the misguided attempts by society to find Him in only \"the pretty.\"Marie D. Jones, a New Thought minister as well as a licensed pastoral counselor with a master's degree in metaphysical studies, has given God much thought and study and is well-versed in the subject, which couples quite nicely with her lengthy experience as a writer. Jones has been widely published and is even a screenwriter who has produced a children's storybook series.According to Jones, we as a society spend way too much time looking for God in places we'll never find Him - sports and movie icons, wealth, power, so-called \"gurus,\" and co-dependent relationships, just to name a few. Her goal is to help the reader find the real hiding place of God, saying, \"...you never have to go any farther than your own Higher Power within to find wholeness, abundance, and prosperity in all areas of your life\" (p. 30).While the subject of the search for God is a weighty one, Jones manages to keep it blithe throughout. LOOKING FOR GOD IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES is light on the dry philosophy stuff and heavy on the jokes, puns, and catch-phraseology. Still, Jones manages to make some good points that somehow worm their way into the subconscious of the reader and while he may think he may have gotten only a few chuckles out of the book, he just may find himself worshipping a little differently after the last page has been turned.At the same time, Jones's jokes occasionally work against her ultimate message, as she pokes fun a little too personally and unintentionally sounds a bit taunting. Thus a sensitive reader might find offense at a statement that contains, \"... a bunch of spiritually inept yuppies with bad shoes and worse breath...\" (p. 82) and wonder if derision is working against the tolerance and inner love Jones preaches.Furthermore, Jones uses real life experiences to back up or further explain some of her points of interest. This is a good technique in reaching the reader through having been there/done that just as the reader may have. However, Jones seems to have experienced it all - every trap, every bad habit, every broken hearted experience. Opening up one's weaknesses on paper can be healing and humanizing for a writer, but too much of a humble thing can take away from the message as a reader might wonder just how to trust a messenger who's so easily bent and broken.The overall success of LOOKING FOR GOD IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES is that it's an easily understood and lighter look into spirituality that teaches its readers how to look inward and find God. It's a pleasant read unusual in its belief that you can find God and still have fun looking. If you've been struggling, looking for God in those wrong places, this book would be the right place for you.",

                "review/text": "When I first read the book Conversations With God a few years ago, I was deeply touched. Much of the insights presented in this unusual conversation were a wonderfully fresh way of seeing All is One and that All is Love. A year or so later, I was browsing the children's section of the bookstore and came upon The Little Soul and the Sun: A Children's Parable Adapted From Conversations With God. I read it right there and it brought tears to my eyes.Here it is some years later, and I've just bought this delightful book for my son as a Christmas present. This beautiful story is illustrated in lavish pastels by Frank Riccio, and features a parable about Little Soul--one who wants to experience itself as Who I Am. You see, Little Soul knows that it is Light--but feels that knowing isn't enough. So Little Soul asks God if it can actually feel what is means to be the Light. So God asks Little Soul how it can experience the Light when it is already as a candle in the Sun, along with the other billions of souls who make up the brilliance of the Sun? Little Soul entreats God to think of something--some way in which it can experience what it feels like to be Light.God answers Little Soul \"Since you cannot see yourself as the Light when you are in the Light, we'll surround you with darkness.\" Little Soul asks \"What's darkness?\" and God replies \"It is that which you are not.\" Little Soul asks God if it will be afraid, but God says \"only if you choose to be...there is nothing, really, to be afraid of, unless you decide that there is.\"One of the central themes of Conversations With God is that in order for God to experience Itself, It had to be contrasted with something else--something \"other\". You cannot experience dark without light, up without down, now without then, fast without slow. The purpose of duality is to experience parts of the God-self in all Its glory. In a sense, we are all a part of God, and God exploded into a million Souls to experience Itself.However, when We made the journey Earthward, We forgot where We came from--and Who we were. Little Soul and God continue the conversation, and talk about how everyone is special in their own way--each manifesting a different part of \"special\". Some parts of special include kindness, creativity, and patience. Little Soul decides that the part of \"special\" it wants to experience is the part of special known as forgiveness. A multitude of Souls gather around God and Little Soul to hear this extraordinary conversation, and God sweeps an arm towards them: \"There is nothing to forgive\" God says. Little Soul could hardly believe what God said. \"Everything I have made is perfect. There is not a single soul in all of creation less perfect than you. Look around you.\"Little Soul grumbles that this wasn't fun at all! How would it experience itself as One Who Forgives if there was noone to forgive? Just then, Friendly Soul offers to help him, volunteering to come into Little Soul's next lifetime so it can do something for Little Soul to forgive. Little Soul was incredulous, and aks why Friendly Soul, who was such a magnificent Being of perfect Light, would want to become dense and dark--slowing it's vibration in order to do this bad thing for Little Soul to forgive? \"Simple\", The Friendly Soul replies. \"I would do it because I love you.\" Friendly Soul goes on to explain that both it and Little Soul have been male and femaile, good and bad, victim and villian--All of It. \"Thus have we come together, you and I, many times before; each bringing to the other the exact and perfect opportunity to Express and to Experience Who We Really Are.\"In being the \"bad one\" this time around, Friendly Soul will give Little Soul the opportunity to experience itself as One Who Forgives. Friendly Soul becomes serious and confirms that it will have to become dense and dark to do this act--and that both it and Little Soul may forget Who They Were. Friendly Soul asks Little Soul a favor: to remember, in the moment that it strikes and smites Little Soul--doing the worst that it can possibly imagine--that Little Soul will remember Who Friendly Soul Really Is.An agreement was made, and Little Soul goes forth into a new lifetime, excited to be the Light--and to experience that part of \"special\" called Forgivness. \"...whenever a new soul brought joy or sadness--and especially if it brought sadness--the Little Soul thought of what God had said. 'Always remember', God had smiled, 'I have sent you nothing but angels.'\"My favorite passage of the book, which is the major theme of the New Age, is \"And so\", God concluded, \"when you are surrounded with darkness, do not shake your fist and raise your voice and curse the darkness. Rather, be a Light unto the darkness, and don't be mad about it. Then you will know Who You Really Are, and all others will know, too. Let your Light so shine that everyone will know how special you are!\"",

But this book does not answer the most fundamental question of all- Why is God, God and why do we have to be separated from Her bliss while God has the conscious of bliss All Ways?Did we as a part of the sum total of God, chose to be individualized and the part that is God chose not to enter the world of relativity? God seems to be enjoying Her existence without having to experience the opposite of goodness while we HAVE to experience the bad to realize the perfection in ourselves. Does this make us more courageous than God? We had the guts to come down from bliss while God chose to reside in bliss by always remembering how GREAT HE Is. In Hindu philosophy this part of God is called Brahman. He is in the absolute state for eternity. When the cosmos is created, Brahman remains in bliss while 'some' parts of Him is thrown into the universe.Is this fair?However, when I read the book without a 'questioning' mind this book is innocent, childlike, mesmerizing and beautiful to read, admire and inspiring. In fact it answers almost all basic philosophical questions such as why Jehovah permits evil.

        "description": "God's Debris is the first non-Dilbert, non-humor book by best-selling author Scott Adams. Adams describes God's Debris as a thought experiment wrapped in a story. It's designed to make your brain spin around inside your skull. Imagine that you meet a very old man who-you eventually realize-knows literally everything. Imagine that he explains for you the great mysteries of life: quantum physics, evolution, God, gravity, light psychic phenomenon, and probability-in a way so simple, so novel, and so compelling that it all fits together and makes perfect sense. What does it feel like to suddenly understand everything? You may not find the final answer to the big question, but God's Debris might provide the most compelling vision of reality you will ever read. The thought experiment is this: Try to figure out what's wrong with the old man's explanation of reality. Share the book with your smart friends, then discuss it later while enjoying a beverage. It has no violence or sex, but the ideas are powerful and not appropriate for readers under fourteen.",

                "review/text": "For those who love Dilbert, please realize that this book has nothing to do with that enjoyable character. There's also no humor here. Instead, you will find a fable that presents a unified theory of cosmology, religion, and knowledge. Before you get excited about all that you can learn, realize that this unified theory is deliberately flawed by Mr. Adams to provide you with a thought experiment to locate what is wrong with the argument. So the book is actually a brain teaser in its primary intent. It is a brain teaser that most people will find exceeds their knowledge of probability, physics, religion, philosophy, evolution, psychology and logic. So, to pick it apart you will probably need to assemble a team of people with deep knowledge in those areas. As a result, God's Debris is perfect for a serious book club. After understanding what's wrong with the arguments in the book, many will probably begin to see more unity in everything that happens based on a better platform of knowledge. That's well worthwhile.I found this book fascinating as a puzzle, and enjoyed picking the arguments and misstatements apart. It reminded me of a question on the bar exam from many years ago where I had to write about what the law was in regard to a will written by an illiterate person. Great fun!Mr. Adams warns that this book is for \"people who enjoy having their brains spun around inside their skulls.\" He also says that it is \"a view about God that you've probably never heard before.\" I certainly agree with both of those points. He also warns that what's in the book \"isn't true . . . but it's oddly compelling.\" He also notes that people under the age of 14 should not read it. Although he doesn't say why, anyone who reads this book without a foundation in the subjects described may actually believe what's proposed by the Avatar. The world has enough false beliefs in it. I applaud Mr. Adams for helping to avoid creating any more.After this book has honed your knowledge and critical thinking skills, I suggest that you take arguments that you read in other books and practice seeing what is wrong with them. All nonfiction books provide thought experiments of that sort!I do hope Mr. Adams will write another of these thought experiments.Overcome the appeal of simplicity to see through to the dynamic reality!",

He also states that this book is a \"thought experiment\" - i.e. the purpose is to get you thinking - it's not meant as a serious attempt to explain the universe and God.That said, - those folks out here who have panned this book because its assertions are not scientifically sound are [people] who missed the point and need to go back and read the introduction again. And those folks who dismissed the book out of hand as rehashed metaphysical stuff that they already know - well, they failed the thought experiment because they didn't use the book as a springboard to thought.Both of the types of people above actually prove one of the points in the book - that they are totally wrapped up in either arrogance or delusion. In fact, they probably didn't even realize that Adams was poking fun at them - oh, well.Anyway, in this book Adams' character presents, in somewhat herky jerky fashion, an odd view of the universe. Although the theory itself could probably be torn to shreds by an undergraduate philosphy class, the purpose is to get the reader to recognize the folly of thinking that we know the answers and to open themselves to the possibility that everything we think we know (religion and science) is a wrong, albeit useful construct - and in fact that we humans are intellectually incapable of fathoming reality.If you ponder metaphysics/spirituality a lot then you might not find that this book breaks any new ground for you - given that you are already open to thinking strange thoughts.If you're an unflinching religious zealot you'll find the book somewhat sacreligeous and, unwittingly proving his point, you'll either pray for him or send him an email informing him that he's going to hell.If you're a sober, stuffy scientific sort you'll pick the specifics of the theory apart with righteous and snooty \"I'm smarter than you\" arrogance and in doing so, miss the whole point of the book.But, if you enjoy mental exercises and realize that sacred cows make the best steaks, then you'll enjoy mulling over the ideas discussed in this book.It's short and a bit rough, but I gave it five stars simply becuase it earnestly attempts to give the reader's brain a good kick in the arse (if a brain can have an arse), and because it tries to slap some sense into prevailing scientific and religious cultures which have raised \"believing one's own hype\" to an artform.",

                "review/text": "In the Introduction, Adams admits that lots of what his Avatar says is wrong, and he challenges you to figure out which parts are wrong.I call this a cop-out. It is true that Avatar advances, with great authority and confidence, a number of ideas that are just flat wrong. However, there is no internal evidence that Adams himself recognizes these as errors. Does Adams think that gravity propogates instantly, or that a magnetic field cannot be shielded? There is no hint of irony to indicate that. The book's nameless protagonist is completely clueless. In the dialogs of Socrates (to which other reviewers have compared this book), the people arguing with Socrates make good points, have cogent arguments. In this book, the Avatar has the debate all his own erroneous way.The result is that people who are not well grounded in science find a lot of claims that strike them as &quot;challenging&quot; and &quot;thought-provoking&quot; when in fact the claims are simply wrong, and well-known to be wrong.For the record here are some of Avatar's errors of fact: (p19) magnetic fields can't be blocked; (p19) gravity propogates instantly; (p22) we don't understand how electricity travels; (p61) there is no friction between the Earth and the Moon (the statements about gravity and the Moon are wrong in multiple ways); (p66) the theory of evolution is a &quot;concept with no practical application&quot;.The Avatar advances a dangerous, nihilistic kind of epistemology. In plain language, he seems to dismiss all possible sources of knowledge as equally pointless. He dismisses mathematics as useless (p. 20-21, p56). He dismisses all of science (&quot;all we can do is observe and record patterns,&quot; p.22) as being unable to provide &quot;why&quot; answers. Finally he says that all ideas are equally valid (p38ff) because they are all identically &quot;memory traces&quot; in our brains. This may be what others have called &quot;New-Agey&quot; but in fact it is nihilism and defeatism.As to the philosophy, it is basically self-contradictory. If you take the time to read the book, read it carefully and then actually think about the Avatar's basic claims: (a) God blew itself up in order to learn the one thing omniscience could not know, namely, what happens if God isn't there; but (b) God imbued his debris with a &quot;probability&quot; so strong that even if the universe were rewound and played back, exactly the same events would happen over again (p.51-2). These ideas are fundamentally contradictory, hence the whole exercise is pointless.The Avatar does pose a number of philosophical riddles that have been standard fodder for student bull-sessions for generations. Example: if God is omniscient (Adams incorrectly writes &quot;omnipotent&quot;), the future must be determined, hence how can we, or God, have free will? But the questions are only posed, never explored in any satisfying way. Go looking for better books in elementary philosophy.",

                "review/text": "Three things piqued my interest in this book - one was of course that it was by Scott Adams who is without one of the best and funniest writers in the world. The second was that the introduction said that it would be a great book to discuss with buddies over a drink. The third was that it was a book that the author was giving away for free on the internet and I wanted to know why - there must be something he really passionately wants to communicate if he's willing to forego money he could easily get with his saleability.The book is basically a conversation between two men, one of whom (Avatar) is enlightening the other by asking him probing questions about life, the universe, etc in the tradition of Socratic dialogue. Scott Adam claims in the introduction that the views of Avatar are not necessarily correct or even his own... they are just things he would like the reader to question himself so that he can come to a better understanding of his own beliefs and whether they are flawed or not.I started reading it and soon got fed up. The views of the Avatar were by turns - obvious, well known or just silly. In fact the entire philosophy seemed like it had been written by a teenager after his first foray into metaphysics. The story was also flat and a little amateurish.But then after skipping through the last few pages I remembered that I wasn't supposed to believe every word according to the introduction. I was supposed to figure out what was correct and what wasn't in the philosophy which was going to be more interesting because it would bring to light just how little we actually knew about our world. So cursing myself for judging it too quickly I set about trying to read it againUnfortunately I once again found myself annoyed by the text. Some of the stuff was just wrong and I think people who don't know much about new physics, etc would assume that it was groundbreaking truth or if there was an inconsistency to mull over wouldn't spot it because after all how many people understand Einstein's general relativity view on gravity being derived from the topography of spacetime? And the people who did know anything about some of the philosophical, scientific, spiritual questions that Adams tries to raise would have been appalled at the cursory and inaccurate treatment of the subjects.Half the reviews I have read are ecstatic because they have a whole new worldview on what God and science are all about (scary thought considering that it means that Adams has created yet another religion of mishmashed inconsistencies). Or there are those who believe that Adams has stimulated their thinking in a very novel and wonderful way as to how little we actually know for sure about our reality. I personally think that it could have been done much much much much better (simply explaining Young's double slit experiment or Michelson Morley experiments coherently would have been enough!)The pissed off reviewers are those who forgot that it was a thought experiment and thought that Adams was actually trying to explain the universe (poorly).I personally think that despite Adam's protestations that he doesn't really necessarily believe the views of 'Avatar' and they aren't meant to be gospel he actually takes himself far more seriously than he admits. I think that he has actually started seeing himself as a mini-guru on the new physics and it's implications on philosophy. He believes that he can and should popularize the mind bending subject so that people out there get how weird the universe actually is. In other Dilbert books by him there have been arbit chapters at the end talking about these issues. Unfortunately he doesn't understand the subject in enough depth or with the intuition required to be the popularizer and what will happen is that the people who don't read philosophical and physics books will have no idea what he is talking about and the people who do will immediately see how poor his grasp of the subject matter actually is.It's interesting to see Scott try his hand at something that he is obviously very passionate about but not very good at. Can't blame him for taking such a huge risk. He is one of the best comic writers in the world and for Dilbert I'll forgive him anything - even this book. He's still a God in my eyes.",

                "review/text": "If you think that Scott Adams can only write comic strips (you know, Dilbert), you'll be as surprised as I was. Adams has tackled what many are tackling these days - basically a spiritual philosophy - but that few are succeeding at quite this well. I am telling you, this funny cartoonist is about as deep, thoughtful, and intriguing a writer as I've come across. Not complex, mind you, but deep.As I entered into his new book, God's Debris (just wait till you find out what the title means!), I was delighted to learn that he uses the language very well - especially for a philosophical piece like this, which, at its best, really only pretends at fiction. (It is primarily a philosophical dialogue between two men.) When the narrator steps into a room and sees a little old man sitting, I actually laughed to picture it as Adams described: \"Something moved and I noticed, on the far side of the fireplace, in a wooden rocker, a smallish form in a red plaid blanket, looking like a hastily rolled cigar.\" The narrator later tosses an extra log onto a dying fire, and we read that \"the retiring embers celebrated its arrival.\" Now, these points are not by any stretch the meat of the book - but it's important to know, this is not just some comic stab at writing.Nor is it a comic stab at philosophy. Adams examines really the core of who we are, and who God is, as well as numerous details of life, always conforming to certain central themes. His approach? Really a Socratic exercise, not necessarily answering the questions of the world, but certainly asking them. As for answers, these abound as well ... but Adams does not take himself so seriously as to insist on their accuracy. Rather, he wisely notes how intriguing many of the answers are, and challenges the reader to consider them too.I can tell you how I consider them: they are among the most convincing answers I have yet come across (for me, very much like What is Man? by Mark Twain - another comic with tremendous depth to his philosophy).Along the way, Adams certainly pokes and prods his readers, forcing questions that must make them squirm. \"If people believed in God,\" he points out, \"they would live every minute of their lives in support of that belief. Rich people would give their wealth to the needy. Everyone would be frantic to determine which religion was the true one. No one could be comfortable in the thought that they might have picked the wrong religion and blundered into eternal damnation, or bad reincarnation, or some other unthinkable consequence. People would dedicate their lives to converting others to their religions.\" He adds: \"If you believe a truck is coming toward you, you will jump out of the way. That is belief in the reality of the truck. If you tell people you fear the truck but do nothing to get out of the way, that is not belief in the truck.\" Now, do you believe in God?That example is a mere detail, though, and there is a much more important thread and theme running through this, dealing with the deepest questions of all. In its effort, it supports much of its philosophy with tantalizing scientific proofs, and with areas where science has fallen down. The philosophical portion thoroughly discusses who God is, what our relationship is to God, the nature of good and evil within these definitions, and other potent topics. I admit, I was sure at one point that the book was roaming randomly. But enough chapters passed by, and I was convinced that Adams was tying everything together. In the end, it's an experience!There are so many parts of this book that I'd like to share, but it would spoil the surprise. If you want a good challenge based in both science and philosophy for what God is, for what we are, for just what the heck we're doing here ... take a peek, and find yourself wondering about things, and probably - just probably - in brand new ways.",

I &quot;thought&quot; that the book was pretty disappointing, especially given the absurd hype it has receieved by Adams, the press, and others here.As fiction, the book is pretty weak. First, there's the intro, where Adams claims that what you're about to read will &quot;spin your brain&quot;, as if something earth shattering or important will follow. How many works of &quot;fiction&quot; need a prelude where they hype how interesting they're going to be? In the &quot;meat&quot; of the story we get rehashed philisophical debate. Some of the debates seem presented in a somewhat fresh, or at least more plain-spoken, wording, but there is little &quot;new&quot; or &quot;brain spinning&quot; here - at least to anyone whose had at least a bachelor degree level exposure to philosophy and/or logic.As a philisophical book, it has some gaping flaws. Many of the arguments put forth by the old man have significant errors, most notably the chapter on evolution theory. Instead of highlighting flaws with evolution theory, the argument put forth by the Avatar demonstrate that the he has a flawed interpretation of evolution theory. Odd coming from a character who is supposed to know &quot;everything&quot;.And I really don't understand the shift near the end to talking about men, women and their relationships. It doesn't fit with the rest of the information presented. It sticks out and is presented like something that was thrown in at the last second. Honestly, it appears as though Adams was trying to bump up the word count.The &quot;value&quot; of this book, if there is any, is that as a whole it reminds people to always attempt to see things from many angles, to not accept what they have learned as &quot;gospel&quot;, whether its the gospel of religion or science. But Adams covered all that in a single chapter in &quot;The Dilbert Principle&quot; (or was it the &quot;The Dilbert Future&quot;?). This is essentially a long-winded re-telling of the ideas presented there - though he does present a somewhat different view on affirmations.Not utterly worthless, but NO WAY near as original or entertaining as Adams' self-hype and some of the reviews presented here and elsewhere suggest. What keeps it from being a total waste is that the entire book can be read in ~2 hours, so one doesn't have to waste a whole lot of time.Mr. Adams: Please stick to comics.",

Mr. Avatar spouts some teenage philosophy at the guy, and the guy lacks the brains to argue or reason effectively. So Mr. Avatar goes unchallenged in his statements. Even though many of them are simplistic or muddle headed.The book is a carefully considered thought experiment. But it seems to have failed, and probably shouldn't have been let loose on the world. Adams sets up many straw men and knocks them down, but never puts his thoughts up against real competition. He makes extreme examples and fails to look critically at the leading questions he asks. He also makes some infuriating errors in terminology: God doesn't know everything because he is ominpotent, as Adams claims many times: The word he's looking forward to is omniscient, which is a different proposition. It may seem small, but it's just an example of the sloppy writing found in this screed.Finally, it's a short thought experiment, sure. But why no footnotes to back up claims like \"Einstein proved this...\" or \"Science proves that...\". I can say that Einstein proved that tinfoil hats protect me from the CIA. But I'd at least want to footnote such a claim. This book, in other words, is not for critical thinkers.",

Sadly, it's not fun, it's just tedious.The prose is stilted, the \"mind-spinning\" ideas are just poorly-constructed rehashes and mishmashes of convenient bits of postmodernism, gnosticism and a few theological philosophies, and the narrative framework is pure high-school creative writing. And really, anyone who's going to start writing about \"new\" ideas about philosophy and religion would be well-served to read and understand what's already been said, what's already been refuted, and how various religions deal with their own internal paradoxes, so the \"theories\" in this book can be at least a bit better-constructed even when they're supposed to be wrong.The argument that \"it's a thought experiment, and parts of it are wrong\" is, as another reviewer has said, just an intellectual cop-out. The book starts out with a bunch of errors and throws more around like confetti, and if that's the point of the book, then it's pretty lame. Figuring out what's wrong with the arguments is just grading someone's homework, not a thought experiment. It's worse still, considering nearly every argument in the book is either a misunderstood paraphrase of preexisting philosophy, or is argued from incorrect first principles. Where's the fun in reading along and ticking off \"yep, that's wrong, that's wrong, and that's wrong, that'd be right if he'd applied it to something other than quantum physics, that's wrong...\" ? It's a big snooze, not a deep philosophical insight.Scott Adams isn't a dumb guy and is usually a better writer, this much we know. As far as I can make out, though, he must've been totally baked when he wrote this. The only other explanation would be that he's profoundly arrogant about his own intelligence.Seriously, if you want a better-informed discussion of reality and philosophy, rent The Matrix. Not that the discussion is really deeper or more insightful, but the special effects are a lot better and it's a more entertaining way to kill a few hours.",

I am not a very religious person, but as this book points out: No one is right or wrong about religion. We're all just like curious bees looking through a stained glass window.

        "Title": "the god part of the brain a scientific interpretation of human spirituality and god",
        "description": "Is Man the product of a God...or is \"God\" the product of human evolution? From the dawn of our species, every human culture-no matter how isolated-has believed in some form of a spiritual realm. According to author Matthew Alper, this is no mere coincidence but rather due to the fact that humans, as a species, are genetically predisposed to believe in the universal concepts of a god, a soul and an afterlife. This instinct to believe is the result of an evolutionary adaptation-a coping mechanism-that emerged in our species to help us survive our unique and otherwise debilitating awareness of death. Spiritual seekers and atheists alike will be compelled and transformed by Matthew Alper's classic study of science and religion. The 'God' Part of the Brain has gained critical acclaim from some of the world's leading scientists, secular humanists, and theologians, and is as a must read for anyone who has pondered the question of God's existence, as well as the meaning of our own. Praise for The \"God\" Part of the Brain \"This cult classic in many ways parallels Rene Descartes' search for reliable and certain knowledge...Drawing on such disciplines as philosophy, psychology, and biology, Alper argues that belief in a spiritual realm is an evolutionary coping method that developed to help humankind deal with the fear of death...Highly recommended.\"- Library Journal \"I very much enjoyed the account of your spiritual journey and believe it would make excellent reading for every college student - the resultant residence-hall debates would be the best part of their education. It often occurs to me that if, against all odds, there is a judgmental God and heaven, it will come to pass that when the pearly gates open, those who had the valor to think for themselves will be escorted to the head of the line, garlanded, and given their own personal audience.\" - Edward O. Wilson, two-time Pulitzer Prize-Winner \"This is an essential book for those in search of a scientific understanding of man's spiritual nature. Matthew Alper navigates the reader through a labyrinth of intriguing questions and then offers undoubtedly clear answers that lead to a better understanding of our objective reality.\" - Elena Rusyn, MD, PhD; Gray Laboratory; Harvard Medical School \"What a wonderful book you have written. It was not only brilliant and provocative but also revolutionary in its approach to spirituality as an inherited trait.\"- Arnold Sadwin, MD, former chief of Neuropsychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania \"A lively manifesto...For the discipline's specific application to the matter at hand, I've seen nothing that matches the fury of The 'God' Part of the Brain, which perhaps explains why it's earned something of a cult following.\" - Salon.com \"All 6 billion plus inhabitants of Earth should be in possession of this book. Alper's tome should be placed in the sacred writings' section of libraries, bookstores, and dwellings throughout the world. Matthew Alper is the new Galileo...Immensely important...Defines in a clear and concise manner what each of us already knew but were afraid to admit and exclaim.\"- John Scoggins, PhD \"Vibrant ... vivacious.

                "review/text": "The thesis here is that spiritual and religious experience is essentially something the brain *does*, not something that comes from 'God'/'external being'. The author argues that spirituality and religious impulses have emerged in the evolving brain by default amongst evolving social organisms- in this particular book relatively recently in hominid evolution. Key processes include the growing hominid awareness of death, which, when coupled with an innate anxiety function necessary for survival, ultimately led to spirituality, religious and mystical experience.The author ties together his own spiritual journey with ideas strung together from the likes of Jung, Kant, Plato, Freud, Darwin and E.Wilson, but unfortunately, in my view, leaves out many ideas concerning group conflict-something with which 'groupish' primates are very much affected. One trouble with emphasising 'awareness of death' in the evolution of religious impulses, is just how relevant the 'fear of death' is to say, teenagers-and yet teenagers can have a quite developed 'spiritual impulse'. (eg The average age of 'religious conversion' quoted in the book is 15.2 years, from a study of 15,000). The association of prayer with healing is discussed, (ie essentially placebo, but also stress reduction), 'near death experiences' (neurochemistry evolved to reduce anxiety), 'speaking in tongues' (glossolalia-not explained here, but possibly, in my view, an infant/childhood mechanism overlapping into adulthood-like crying tears), and others such as guilt, morality, etc are discussed in the light of evolutionary theory as applied to human behaviour.One major point I think the author misses though, is that like consciouness itself, 'spirituality' is likely a holisitic and/or emergant brain function, there may in many cases therefore be no specific 'part' as such. Another problem I had is that he vastly under-rates 'thinking' in other biological organisms. For example, in describing pantheistic mysticism \"one feels that totality of the world is the greatest power and one can see themselves as part of that totality. During this experience a person has a sense that he is part of all that is around him\" (p111). Why couldn't this be a kind of territorial instinct?-it could therefore be in other animals. In describing monastic mysticism-\"a person experiences a surrendering of personal identity to a singular or central point of consciousness\" (p110)-again why can't this be present amongst other social, hirearcheal organisms? Also, theistic mysticism-\"seeng or feeling the presence of a personification or a named force which intones a higher power\" (p110). There is no discussion of the possiblility of any of these experiences having biological origins more ancient than recent hominid evolution. There may be a difference between the ability to be 'spiritual', and to ability to formulate abstract concepts. (How does a bat really 'think'?). His argument against spirituality in other animals is wholly the lack of religious rites (p84), but 'religious rites' do not necessarily constitute spirituality-as anyone disillusioned with conventional religion will happily tell you (He alludes to this on p149). Another example of his gross under-rating of thinking in other animals is on p117, where chimps are given foot-noted recognition that they can see themselves in the mirror only because they have \"evolutionary proximity to our species\".The association of schizophrenia and (some) religious belief is also not mentioned, although the association is obvious and has been pointed out by others (eg Jaynes). In his discussion on 'religious conversion', for example, he suggests \"when the ego is so riddled with anxiety that it ruptures, natural selection has installed our species with a physiologically based \"religious spare\"of \"cognitive transformation\", which often leads to \"rapturous contentment\". The cost of carrying this spare (in the gene pool) is \"the small price of personal identity\". However, there may also be more adaptive 'cost' than this-such a descriptive transformation is surprisingly similar to those who suffer schizophrenic breakdown through stress-there may *possibly* be a relationship, which is important. It is also possible that schizophrenia itself has biological precursors in other organisms-dissociating/splitting under stress may be adaptive.These points aside, his journey from religious skepticism to scientific explanation is tinged with individual strength and understanding, (notwithstanding what I would call his human arrogance). I liked his distinction between 'spirituality' and 'religion' (p149)-this is not widely recognised. I also think his points about different kinds of spirituality/mysticism are good- it seems our words for 'religion'/spirituality are woefully inadequate-which of course reflects our lack of understanding of the functioning of our own brains.Sociobiological in outlook-p156 quotes E.Wilson-\"scientists and humanists should consider together the possiblity that the time has come for ethics to be removed temporarily from the philosophers and biologized.\" I happen to agree, but with much caution-frameworks which have stood socially for thousands of years need to be challenged/complimented very carefully, with verifiable science and open discussion.The book is a strong attempt to understand human nature. Very good, very controversial, with gaps and weaknesses likely to be strengthened in future years through ongoing brain research. Other books recommended in this general genre of 'sociobiology' are \"Consilience\" (broader philosophy of science, religion, sociobiology), and \"Why God won't Go away\" (neurological basis of spirituality).",

Which, if any, of the hundreds of religions and sub-religions is correct? Why do religions change so much over time? How come every person's religious view is different from everybody else's? Just as I did, Alper began a personal search for the answers to these questions. He looked everywhere. Like me, he found that the answers to the big questions of &quot;faith&quot; lie not &quot;out there&quot; but within us. He then continued his search far beyond mine, came to many well-reasoned conclusions, then documented and explained his findings in 'The &quot;God&quot; Part of the Brain'. This work draws on many scientific disciplines, including evolution, psychology, anthropology and history, to put into clear perspective the origin of the human need to seek a higher power and, more important, the effect this need has on humanity and its cultures. I found the book to be a &quot;revelation&quot; of sorts in that it finally makes sense out of the din of competing religious views. In this book Matthew Alper shows an enviable commitment to truth, exacting logic and scholarly research as well as a vast intelligence as he explains his search and the answers he found. I did not want the book to end! It explains a very important part of what it means to be human. 'The &quot;God&quot; Part of the Brain' has already made a very great, very positive impact on my life.",

But then in the last chapter of the book, we are asked to somehow simply wipe out millions of years of genetic programming and start living as if there never was a God. If we do this, the author says the world will be a better place. According to this book, the people who believe in God are the ones who are responsible for all of the wars, murder, violence, and all other unmentionable acts. Somehow or another these people who believe in God are also responsible for World War One and Two. I don't remember reading anything in my world history class about these being religious wars. In fact, correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that it was the scientists who developed missiles and the atomic bomb during WWII. When there were religious wars, they were fought mostly with spears and swords. If the next world war is a religious war, I think we can thank the technological warfare of science for taking away the spears and swords and putting nuclear weapons into the hands of religious zealots. My point is that there is enough blame to go around for everybody, but credit should also be given where it is due. Science had provided us with the medical technology to cure diseases, and save lives. Religion has provided meaning for people. We don't have to look too far back in history to find a society that was based upon the tenets of science, and prohibited religious practice. How soon we forget the Soviet Socialist Republic, the utopia for scientism. Is this the model for the Godless society? Rather than have believers in science trying to get rid of belief in religion, why not try to find common ground? That is just what Ken Wilber does in his book, The Marriage of Sense and Soul. I just saw some numbers in a poll(it was a scientific poll) showing that a larger per cent of Americans believe in God than ever before in history. We ain't going away anytime soon. We can't condemn all of the scientists for the misdeeds of some, nor can we condemn all of the believers in God for the misdeeds of some. The book argues that the direction of evolution is to grow away from God. Teilhard de Chardin, who happened to be not only a scientist, but a paleontologist and a priest, came to the conclusion that the purpose of evolution is to find our way *to* God. Readers of the &quot;God Part...&quot; might want to read Teilhard's &quot;The Future of Man.&quot; You will see how Teilhard starts out with the same scientific evidence that Alper does, but comes to a whole different conclusion.",

This is a not-so-artfully contrived homily by yet another wanna-be priest of scientism. Being (close) to a Ph.D. myself in Cognitive Science, I'm always confused by the willingness of certain of my colleagues to oversimplify. The NDE chapter adressed anoxia, ketamine, and various other \"causes\" of NDE's, but completely ignored the fact that out-of-body experiences are had all the time outside of the narrow range of conditions he specifies. He also fails to explain the tens of thousands of NDE's with strange components, such as clinically dead folks coming back, and telling doctors of happenings elsewhere in the hospital (happening while they were dead), being completely outside of any ability of the experiencer to perceive. In other words, it's usually good practice to believe half of what you hear, and take even less to heart. I find it somewhat laughable that authors like Alper consider themselves \"rationalists.\" All I can get out of it is that he's a poor philosopher of science.",

                "review/text": "Evolution invests every organism with the physiology, drives and strategies for survival. Every child born possesses strong motivation to achieve clarity, resolution and understanding of the world in order that it may prosper. If nothing else, man is a learner and problem solver, pitting his highly evolved intellect against a dangerous and confusing reality. The ability to understand and thereby control his environment is the hallmark of man's evolutionary niche. This recently published work theorizes, however, that man's brain also contains a region hardwired not for understanding or rationality but self-delusion. While &quot;surviving&quot; consumes man's impressive physical and mental energy, survival is, as we know, impossible in the long term. Every man and woman is guaranteed to lose his genetically motivated quest to survive among the fittest. According to Matthew Alper's, \"The `God' Part of the Brain,\" this existential dilemma faced by sapient man alone, spurred the evolution of structures in the human brain which generate a cross-cultural predisposition for the metaphysical. This brain structure gave man the capacity to believe certain things existed even though none of his senses could confirm their reality. Why? Because belief in an alternate &quot;spiritual reality&quot; gave humans hope and consequently enabled our species to survive its unique and otherwise debilitating awareness of death. Religion provides a way to die, without actually dying. It creates &quot;Death-Lite.&quot; Alper theorizes that as man's intellectual evolution crossed the threshold of self-awareness, with it came the paralyzing knowledge of his own certain death. He was faced, as no animal before, with the problem of reconciling his innate arsenal of survival strategies and drives, with the debilitating insight that life was not survivable. The situation was dire. Life was like a fixed casino game. Why would anyone put his money on the table with no chance of winning? How could you play seriously? What was the motivation? Similar to cross-cultural drives as unlikely as those for music, humor, sport, dance, math, and language, Alper speculates that normal mutations formed rudimentary brain structures which allowed man to believe in an invisible world. Life for individuals with more highly developed &quot;God Parts&quot; in their brains was a lot easier. Unlike the others, they did not live life like cornered animals, constantly facing the withering finality of their own demise. Constantly hopeless. Constantly in a nerve-racking, exhausting, fight or flight mode. Religion, the ultimate survival strategy, allowed man once again to focus his formidable intellectual capacity with purpose, toward prospering and with this, continued evolution. With further evolution and the advent of society, however, came language, science and greater understanding of the physical forces governing the world as well as the psychological and social dynamics governing life and society. This knowledge, running leaps and bounds faster than evolution ever could, made religious beliefs much less plausible, much harder to maintain. Alper posits that this dissonance causes modern humans to be at odds with themselves, caught between their inherent quest for reason and their impulse to believe in the supernatural. In no uncertain terms, Alper veiws religion now as an often troubling appendage with largely outlived usefulness. It inserts irrational and fantastic elements into the lives of adherents, distancing them from the possibility of living more fulfilling, healthy and reality-based lives. It hamstrings man's original strong suit: rational thinking. He also speculates on the future of religion and its role in the lives and society of the animal possessing a \"God Part\" or capacity for \"spiritual cognitive function.\" He believes that man must come to understand the origins of his inherited, biologically-based religious inclinations and become aware he is born into a &quot;neurological web of deceit.&quot; Only then will he have a chance of offsetting his far-too-often destructive spititual impulse. The 185-page book delineates Alper's lifelong quest to understand religion and the religious drives which pervade all cultures, as well as his personal struggle to arrive at the role religion should play, if any, in his own life. He supports his theories citing the work of numerous philosophers, scholars and scientists as well as religious texts. His ideas rest most centrally on the writings and inquires of Philosopher Emanuel Kant, Psychologists Carl Jung and Jean Piaget, Evolutionary Biologist Edward O.Wilson, and Neurologist Dr. V.S. Ramachandran. The book depicts the author's intent to make rational inquiry into the fact that every human culture regardless how isolated, invariably maintains a belief in some form of a spiritual reality and the implication that this has a universal biological foundation. A screenplay writer by profession, Alper lives in Brooklyn, New York. \"The `God' Part of the Brain\" is his first book. His future projects include \"The Infinity Gene: The Evolution of Mathematical Consciousness and our Belief in Immortality.\" -30-",

But, although I agree with the conclusion that no gods exist if we can only have knowledge of &quot;things as we perceive them,&quot; I do not agree with Kantian metaphysics (i.e., subjectivism).Alper argues that because human reason is not adequate to provide us with objective knowledge of reality, a god or gods probably does not exist (this is a summary, his writing is much more eloquent). Again, I agree that no gods exist, but not because humans are incapable of answering that question, but because we are (in other words, I adhere to Objectivist metaphysics and epistemology).Alper's argument is well written, and is an important contirbution to religious and atheistic literature. But his conclusions are based on bad metaphysics. I also think his conclusion could be turned around: If objective knowledge is not possible for humans, yet we have a bend toward some kind of vague &quot;spirituality,&quot; then doesn't that constitute 'prima facie' evidence that a spiritual realm exists?Of course, Alper would be correct in saying that that means no religion is capable of &quot;Truth,&quot; but on a &quot;subjectivist&quot; view, neither is Alper. This book is great as a description of a personal journey, that is why it got 4 stars. But for an argument for atheism, or even a discussion of the limits of human knowledge and religion, turn to &quot;Atheism: the case against God,&quot; or &quot;Objectivism: the philosophy of Ayn Rand.&quot;",

I found it very interesting, intriguing, and eye opening to a whole new possibility of thinking. While I will not divulge everything of the book and all his examples and explanations I will try to summarize the basis of the book. The basis of the book is that the author, Matthew Alper is explaining his research using mechanical means of explanation of a God or a god(s) using the means of science/psychology/religion in seeking to find out about a belief in a God or god(s). The main idea of the book is that mankind through evolution and natural selection has been physiologically &quot;hard-wired&quot; to a belief in a transcendental/immortal/ethereal soul in a spiritual reality and the existence of our concept of a God or god(s). Mr. Alper suggests in his book that mankind through his evolution at one time was unaware of his existence, or rather his existence as being mortal. Alper goes on to suggest that over a period of time through evolution the ego (i.e. mankind's own personal conscious) became consciously aware of his mortality thus creating an anxiety in mankind. This newfound anxiety of mankind becoming aware of his own mortality created in mankind by means of evolution and natural selection created a cognitive part of the brain which Matthew Alper terms the &quot;god part of the brain&quot; This &quot;god part of the brain&quot; enabled mankind to relieve his anxiety and fear of death by means of having a cognitive belief in a transcendental/immortal/ethereal soul and the existence of a God or god(s).

He's smart and well read, and he presents a lot of interesting material. Few people tackle the question of god with as much humility, rigor and seeming lack of agenda as well as he does. Few people attempt to blend science and spirituality with the balance of open-mindedness and rigor that he does. I recommend it highly as a personal account of someone on the search.However, I do not recommend it as a book with much to say about the answer to the Big Question for someone else. He comes up with a conclusion, and I'm afraid my review is going to be a spoiler. So if you want to enjoy the explorations and follow him as he asks his questions with equally open mind, I would stop reading this review now.In my opinion his conclusion is a direct result of his process. His result was pre-ordained by his methodology and the decisions he made along the way. He walked himself into a box canyon and then concludes the canyon leads nowhere. I could see the result coming a thousand miles away. I don't think he had an agenda ... the book is personal enough for me to believe he has an open mind ... I just don't think he let his mind far enough out of the box.To appreciate where I'm coming from as a reviewer, I've signed up for the belief that we all create our own reality. And I believe that in just about every way one can believe it.So, in chapter 5 the author struggles with what he knows for certain about god, he comes to the conclusion that god is a word. At one level this is brilliant. It is just about the only thing one can say with certainty ... that \"g ... o ... d\" are 3 letters that form a word and exist as a concept. But this is where he starts to put god in a box. He now believes that god IS a word, and if we create our own reality, we now know that he is doomed to discover that god is only conceptual, which is what he discovers. Once he tried to anchor his search in certainty, all the aspects of god that can be experienced but not \"known\" by the mind got excluded from the search. I almost put the book down at this point, but the tale of his search was interesting enough.Once he put god in a box, his mind then jumps to a lot of conclusions to support the box. Although the book is filled with excellent questions and a generally rigorous approach, he takes a few key left turns very quickly and doesn't seem to recognize them.For example, he devotes a whopping 4 pages to plant medicine (e.g., mescaline, psilocybin) as chapter 10. The end of those 4 pages concludes with, \"In essence, the fact that there exists a certain class of drugs - molecular combinations - that can evoke a spiritual experience supports the notion that spiritual consciousness must be physiological in nature. Herein lies the basis for an ethnobotanical argument against the existence of either a spiritual reality or a soul.\" What? Because a physical thing can cause an experience, the experience must be physical? At this point his argument is circular. It's like saying that because I'm in a physical body, the spiritual body doesn't exist. This sounds like a reasoned argument, but it's just an opinion, obviously one this reader disagrees with. But again ... I don't fault his search or even his conclusion; I just don't think his conclusion encompasses what is possible. For example, he never considers the possibility of viewing the plant itself as spiritual.If I try to summarize where else I think he put himself and his conclusion in a box, it shows up in chapter 19. He discusses Kant (which I have not read) and agrees with Kant's perspective that humans are \"forever bound to our relative human perspectives which are framed by the way our brains process information.\" So far, so good. But then he \"applies the same argument to spirituality\" and concludes that all our spiritual beliefs \"constitute nothing more than manifestations of the way our species happen to process information and therefore interpret reality.\" The problem is this: he does not equally apply his conclusions to himself, the I. Yes, we are bound to our perspectives. Yes, spirituality is a fabrication of those perspectives. But there is a paradox he skips over ... I, also, am a fabrication of my perspectives. I don't exist as I think I do. But that doesn't mean I am not real. It also doesn't mean that the spiritual experience is not real. He's willing to accept the physical reality of himself in spite of his limited perception, but he turns the same argument against the existence of the spiritual. Again, the conclusion he arrives at is a simple function of how he applies his arguments.He buys into the standard argument that belief in an afterlife is a result of humanity being conscious of, and afraid of, death. This argument always ignores the fact that many of the people who have come as close as humanly possible to the experience of death, but not died, are often the people who have the least fear and hang-ups around death. Talk to someone who has survived a terminal cancer diagnosis. By and large they are not the ones locked up at home afraid to live. It's the people who keep death at arms distance who are afraid of it. This argument never holds water with me.So, as you can tell by my review, the spoiler is that he concludes we are physical beings and nothing more. I would say that this is the reality he has created for himself and he has done a magnificent job showing just how to create that reality. But if you are looking for a more expanded sense of self, there are other approaches that can lead to a different conclusion that are also completely consistent with rigor and the scientific method.",

God likes the world to grow.&quot;The book is interactive as each page ends with questions directly related to the text that help children explore God and their relationship to God.The illustrations are colorful and comforting, showing people from different races.I highly recommend &quot;God's Paintbrush,&quot; especially for those who are looking to explore the meaning of God with their children. It will engage and stimulate the religious imagination of children and help them to think of God as a special friend.",

                "review/text": "God's Paintbrush, written by Sandy Eisenberg Sasso and illustrated by Annette Compton, is a different kind of picture book. It does not have a central character (or characters) and it does not tell a story. It is more a collection of vignettes about everyday situations that children encounter. Each short narrative is followed by a question, or questions, that connects the issue with how God fits into our lives.One example is that of a young boy talking about his best friend moving away. He says he is sad and he hurts inside. The question is then asked, \"What do you think makes God hurt?\" Another example is a scene where Mom and Dad are tucking their child into bed, giving him hugs and kisses. The question, \"What does God's touch feel like to you?\" makes you think about being able to \"feel\" God's presence. All the concepts help to illustrate how God relates to all aspects of our lives. The questions that go along with each scene are thought-provoking and sometimes unusual. No answers are given to the questions. This allows the reader to think about the ideas and come up with answers on their own.What I Like: I like the different format for the book, as well as the variety of scenarios and situations presented. The language of the text is also beautiful. It's quite poetic and invokes powerful mental images. One example is: \"I think the wind is God's breath moving through the world, making it come alive.\"What I Dislike: The watercolor illustrations are colorful, and represent many multicultural issues and cultures, but they are a bit sloppy in appearance. I think they distract from the text rather than add to it.The title of the book was also somewhat misleading. Because it is called God's Paintbrush, I thought it would be filled with beautiful artwork representing God's wonder and glory in the natural world. However, the only mention of \"God's paintbrush\" is on the first page: \"A sunbeam peeked in my window this morning, and painted a rainbow on my wall. I think the sunbeam is God's paintbrush dipped in a watercolor sea, painting clouds and coloring our world.\" With the exception of this first page, the title seems to reflect the \"painting\" of the pictures that illustrate each different concept about God.Overall Rating: Good.Age Appeal: According to the publisher, the book is meant for 9-12-year-olds. This is probably because the reading level is too high and the book too long for younger readers to make it through on their own. However, I think 4-8-year-olds would enjoy the book, if read aloud to them, and broken down into small chunks, as the book is rather lengthy for a picture book.Christine M.

In Guidance we are presented with non-trivial explanations on how to align our lives in such a way as to be open to the direction of God. I was particularly impressed with the depth of the book. Before even stating how we are to hear God, Willard discusses the role our beliefs have in the matter. This seems so obvious, but it is so often overlooked. It is obvious because if we do not believe that God speaks through events and other happenings we will always be waiting for the quintissential lighting bolt of inspiration. Willard also discusses the role our very lives have in communion with God. He states that if we are not living lives in alignment with God's will it will be pretty hard to hear God, since in essence we are ignoring Him in our very being. Thus Willard elaborates on two themes that I have not found in other books. Only after this discussion does Willard launch into how we come to recognize God's voice - not normally in a thunderous clang but in the small whisper leading us to right action. This was especially important to me because I have had much contact with Christians who seem paralyzed if they get no momentous sign from God after a few prayers. But Willard tells us that sometimes - believe it or not - a person may not hear that big bang and make a decision and still be following the will of God since whatever choice they make will be in accordance with God's will, granted that they are living a life in close communion and alignment with God. I commend Willard for this penetrating book. At least for an engineering mind like mine it made great sense and certainly explained the totality of my interaction with God in asking for guidance.",

This is not a book on prayer, though prayer is discussed as the essential medium for a personal relationship with God. It is about living with God as a shaping force in our lives. The genius of this book is found in that it describes a relationship with God. It tells us what life in relation with God looks like. Willard suggests that it is our difficulty in hearing the voice of God (the word of God) that hinders our relationship with Him. The book answers the question of whether or not we actually can hear the voice of God, how God speaks to us, how we can know it is really God, and how we are to respond when God speaks.Having a conversational relationship with God is grounded first and foremost in faith. We must trust in the One who holds the future, who reveals His will, and who wants to take up residence in our hearts. We must believe that God wants all of this for us. A conversational relationship with God means that we cultivate a heart that is able to hear God speak. We are able to know and sense God's presence with us. We are aware of God's presence in our circumstances, we are able to hear the Still Small Voice of the Spirit, and we are able to read the Bible in such a way that it shapes the manner in which we live. Like any relationship or any form of communication, this takes time, maturity, practice, and skills. Willard provides insight into all these areas.There are no quick roads to blessing in this book. Willard provides no shortcuts because God offers none. He merely asks us, \"Do you trust God enough to care about what He says, listen for what He says, and then live according to what He tells you?\" May it be so.",

I've asked many times how I might be able to hear God speaking directly to me, and I never thought there could be a practical approach to the issue.Willard begins by dispelling images of the God-human relationship that make humans to be nothing but marionettes or drones in God's service, not unlike the Stepford Wives. Instead, he invites us to believe the Bible stories in which God directly addresses individuals. We can believe confidently that God would speak to us that way, God does, God can, and God should.There are many ways through which God speaks, but the preferred method is the still, small inner voice (p. 89). We should not subscribe to \"Bible Deism\" (p. 107) and assume the Bible alone is the only way that God speaks. God also speaks in phenomena, angels, dreams, audible voices, and other human voices (p. 91).When the word of God is planted in us, it washes through us and replaces all of the false ideas and confusions with truth (p. 152). Christ then lives in us and we are able to pray the Scriptures in order to meet him. As we read, we should follow this pattern: reading for information, longing for it to be son, affirming that it must be so, invoking God to make it so, and appropriating that it is so (p. 164).As we begin to discern the still, small voice within us, there are three things that will confirm the message: circumstances, impressions of the Spirit, and passages of Scriptures. Usually the three will confirm the message simultaneously. The voice will be calm and confident. It will not contradict Scripture. The more we listen, the more familiar it will become. Willard recommends spending an hour after praying for God's word doing something that requires attention but allows one's mind to wander, like gardening (p. 199). A general attitude of listening makes him open to what God wants to say.Finally, there are summary steps to follow in hearing God (p. 213-5). 1. We are born again and seek to know how life should be morally lived. 2. We seek to live in service. 3. We meditate on the Scriptures. 4. We are alert to the events of our own lives. 5. We address the issues of our lives directly to God. 6. We listen to God. 7. If we do not hear from God, seek to clear obstructions from our lives, ask the counsel of two other wise Christians, and then act on what seems most reliable.Willard's book is a practicum in mysticism. It is the question that every theist longs to ask and usually does not feel entitled to or doesn't feel capable of answering. This is an open door to contact with the divine, and yet it is simple and accessible. This should be standard seminary reading.",

He doesn't repeat himself or reduce his writing to a 3rd grade level so some reviewers find the book \"difficult\" or \"boring\". It is not.However it is only half the story. Willard assumes that there are only two types of Christians, those who hear God speak just like Willard does, and those who haven't yet heard God speak just like Willard does. He assumes that others don't hear God speak the way that Willard does because and only because they don't know it is possible. Willard tells us that his preferred way of God speaking, through an interior impression, is better than other ways that God speaks to us, such as through dreams. He also assumes that we can always hear God.Willard has nothing useful to say to anyone who has heard God but then experiences a time when he longer hears God. That possibility is simply not imagined in his world. The problem seems to be the flaw of the excluded middle in Willard's world view. In Willard's world view there is God and Man but he ignores spiritual powers.Sometimes people who believe that they can hear from God, and have heard from God do not hear from God for a time because of spiritual war. For an account of hearing from God in the midst of spiritual war from a non charismatic I recommendWalking with God: Talk to Him. Hear from Him. Really.Other accounts of Christian spirituality speak of an experience of silence intended to purify a believer. This experience is often termed 'the dark night of the soul'. I am not entirely sure what to make of these claims but any account of hearing from God is incomplete without at least mentioning the possibility.Willard's account of hearing from God is a good one, and will be beneficial to you especially if you are an introverted intellectual with a tendency towards Augustinaism and if your are not not currently the subject of sustained spiritual attack,",

How is God accomplishing His purposes and revealing His will to His people, ever molding them into the holy people He wants them to be? In this newest book from Dr. Henry Blackaby, the ways of God are explored so that Christians might share a glimpse of understanding of things too great for the mind to hold. Dr. Blackaby discusses how the ways of God reflect His nature and glory, how they are different from the ways of man, and are constant and consistent with His word. The ways of God are to bring His children into holiness in order to enter into a relationship with them. Eternal and mysterious are the ways of God.",

If our society were to be annihilated in some sort of catastrophe, and only one book were to survive for the remaining people to discover, this book would probably be the most advantageous one they could find. It may not be the most profound book ever written, but it is extremely valuble because of the amount and variety of historical information conveyed. It provides wisdom from the viewpoints of dozens of important philosophers and religious thinkers, and reads like some kind of greatest-hits albulm. There are other works that may be more modern and far-reaching, and others that may be more unique and individualistic. But the _Perrenial Philosophy_ accomplishes exactly what it set out to do, which is catalogue and explain profound quotes from a wide variety of great thinkers. Some readers might have preferred that Huxley interject more of his own ideas, but if you want to benefit from the wisdom of dozens of great authors without having to buy each one of their books (if they're even available), then I highly recommend that you buy this book.",

                "review/text": "Simply stated the Perennial Philosophy is \"Thou Essence is That Essence\". Each of us is a unique iteration of the Spiritual Source of the Universe. A microcosm of the macrocosm. Created by God as a godlike being for it takes a god to worship God fully. When I use the word God I could just as easily use any of the other names for the ineffable source of existence. The tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao. We are gods, but not the God, lest any man or woman should boast. To fail to see that we are a part of God is an illusion, to think that we are God is a delusion. The seer is intimate with a peace that passeth understanding. God is not only within ourselves, but within all other people as well, even the rest of Creation, God is omnipresent. Pride is a tricky devil. I am an aspect of God, therefore I must be God. Wrong dear solipsist. I am here too. And so are others. God is not One, God is a unitive One. \"Totality is a unitive one.\" Hui-Neng. The Kingdom of God is a family. We are each a part of that which has no separate parts.God is a synergetic whole, more than one but less than two. An irrational, beyond rational, whole between one and two, a paradoxical number, a numberless number. God is ineffable. This reality we find ourselves in isn't your dream or mine, we are however links in the great dream chain of existence. Our material Universe is a simulation, a learning tool for spiritual beings. An illusion conceals, a simulation prepares. The glass is half full, or half empty, you decide. Are you an optimist or a pessimist? As Teilhard de Chardin once noted, \"We are not human beings having a spiritual experience, we are spiritual beings having a human experience\". Essence is prior to existence. Spirit is prior to matter. Wu is prior to the body/mind complex. Though it is true that there are no lines of demarcation in Nature, our Universe is interconnected, there are areas of confluence, fields of concentrated energy, such as you and I. All created things are such. That part of us that has not been created, that part of our essence that is divine, is found within the holy of holies, our heart, our soul. We are spirit. An awareness of our true selves is essential for the full expression of our potential to be godlike beings, to be childlike beings. To return to innocence is to let go of our conditioned egos and be our original selves. Life is a test in which we either grade ourselves fairly or we are held back. We get to do it over and over again until we get it right. We graduate from one level of understanding to the next without necessarily leaving this relative reality. Our world changes as we change. Made in the image of God we are co-creators with God. Meditation is about coming to this enlightened realization through direct experience rather than the result of a rational conclusion. We are spirit. Nonduality, God, cannot be described in dualistic terms, rather merely suggested. God is like... Thus the use of Parables and Myths and other such forms of metaphorical expression where God and eternal truths are concerned. We cannot say what God is, only what God is like. I AM THAT I AM. Certainty is the product of pride.The essential part of us, our spirit, was never born and will never die. The purpose of life here in the realm of duality is not to play a game of Solitaire with ourselves, but to play a game of Hearts with each other. This is the message of all the great Mystics from all the great spiritual traditions of our world, past and present. Our material but insubstantial reality comes from an immaterial but substantial source. God is eternal, and so are we.This book by Aldous Huxley is one of the greatest books ever written about the Perennial Philosophy. It is must reading if you want to know more about the truth of the universality of truth. No religion has a patent on God. As that great Christian Mystic Meister Eckhart once said, \"God is like a great underground river\". Meditation is the technique nearly all great mystics have used to dig sacred wells into the great underground river of spirit that flows through and beyond every manifested thing. I say nearly because there are exceptions to every rule but this rule. Grace is the final arbiter. With that said, take personal responsibility and dig your own well my friend. Just don't get to thinking your well is the only well. This is the Philosophia Perennis in a nutshell. Now Go.For futher reading on the Perennial Philosophy may I suggest some of the following authors. Karen Armstrong, Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, Joseph Campbell, Meister Eckhart, Rene Guenon, Thomas Merton, Rumi, Frithjof Schuon, and Huston Smith, among others.",

                "review/text": "I first stumbled on _The Perennial Philosophy_ decades ago as a teenager, and it provided a sense of direction which eventually led me out of the enchanted forest of religious absolutism -- not into \"relativism\", but into tolerant pluralism.The underlying design of how religious language works in the \"perennial philosophy\" is clear, plausible and logical -- but apparently incomprehensible to the strident fundamentalist, who prefers the use of political coercion to sober deliberation. . . The issues are really quite simple:1. The ultimate source/goal of virtually every religious system is considered by its devotees to be undefinable, beyond the grasp of human reasoning, ineffable, surpassing understanding. Humans call this Ultimate: Godhead (as distinct from \"God\"), Brahman (as distinct from \"Brahma\"), etc.2. Since this religious Ultimate cannot he rationally defined, described, analysed, or plotted by mathematical models, religious language usage differs from that of the physical sciences. It employs verbal, visual, musical, metaphorical, mythological, and allegorical symbolism to SUGGEST that which humans may experience without being able to define: \"When I heard the Learn'd Astronomer, etc.\" (Whitman). . . (Here is where we part company with the rigid rationalist for whom there is no reality apart from what can be measured or weighed.)3. Religious systems arise at different times and places with various mythologies adapted to local needs. As long as these anthropomorhic creations lead the devotee to spiritual realization, they have value -- but not necessarily EQUAL value with every other mythology. Every individual understandably considers his own belief system as BETTER than those of others, and possibly the BEST of all; but this is radically different from claiming that his beliefs are the ONE AND ONLY POSSIBLE WAY to religious realization. BEST leaves open the possibility that other practices may be viable, though inferior; ONLY is binary -- you're either in or you're out, and that can make all the difference in the world. Consider the following:4. In 9th-century Buddhist Japan the Shingon monk Kukai wrote a treatise on \"The Ten Stages of Religious Consciousness\" in which he predictably placed his own Shingon Sect at the top of the list. A competitor, the Tendai monk Saicho had no problem with this but was annoyed that Kukai placed the practice of the Kegon sect on the 9th rung, just ahead of Tendai on the 8th. Note that both Kukai and Saicho clearly recognized that all three sects provided ways to achieve spiritual realization, although one might be considered a BETTER practice than another. This is pluralism, NOT relativism (one thing being just as good as another). And neither claimed that his was the ONLY possible method.5. Almost 5 centures later in his _Sand and Pebbles(Shasekishu): The Tales of Muju Ichien, a Voice for Pluralism in Kamakura Japan_ says in his Preface: \"There is not just one method for entering the Way, the causes and conditions for enlightenment being many. Once a person understands their general significance, he will see that the purport of the various teachings does not vary. And when he puts them into practice, he will find that the goal of the myriad religious exercises is the same.\" And where does Muju get this idea? Basically from the Mahayana tradition, especially as expressed in _The Lotus Sutra_,q.v. Once again, the alternative to religious absolutism is inclusive pluralism, not \"relativism\".In 1945 Aldous Huxley almost certainly never heard of these examples, but he was, and continues to be, a major force in introducing and defending religious pluralism in the West. _The Perennial Philosophy_ continues to inspire.",

One minute you're slicing a banana atop your corn flakes, and the next minute you're looking straight into the Light that all things are created in and out of. And after I had that experience of \"knowing\" that life was something more than this external form, I went on a rather mad search to see if I could find anything that would back up my experience and one of the first books I bumped into was the Perennial Philosophy by Aldous Huxley.After reading this book, I was angry. Not at dear Mr. Huxley who beautifully pointed out why all religions and traditions have strands of the same Truth and Wisdom flowing through them, but I was angry that I belonged to a species that was so obviously stupid.I frequently sat outside at the local coffee shop in my black beret, my black sunglasses, and black overcoat on chilly 90 degree days looking at the people walking to and fro with complete disdain. I often grumnbled, \"Don't these people realize how beautiful and wondrous life truly is? The poor slobs.\"And what I was doing was in complete opposition to the Perennial Philosophy. I was no better than the overexcited religionist who wants to \"prove\" that his religion is better than yours/that her God is the \"True God\" and I one day I took my blinders off and looked in the mirror. I looked in the mirror until the form before me dissolved and the Light that I was created in and out of came forth.And I found myself rejoicing at the happy fact that all of us live in such a state of amazing grace. That this is the beauty of life; that it waits and it waits and it waits for us to notice it and when we turn to it, it races with joy and with love and with beauty to give us everything that it has and the Truth is, it NEVER withheld anything from us in the first place.Does that kind of sound like the parable of the Prodigal Son? Well it should. Jesus knew that God was not withholding; that God is Love and is Love all the time.Religions stress sin, evil, repentance, and separation but the revealer behind the religion knows in a beautifully innocent way that the One Life of God...of Spirit...of whatever you want to call it, is in and through everything seen as well as all that is unseen and this is the common thread that runs through every mystical experience and every individual who was daring enough to have one. It is the knowledge that is within you right now and is waiting for you to simply \"wake up\". You are the prophet you've been wating for. You're already \"saved\" why are you resisting the procedure? The Kingdom of God is now at hand within you and around you now.My cynicism has softened over the years and even though there are times where I can easily (too easily) see things as black or white, I know that there is a stretch of gray that is as big as eternity itself, where beauty and grace reside waiting for me to rememember over and over and over again, that all there really is, is Life Itself and Life needs no one to defend it or protect it or be saved for it. It stands on Its own Formless, Real, and Perfect moving into and through all, as all.Buy this book. Buy a cup of coffee. Have an experience. Read, assimilate, drink, enjoy. Here's hoping your intellectual experiences transcend themselves into something much, much more.Peace & Blessings",

They have worked successfully in Jack Hartman's life and in the lives of many people who have followed these principles. Jack carefully points out the differences between the world's system of prosperity and God's laws of prosperity. He explains that all of the warnings in the Bible against financial prosperity are warnings against following the world's system of prosperity. God's Word clearly indicates that He does want us to prosper as long as this prosperity is achieved by following His laws of prosperity. These laws are laid out in detail in sixteen chapters of specific instruction -- every chapter filled with many verses of Scripture. The book closes with a unique \"test\" in which readers can test themselves on their knowledge of God's laws of prosperity. Jack Hartman believes that our economy is going to experience a definite down-turn and he urges all Christians to study and apply God's specific instructions for prosperity and success. God's laws of prosperity are not in any way dependent upon the condition of a man-made economic system. Now is the time to start learning and applying these laws.",

Wells' personal religious beliefs, making it a must-read for fans of his work and highly recommended for those with an interest in Christianity. Contents include: \"The Cosmogony Of Modern Religion,\" \"Heresies; Or The Things That God Is Not,\" \"The Likeness Of God,\" \"The Religion Of Atheists,\" \"The Invisible King,\" \"Modern Ideas Of Sin And Damnation,\" and \"The Idea Of A Church.\" Herbert George Wells (1866 - 1946) was a prolific English writer who wrote in a variety of genres, including the novel, politics, history, and social commentary. Today, he is perhaps best remembered for his contributions to the science fiction genre thanks to such novels as \"The Time Machine\" (1895), \"The Invisible Man\" (1897), and \"The War of the Worlds\" (1898). Although never a winner, Wells was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature a total of four times. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive.

The sequel being a similar analysis of religions, was titled God The Invisible King.Here Wells defines his position as a strong believer in one God and proceeds to evaluate the dogmas of the Christian Churches. He describes the notion of Trinity as an Alexandrian contamination three centuries after Jesus from the Nile, declared into creed in council of Nicea, and made fundament of all Churches of Christianity since then. Well calls the bluff of mysteries of the Triune or trinity, attributing an anti-religion motive to the institution that has been instilling this dogma into children. He describes his own childhood experience and how he was driven away from the Creater by the dogma.It should be read together with Thomas Paine for a complete perspective of scriptures, institutions and effects on which the religion in the West is based.It is a pity that the other two boks of Wells which make a series with this one are not included among books offered here. I thought they were missing even among books out of print. These are, as said above, First and Last Things and The Open Conspiracy.Wells is going to make a spectacular come back in one of these days, to take most established institutions by surprize, as very graphically and prophetically described in When the Sleeper Awakes! Also an immortal book.Have fun.",

I would have thought him to be an atheist, but obviously he was not. His comments on the subject bring that to light, and interestingly he dubs atheism as a religion.He calls the Council of Nicaea the most disastrous of all religious gatherings and expresses a lot of disagreement with current Christian dogma, particularly the cruel and arrogant portions of it. I definitely agree with him on that.I think Christians' insistence that their way is the only right one and you will be tortured in hell forever if you don't agree cannot possibly be true and is inconsistent with the actions of a loving god. Wells also talks about the popular belief that people are born into sin along with a lot of other spiritual topics, on which he has many interesting points to make.What I liked the most about this book was Wells belief that organized religion is unnecessary to spiritual growth and, in fact, harmful. I strongly agree with him on that. I was also very interested to read his thoughts on this subject. This is the only book like this that he has ever written, and his beliefs surprised me.",

                "review/text": "I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this book. Throughout the entire first half I was planning to give it 4 stars because it greatly inspired me. In the second half Wells' weak arguments dropped it to 3 stars. By the end the book was such a confusing mess that I dropped it to 2 stars. Finally I bumped it up to 3 again just because it is a good historical resource into Wells' thinking. Honestly I say it's 2 1/2, but I'm having a really hard time giving an H.G. Wells book fewer than 3 stars.Everybody knows that H.G. Wells was an atheist. At least that is a common conception, but in this book Wells' vehemently denies it and spends the entire book laying out his form of neo-theism. I was confused by this and did a little online research. According to the H.G. Wells Society of America, Wells was an atheist but went through a religious phase due to the emotional trama of World War I. Supposedly he rejected those religious ideas later in life; I will have to read my copy of Wells' \"Experiment in Autobiography\" to get a better understanding of his religious views. In any event, \"God the Invisible King\" was written in that religious phase contemporary to the First World War.The purpose of this book is to lay out H.G. Wells' religous beliefs and those of \"modern religion\". He explicity claims on the first page that he is not a Christian. Although to us it seems like he is trying to promote a new future movement, to Wells himself this modern religion was already happening in his day and was the direction that religion would continue to go. (He might have been right except that the reactionary fundamentalist Christian movement changed modern religion into something quite different.) First Wells lays out the difference between the Creator God and the Christ God. The Creator God is that power behind the universe which is distant from man and can be seen in God the Father of the Christian Trinity. The Christ God is the personal aspect of God which is in people's hearts and whom people relate to. Wells claims to be decidedly agnostic towards the Creator God, whom he calls the \"Veiled Being\" and says is both unknowable and irrelevent. He does however literally believe in the Christ God. In making this distinction Wells actively denounces Trinitarian theology, and after this distinction is made all references to God mean specifically the Christ God as opposed to the Creator God.What is Wells' God like? He did not create the universe. He is not omnicient, omnipotent, or omniprecent. He doesn't know everything or have all power. He doesn't work miracles or answer prayers (although Wells contradicts himself on this point later in the book). He doesn't judge or condemn us. But according to Wells this God is definitely a person. He is a personal God whom we can know, but we don't really pray to him or worship him in any direct way. Mostly he is there giving us courage, feeling our pain with us, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with us, and we are supposed to serve him with everything we do. Wells says that it is impossible to prove God, but we can experience him directly.I must admit that in the first half of the book Wells says it much more compellingly than I do. In fact for the first half I was inspired by this God and thought that I as an atheist could almost believe in a God like this. It seems like kind of an amorphous feel-good God that doesn't really exist out there but is a very real and important part of our psyche. But Wells doesn't want us thinking like that because he constantly reminds us that God is a real external person.Unfortunately the inspiration and though-provoking aspect of this book wears off halfway through when Wells makes half-hearted attempts to prove the existence of his God. Wells makes the same old agruments that would later be made by C.S. Lewis in \"Mere Christianity\", but Lewis did it much better. For example Wells tried to prove the existence of God through the existance of human morality. Lewis at least tried to prove the existence of objective morality (and failed), but Wells did not even try. He simply \"proved\" that objective morality exists because it is obvious to common sense. Therefore God exists. A thin argument indeed.This book started as really good and went to mediocre, but after 2/3 in it just gets bad. I had to skip a lot of pages to find major points in the argument and to find anything that made sense. Here Wells transforms his God from a feel-good entity that lives inside of us to a militant ruler. He says that people need to change their perspective so they do everything (especially work) for the glory of God. If we all do our jobs to God's glory, then we will enter a socialist paradise ruled by God himself - the Invisible King. But God never comes down from heaven to rule earth in physical form. No, God is our dear amorphous leader who rules through humanity's combined actions (or something like that). It is a call for an end of governments and the rise of a theocracy ruled by God with no priests and no church. (But of course God never comes down physically, and as wells said earlier in the book, God never sits on a throne.) God forbids the wealthy from giving their belongings to the poor, but he also forbids them from enjoying their wealth and being greedy. All wealth and all labor somehow work together through the glory of God to create a human paradise. The problem is the Wells seems like a communist in one sentence and like an Ayn Rand objectivist in the next sentence. It would probably take a lengthy book for a modern scholar to sort out Wells' economic and political ideas.I really wanted to like this book. I found it inspiring at first, but ultimately it fell flat on its face. I was struggling with the rating, but after writing this review I have decided that this book sucks and gets 2 stars. When Ayn Rand and Karl Marx join forces to create a churchless theocracy run by nobody, then I think it's time for H.G. Wells to go back to writing science fiction.",

                "review/text": "The January 24, 2011 issue of The New Yorker had a cartoon that expressed the feelings of most people. One character said to another: \"I'm in the market for an easier religion.\" Readers of H. G. Wells' God the Invisible King (1866-1946, written in 1917), which is not a novel, but expresses his views of God and religion, may think that he reflects this attitude. Actually the reverse is true. He writes that people must learn to act, not passively wait for divine aid. Some readers may disagree with his views, but they should find them thought-provoking.Wells states that he is not a Christian and his ideas are not Christian. He says that he believes in a \"personal and intimate God.\" He rejects the widely held dogmas, especially the \"disastrous\" idea of a trinity. There is \"no revelation, no authoritative teaching, no mystery.\" Ideas such as a virgin birth and resurrection and sin are untrue. These dogmas prevent people from thinking about the truth, make them passive, and discourage them from living a proper fulfilling life.The word \"God,\" he writes, could mean God as nature or God as helper. The first, he says, is the God of Spinoza and the second the God of the human heart. Wells believes that if a person accepts the first understanding there is no problem, but he prefers the second. When people petition God for help, the same God that helps everyone, no matter what the person's religion. God is not a being attached to a particular religion. All people are, metaphorically speaking, God's children. God is not found in a building, but in the heart.Wells defines God as \"boundless love,\" a \"friend,\" \"courage,\" and \"salvation from the purposelessness of life.\" God \"works in men and through men.\" He does not intervene in this world to help people. He neither rewards nor punishes. People do these things to themselves. Prayers do not help. God lacks the powers and knowledge attributed to him.Wells states that God \"is as real as a bayonet thrust or an embrace,\" he is the king, we must do what he wants us to do. Yet, he also says that he is not the God of old, but the God of youth. \"He looks toward the future,\" he loves us \"in the sense of\" wanting us to achieve the best. God's \"nature is the nature of thought and will.\" These statements suggest that God is a human invention; God is that which is in humans that causes them to strive to better themselves and the world. Obeying God means striving to better ourselves and the world.Thus, for example, the current behavior of lawyers and judges is outdated, incompatible with \"what God wants,\" with the human goal. The lawyer shouldn't seek to present only his client's view in a dispute and hide facts that support his adversary. He should only take cases that he considers just and seek the truth, justice, and the common good. So, too, judges should not decide cases based on conformity to technical rules, but truth, justice, and the good of society.Thus, Wells sees the idea of God as a challenge to humans to be all that they can be and to improve society to become the best it can become.",

        "description": "Why does a loving God allow humans to suffer so much? This is one of the most difficult problems of religious belief. Richard Swinburne gives a careful, clear examination of this problem, and offers an answer: it is because God wants more for us than just pleasure or freedom from suffering. Swinburne argues that God wants humans to learn and to love, to make the choices which make great differences for good and evil to each other, to form our characters in the way we choose; above all to be of great use to each other. If we are to have all this, there will inevitably be suffering for the short period of our lives on Earth. But because of the good that God gives to humans in this life, and because he makes it possible for us, through our choice, to share the life of Heaven, he does not wrong us if he allows suffering. Providence and the Problem of Evil is the final volume of Richard Swinburne's acclaimed tetralogy on Christian doctrine. It may be read on its own as a self-standing treatment of this eternal philosophical issue. Readers who are interested in a unified study of the philosophical foundations of Christian belief will find it now in the tetralogy and in his trilogy on the philosophy of theism.",

                "review/text": "In Providence and the Problem of Evil, Richard Swinburne, one of this century's best Christian apologists, finally gives us a full-length treatment of evil. Swinburne presents us with an explanation of evil that focuses not just on our free will, but on the importance of mutual responsibility as a prerequisite of free will. One place where this stands as a stark improvement over previous accounts is that it does not simply take for granted the value of free will; rather, it places the value of free will within the context of moral responsibility. Admirably, Swinburne attempts to integrate an account of natural evil into his account of moral evil. Natural evil is ultimately the result of a law-governed world, a prerequisite for the operation of morally significant free will. Despite the usual intellectual rigor and vivacity of his work, there are some significant problems which Swinburne has left unresolved. (He had been making revised versions of his works recently; hopefully these will be addressed in a future edition.) First, his account of evil often falls flat in the face of concrete evil, requiring that we see such things as childhood cancer as ultimately a good thing because of the opportunities it affords us to be caring. It rings especially hollow, if not sounding positively perverse, in the face of tremendous evils like the Holocaust. Second, Swinburne does not fully treat a relevant problem raised by J.L. Mackie some 30 years ago--that every opportunity for higher-order good (such as caring, sympathy and the like) are also opportunities for higher-order evil. If Swinburne follows his current strategy, we stand in risk of an infinite regress of higher-order goods. Lastly, Swinburne never recognizes that his treatment of natural evil is really no more than the atheist has to say about the issue with the further complication of God and free will being added to the picture for no clear (or even possible) gain in our understanding. As Swinburne himself in his other works focuses on simplicity as the be-all and end-all of explanation, this final lacuna is greatly regrettable. However, despite its problems, Swinburne's book is an excellent attempt to grapple with a serious issue, and thus is time well spent.",

This alone makes this book a good read.But there are also drawbacks:His assumption that a omniscient God doesn't know the future of sentient agents with free will shatters the whole concept of God's omniscience (to be fair, Swinburne recognizes this to some extent in citing a different view on this topic). But his free will thesis is a building block of his theodicy and runs into the question whether Swinburnes presupposed image of God is compatible with the christian image of God at all.Furthermore, Swinburne failed in conclusively showing that the Good outweighs the Evil in the world and that it is morally permissible for God to let an individual agent suffer in order to obtain a \"greater\" Good not connected to this agent.",

                "review/text": "Being familiar with some of Swinburne's other work, I was expecting first rate scholarship and was not disappointed in that regard. However, the scope of the book is limited and readers should be aware of this. Swinburne does not set out to describe how providence works or how it is administered. Nor does he explicitly consider specific arguments against evil put forth by particular atheologians (such as Mackie, Rowe, or Draper). Rather, Swinburne dedicates this book to depend Christian theism against his own formulation of the problem of evil while providing a great conceptual framework for further work in this area.In part I of the book, Swinburne argues that theism needs a theodicy and constructs an argument from evil to the conclusion that God does not exist (p.13). The argument is of the evidential type--arguing that there exists a certain type of evil which is incompatible with the existence of God. He also takes note of the various types of theodicy that the Christian tradition has utilized in the past. He then spends the next 75 pages--part II--describing various states of affairs which are good, including things like beauty, action, worshipping, being of use to others, etc. Part III of the book is the largest part and contains his extended argument that many of the goods described in part II cannot come about except by allowing some sort of evil. (For example, in order to be of use to others, abilities and talents must vary from person to person.) Much of what he says has been said before, but Swinburne's discussion is exhaustive and contains many interesting points (for example, the usefulness of sloth [156-8]). The final part of the book contains two arguments: first, that God has the right to bring about certain evil states as to allow other greater states, and secondly, that--ultimately--the argument from evil fails and that all evil we see are compatible with the existence of God. For this final portion Swinburne relies on various thought experiments to demonstrate the value of God creating the type of world we have.Despite all of this however, there are some weak points. First, as I noted the book seems slightly incomplete without a positive account of how God controls/exhibits providence over the world. Second, there are occasional tensions inside the text. Swinburne rejects both God's foreknowledge of future events and God's middle knowledge of counterfactuals of freedom (126-34). But often he describes God as acting on the basis of how people will respond to various things. For example, it is wrong for God to put people in situations where they be \"systematically deceived on important matters without their having the possibility of discovering their deception\" (139). But given his rejection of middle knowledge, God cannot guarantee such a thing, and so God must work from probabilities--but Swinburne does not discuss these extensively at all. Finally, Swinburne concludes that, in the actual world, \"each bad state or possible bad state removed takes away one actual good\" (219). But his very general considerations of good and bad states of affairs does not support this conclusion and it is very easy to imagine, in Swinburne's world, a bad state of affair which could be removed by God which would not take away any good state of affair.Overall, Swinburne's book can function as a solid grounding in theodicy. Perhaps it falters here and there, but it will provide a solid conceptual framework to build upon and modify. It also illustrates that the atheologian has a little more work that he might initially think. Another solid contribution to modern scholarship from Swinburne.",

                "review/text": "Lilly was a generation(or more) ahead of his time. He is almost single-handedly responsible for the great interest in dolphins(which led to the Marine Mammal Protection Act and helped to found the animal rights movement). In 1958 he noted that the brains of elephants and cetaceans were larger than ours, that we should not abuse them and that it was one our most important projects to communicate with them. He invented isolation tanks(at NIMH in 1954) and used them extensively with and without powerful psychoactive drugs at a time when it was thought that either the brain would shut down or one would go insane. He created methods for implanting electrodes in mammal brains and was planning to do it to himself. He was one of the first to make serious use of computers in bioscience research and created the hardware and software to make the first attempts to communicate with dolphins. He self experimented with dangerous physiological investigations in high altitude medicine for the military during WW2, took LSD with dolphins and movie stars, submitted himself to the rigors of Arica training, and taught classes at Esalen. He was the first one to investigate the bizarre psychedelic ketamine and his results(published in the two last chapters of this book `The Scientist`) are still the best data on the dose/effect relation of any psychedelic on one person. And all this happened before most of us were born!He had courage, honesty and integrity that is rare anywhere and almost nonexistent in science. His goal was to find the ultimate truth about everything and he went about as far as anyone ever has. He had little patience with the stupid and hypocritical games one has to play to fit into monkey society. Of course the reaction of the establishment was predictable. He left the NIMH and was never given any government or academic support for the last 35 years of his life. His paper and comments at a conference on sensory deprivation were removed from the published version. He was not invited to government sponsored symposia on dolphins(he had refused to help develop them as weapons), though he clearly knew more about them than anyone in the world.He liked to live and work on the edge and few could keep up with him, as this books makes clear. If you have read some of his other books it will be much easier going. He was a pioneer in consciousness research and pushed the boundaries of our understanding of who we are and what we might become. Among other things he catalogs here the various states reached by drugs, meditation, and isolation, tries to determine their significance and suggests how to use them.As a result of all his research, especially his months of continuous hourly injections of ketamine, he became convinced that our ordinary reality was not the only one. During his trips he was often in communication with members of a civilization a 1000 years in the future. We all allow ourselves such experiences every time we watch a sci fi movie and sometimes it leaves us more than just amused, but when anyone meditates or takes a drug to do it we tend to discount the results. Lilly however, took it all seriously, and parts of this book explain why. Whatever our mind produces --by any means --only happens because our brains are programmed by our genes to make it possible. So it's at least plausible that any of these routes inward reveal fundamental aspects of what's possible for us in the future, or even for some other species elsewhere in the universe. If you find his scientifically based viewpoints irrational, consider that most people believe without evidence(really with abundant evidence to the contrary) in good and bad luck, in super beings living in space who rule the earth, in a place in spacetime where dead people go, in stars millions of light years away influencing their lives, and in ghosts, angels, witches, and gods that come to earth to inhabit statues that read our thoughts and violate all the laws of physics, chemisty and biology in order to help us personally.He describes his tank work(and lots more) in The Dyadic Cyclone, The Center of the Cyclone, and in Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer(1967) and other books, and his work with dolphins in Lilly on Dolphins and in Dolphins(CK TITLES).This book is a plea to examine your beliefs with an open mind.He defines metabeliefs as those about belief systems. He says that our simulations of reality(with meditaion, isolation, drugs, computers) can provide access to other realities which may include the future, the past, or extraterrestrial. He refers to metaprograms as learning tools(symbols, programs, languages, ideas, models) which our central programs(mind or part of it) runs all the time. Cognitive psychology did not really exist then and now we would likely call the central programs cognitive templates.He refers to self-metaprograms(or essences) as parts of the mind that program our experiences.Though he carried out an exhausting and dangerous program of self experimentation with psychedelics(what many now call entheogens), he does not believe they are a final or complete path to higher consciousness. Yes as I reflect on this, I note that tens of millions have successfully explored their cognitive templates with psychedelics while meditation alone may have generated a few hundred thousand satoris and probably less than 100 living mystics. It is also clear that psychedelics have led millions to meditation. He mentions the very psychedelic Revelations of St. John and understands that Jesus taught revelation from within--ie the same sort of self transcendence at Taoism and Buddhism. He discusses how we use drugs, sex, money, groups, war etc as substitutes for God. God as compassion, science, consciousness or superspace(the current concepts of cosmology are explained and he imagines the universe collpasing and being reborn--very contemporary!). He discusses god in here vs god out there but notes that if its out there then its a puzzle where math comes from. His experiences make him doubt that death is the end.He was very open to all ideas and his desire to consider all points of view makes some parts of the book rambling and a bit incoherent. He crams so many ideas on each page that there is easily enough here to form the core of ten books. He is mentions ideas such as: war is the result of a future civilization using us for war games; we are god simulating himself, our interstellar rockets finding intelligent machines that follow us back to earth and take over; government sponsored meditation classes, computers that control and monitor all communication and take control of civilization, our genes generate the illusion that we live in a certain and determinate universe; we are simulated by God or vice versa.Though he must have crossed paths countless time with Indian mystics and Buddhists, strangely, he was most influenced by an obscure American mystic named Franklin Merrell-Wolff.Lilly was an extremely bright and highly rational person yet he became convinced of the reality of his extraterrestrial membership in a future civilization and he went into a 6 week depression after a ketamine trip in which they showed him the collapse of the universe.It was clear to him that the phenomena of the mind were capable of scientific study but this was quite heretical 40 years ago.The book ends with reprints of some of his papers and poems.",

Yet I have always felt that there remains a need for the roles that religion has filled in the past, even though I haven't felt clear on exactly how it might do so in a workable fashion. Don Cupitt shows some very plausible ways it might. He boils down religion to recurrent essentials, and tailors them together in a way that does not offend the sensibilities of rational thinking people.He takes a very good metaphorical approach instead of getting bogged down in issues of literal existence where inevitable clashes with science would otherwise turn off more empirically minded people. I came to read his book after reading George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's &quot;Metaphors we Live By&quot; and &quot;Philosophy in the Flesh.&quot; This gave me a much deeper appreciation for the metaphorical undertaking that Cupitt delves into as well as providing a deep context of cognitive science within which Cupitt's thinking manifestly makes a lot of sense. Fundamentalists and hard core atheists may not like his approach. I think otherwise most people will appreciate his thoughtfulness.Cupitt points in the right direction with his emphasis on the linguistic, however he seems to lack the cognitive science background to flesh out those theories with the more primordial cognitive underpinning structure. Lakoff and Johnson prove good for that purpose. Of course that would have made his task unwieldy for such a concise and to the point book.

                "review/text": "In 1906, the American composer Charles Ives wrote a short orchestral piece called \"The Unanswered Question\". He described the music as a \"cosmic drama.\" The piece is indeed a musical picture of the human search for meaning and religion and a world full of skepticism about both. (Ives himself was a believer of a rather traditional sort.)I thought of Ives, and his \"Unanswered Question\" in reading Don Cupitt's short study \"After God\". Cupitt is a fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge and his written widely on religious subjects. He is the founder of the \"Sea of Faith\" movement, which is an attempt to provide meaning for religion in a non-theistic, non-traditional sense.The book is modernistic in tone. It is addressed to the many people who attempt to find a form of religion in their lives separate from theism. In setting out his topic Cupit states: \"Religious life is an expressive, world-building activity through which we can get ourselves together and find a kind of posthumous, or retrospective, happiness\". (page xiv)The book is in three parts. In the first part, \"The Coming of the Gods\", Cupitt tries to give a historical, genetic account of the origins of theistic belief, based on the development of cities and ruling hierarchies from more primitive hunting or agrarian societies. He finds both religion and early philosophy deriviative of this change in human social organization.In the second section, \"The Departure of the Gods\" Cupitt explores the difficulties in the concept of a transcendent God separate from the imminent world of the everyday. He talks insigtfully, if too briefly, of the development of philosophy from the objective realism of Plato (both the chief hero and the chief villian of the book) through Kant's internalization of the sources of human knowledge, through Nietsche and modern philosophy of language. His position straddles, I think, postmodern thought, which denies the possiblity of any absolute truth separate from the observer, and a more traditional philosophical naturalism (denial of supernaturalism) where I think it is ultimately more comfortable.The third part of the book \"Religion after the Gods\" offers a new version of religion stripped of its theological trappings. Cupitt adopts a three-fold religious practice from the wisdom of the past, consisting of 1. attempting to see one's life through the eye of eternity 2. meditation on emptiness and 3. \"solar living\" -- a radiant, outgoing way of life based on emotion and human need, receptive to change and to the moment, and concerned with immanences here and now rather than fixed absolutes. Cupitt sees religion as ultimately global in character, breaking down the tendency of believers to separate themselves and their creed from other parts of humanity. Strangely enough, he closes the book with advice that people remain in their current religious traditions, but follow them in a manner consistent with the teachings of his book.Cupitt writes eloquently and well. I am in sympathy with much of his programme, but he moves too quickly at times. There is a sense in his book of the mystery and enigma that Ives presents so well in \"the unanswered question\"; although, paradoxically, Cupitt seems too eager to disolve the mystery by creating a dogma of his own.Those wanting to hear more of Cupitt might be interested in looking up his interview with Steven Batchelor in the Fall, 2003,issue of \"Tricycle, the Buddhist Review.\"",

                "review/text": "A challenging book indeed. Cupitt's challenge makes Spong's challenge seem easy, Spong's challenge, while not easy, seeming intellectually a far simple one for those of us who have already long ago dismissed supernaturalism as anything other than a convenient deception. Cupitt's wide sweep though Western history can be mind-blowing but it's especially the views he has arrived at that pulled the rug out. Cupitt claims to be \"at home with nihilism\" albeit an ethical nihilism and able to \"do without roots, identity, stability, or provenance\". [ I admit I had to look up \"provenance\", it means, in case you also didn't know \"place or source of origin\" ]. He speaks of the value of \"deferring objectivity\" to arrive at a subjective and \"nonrealist\" vision. Not easy to follow and certainly something I would need not only a second read but much thought to make useful sense of. Cupitt (who has launched a Sea of Faith movement after a British TV series he conceived of the same name) seems to find a value in traditional religions simply in the \"tricks and techniques\" they have gathered to help us be a self and relate to the world. Otherwise, he seems eager to explore the creation of a new world religion, one not at all easy for him or others, he admits, to define, but all the more critical if we are to respond to the crises of our time. That he does not advocate the abandonment altogether of religions, old or to be created, is one of the challenges of this book and Cupitt. He addresses that challenge especially at the end of the book, turning to such themes as \"The Eye of God\", \"The Blissful Void\", \"Solar Living\" and \"Poetic Theology\" to try to communicate his insights.If postmodernity has led to Tillich, Spong, and Altizer, it now comes full weight upon us in Cupitt. It's hard to know what to make of it but there is a sound logic and sense of historical development in Cupitt's thought that seems to me to deserve further and serious consideration. As to where it might lead me,if anywhere, of value, I don't know. But I don't think I can ignore Cupitt's challenge.",

                "review/text": "Don Cupitt is a Christian who does not believe in a God &quot;out there&quot;, but a God who is part of the human reality. He has been publishing approximately a book a year since the late 1970s on what the implications of a &quot;non-realist&quot; God are for religion and Christianity. As the former Priest and Dean of Emmanuel College Cambridge (he is now retired), Don Cupitt's Christianity is not simply an intellectual position, but a practical part of his life.The book is divided up into three parts: The Coming of the Gods, the Departure of the Gods and Religion After the Gods. This review will first summarise the book then discuss the issues it raises.The Coming of the Gods deals with how God and the supernatural world were originally experienced. Soul was the principle of life, usually associated with blood and therefore usually embodied. Spirit on the other hand was usually not embodied, it was an active free-ranging power, sometimes helping sometimes tormenting. Spirits are sometimes called powers or energies. They are semi-personified, they are many of them (they are sometimes members of a &quot;host&quot; or &quot;legion&quot;), and they rarely have names. Angels and Demons are a little more personified - a few of the angels are given names, scarcely any devils. Spirits have five types of relationship with humans: humans can be filled with a spirit, a spirit may be a guardian, may inspire, indwell or possess you.A &quot;god&quot; a symbol of a group. Cupitt argues that the earliest Old Testament traditions identify God as the &quot;bull of Jacob&quot; (Gen 49:24) (the NIV translates it as &quot;Mighty One of Jacob&quot; but Cupitt argues that this is because the translators find it too embarrassing find the God of the Old Testament as a tribal deity). Gods are different to Spirits because they are lords, who sit enthroned and who lay down the law. Cupitt explains that originally Ancient Egypt had 700 gods, but as the political system united the different tribes, the one group, the nation of Egypt, needed a single God. So as cities replaced nomads, so gods replaced spirits.Cupitt cites another reason for the change from spirits to gods. Spirits swarm, cluster, rustle and whisper in our heads. As an anonymous legion they are fearsome. But when we start to name them we demythologise them and they lose their power. So this supernatural world of religion turns out to be a myth of the origin of language, and the process of naming is part of the development of consciousness.As cities and nations begin to develop, so the need to law and authority arises, and so the concept of a &quot;god&quot; develops. Spirits wander freely in the wilderness and know nothing of the law, by contrast the god is the origin and authority of the law, of regulation: of space and time, private property and an ordered, regular calendar. Cupitt explains the reality of these gods as being similar to the reality of Donald Duck today. There is no superior original Donald Duck - all the Donald Ducks produced by Disney are &quot;real&quot;, so the god wasn't something over and beyond the statue or image, the god was the image.According to Cupitt god arose when someone asked the system to justify itself. God arose as part of critical thinking, questioning god was part of the very first experience of god. Think of the stories in the Old Testament where God is argued with. Abraham is the father of the Jews, but also someone who does not hesitate to argue with God.Greek philosophy, argues Cupitt, far from being a new way of thinking, was just a secularised version of this religious outlook. Metaphysical laws replace the authority of the god, but the outlook is still looking outside and beyond, Objective knowledge of the Real.So to conclude the first part, The Coming of the Gods, the gods turn out to be named, ordered, structured reality - language. They were needed to help humanity develop consciousness (worshipping the god of deer was just another way of keeping the concept of &quot;deer&quot; in the mind when the hunter went to hunt them). They were needed to justify the new order of kings and priests in towns, cities and nations. Hence the religious concern for language: holy books, creeds, blasphemy (&quot;bad&quot; language), the names of god, even the Logos.The Departure of the Gods begins with a chapter called &quot;Mysticism&quot; in which Cupitt notes how god has always been seen as a mysterious part of reality. Look at other words which seem to overlap with the word &quot;God&quot;: fate, luck, chance, history, things, it, it all, the throw of the dice, destiny, time, how it does, and so on. God becomes part of reality. Even the classic definition of God, as infinite and so on, seems to dissolve God into everything and nothing, so the idea of God seems to contain within it the mystical idea of God dissolving into the world, or the self blending into God (the &quot;spiritual marriage&quot;), but those mystics who went too far with this idea were punished by the religious authorities who rightly understood that this meant the death of a realist God.Cupitt noted earlier how philosophy began as a secular form of religion. In this section he notes how this tradition, philosophy as footnotes to Plato, the philosophy of metaphysical entities, is now passing. Critical philosophy is destroying the idea that our world is mere appearance, beneath which lies the world of God, Truth and Happiness. This distinction itself has now become unintelligible.If you imagine yourself walking down a corridor, you imagine a view outside of yourself. It is natural to think objectivity, not subjectivity, and for much of history, the subjective viewpoint has been unimaginable. Only relatively recently, and with great difficulty, has culture been able to discover the subjective.Cupitt concludes the section on The Departure of the Gods by noting that the &quot;nomad&quot;, whom the gods originally replaced with the city dweller, is now returning. With the departure of the gods, law, order and tradition are crumbling, to be replaced by the nomad:&quot;Instead of marriage, a series of relationships; instead of home, a series of addresses; instead of a career, freelancing; instead of a church, the irregularly mushrooming politics of protest; instead of a faith, whatever one is currently &quot;into&quot;; instead of stable identities, pluralism and flux; instead of society, themarket and one's own circle&quot; (p. 74).In the final section, Religion After the Gods, Cupitt asks what religion might be like in this new age. It follows from the analysis of part two that for Cupitt all the major religious traditions are now coming to an end. All they are now good for is taking whatever may be of use to us in the future. Cupitt believes there are three concepts worth stealing: the Eye of God, the Blissful Void and Solar Living.These doctrines are not, of course, true in themselves. &quot;In the future we will see our religion not as supernatural doctrine but as an experiment in selfhood&quot; (p. 82). They are simply useful techniques, useful stories.The Eye of God means living as if God is watching us. Living from the standpoint of eternity. This obviously makes our life more serious, more ethical. Meister Eckhart says that the eye with which we look at God is the same eye as the eye with which God looks at us. The fact that we take the place of God simply means we heighten our consciousness (&quot;a serious postmodern definition of true religion: religion which makes you smarter than your god&quot; (p. 85)). Indeed the fact that God is absent means for Cupitt that he loves him all the more: &quot;I actually think I love God more now that I know God is voluntary. I still pray and love God, even though I fully acknowledge that no God actually exists. Perhaps God had to die in order to purify our love for him... Kierkegaard says the love we feel for our dead is the most faithful and the most purely unselfish of all our loves&quot; (pp. 85-86).The Blissful Void Cupitt takes from Buddhism, in which the subject is emptied out into void bliss. Cupitt says the Blissful Void can also be called the cool sublime, and contrasts it with Kant's sublime. For Kant the sublime (the mathematical sublime and the dynamical sublime) is out experience of the vastness of nature, and our response in feeling exaltation at our mastery of such forces through mathematics and reason. Instead Cupitt argues we respond to such forces by seeing ourselves as infinitely unimportant, we disappear into nothingness. The sublime is now, we are swallowed up into the void.Solar Living means thinking of our lives as burning up like the sun. As we live we burn, our life is just a pouring out of energy until we are burnt up. We pour ourselves out, and this is our existence. Our truth isn't something deep within our unconscious, it is our actions, our creation. Cupitt calls this &quot;postsainthood&quot;, we live by dying all the time.Cupitt then goes back to address the obvious objection made his claim that all the main religious traditions are coming to an end.

The author considers contemporary versions of arguments for the existence of God and demonstrates them to be deeply flawed. The author makes the case that the existence of the tri-omni God has empirically verifiable consequences and that taken together, absence of evidence for God's existence and evidence of God's absence render God's existence highly improbable. Everitt further demonstrates that many of God's traditional attributes (e.g., omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, omnibenevolence) when considered in conjunction, show God's existence to be self-contradictory and hence that God's existence is not only improbable (given evidential considerations), but is impossible (given logical considerations).Everitt sets up no straw men. He fairly presents what are generally considered to be among the best contemporary theistic arguments available and systematically dismantles them. Throughout he also considers possible theistic rebuttals to atheistic critiques and exposes their impotence. This well-written and carefully argued book is highly recommended to both theists, who wish to challenge their faith by the fire of reason and to non-believers, who will gain greater sophistication in their arguments for the non-existence of God.",

                "review/text": "First, the good news: Everitt's book is clearly written and well organized. He has read a fair amount of the relevant literature, and in his suggested readings at the end of each chapter he is quite evenhanded, recommending books by authors like Richard Swinburne and Stephen T. Davis, with whom he disagrees deeply, as well as books by his fellow unbelievers.Now the not so good news: Everitt's treatment of the arguments for the existence of God is not particularly sophisticated, and in places he fails to engage with some of the most important recent work. This comes out very clearly in chapter 6, where he discusses arguments to and from miracles. He mentions neither David Johnson's workHume, Holism, and Miracles (Cornell Studies in the Philosophy of Religion)nor Robert Fogelin'sA Defense of Hume on Miracles (Princeton Monographs in Philosophy). He mentions but fails to engage with John Earman's bookHume's Abject Failure: The Argument Against Miracles, a significant omission since Earman's work is inter alia a sustained and sophisticated critique of the conclusion Everitt takes Hume to have established -- that even in the most favorable circumstances possible, it would not be rational to believe that a miracle has occurred. (Everitt, p. 116) The chapter on miracles has no discussion of Bayes's Theorem and the role it plays in contemporary reconstructions of the argument from testimony to the miraculous, though Everitt has (very gingerly) introduced a bit of Bayesian reasoning on p. 77 in his discussion of Swinburne's cosmological argument.The presentation of Hume's argument against miracles follows J. L. Mackie's presentation inThe Miracle of Theism: Arguments For and Against the Existence of God, stressing the claim that if the overall evidence makes it rational for us to believe that a putative event M was a violation of the laws of nature, then that same overall evidence makes it irrational for us to believe that M actually occurred. (See p. 117.) Everitt shows no awareness of the problems lurking here. It is not clear how the inverse claim should be construed (is it the claim that P(M violates the laws of nature) = 1 - P(M actually occurred)? or that for all E, if P(M violates the laws of nature|E) > P(M violates the laws of nature), then P(M actually occurred|E) &lt; P(M actually occurred)? or ... ?); and under almost any interesting construal it stands in need of argument that it never receives. Everitt asserts without argument that if a miracle is a violation of a law of nature it is maximally improbable (p. 115), showing no awareness of the long history of criticism of this claim from the early 1700s onward.Everitt's attempt to give a fourfold classification of concepts of miracle is another place where deeper engagement with recent work, e.g. Robert Larmer'sWater into Wine?: An Investigation of the Concept of Miracle, would have helped him to focus the discussion. Some accounts deserve to be taken more seriously (and understood more fairly) than they are. Ironically, one of these is an account proposed by J. L. Mackie, which Everitt (p. 119) misunderstands and therefore dismisses out of hand. Other, less plausible proposals get nearly equal time. These latter are not exactly straw men, for Everitt does try to find people who have defended them. But those familiar with the field are likely to think that they deserve more neglect than Everitt has given them.The chapter on the ontological argument is another place where Everitt's presentation is light on detail. There is no discussion of Kurt Godel's ontological argument, for example; and even the versions discussed are mostly informal, verbal versions, though for the discussion of Hartshorne's version he cannot avoid a few lines of modal logic. Here I am more sympathetic to Everitt, since I think that the ontological argument fails in all of its forms. But even the criticisms he levels against Plantinga's formulation, for example, do not do full justice to the subtlety of the argument.The chapters that attempt to show the incoherence of the traditional concept of God are, on the whole, quite weak. Everitt argues, for example, that Big Bang cosmology shows that past time was finite, and he concludes from this that God, conceived of as an eternal being, cannot exist, since (according to Big Bang cosmology) nothing has had infinite duration. Neither the premise nor the inference is backed by a compelling line of argument. Everitt is following the lead of others and should not shoulder full blame for this particular weak argument. Still, it is a bruised reed for atheism to lean on.Perhaps the worst chapter in the entire volume is chapter 11, on Arguments from Scale. Everitt urges that the sheer age and size of the universe as revealed by modern astronomy provide evidence against theism. The argument depends entirely on the premise that \"humans are the jewel of creation\" -- by which Everitt means at least that if God exists, we would expect every aspect of the created universe to be \"on a human scale\" both temporally and spatially. (p. 215) This claim, however, reveals nothing except the poverty of Everitt's theological knowledge. The whole argument was effectively buried by Thomas Chalmers in hisDiscourses on the Christian revelation viewed in connection with the modern astronomy(1817). It is painful to see a contemporary author trying to resurrect it in the service of infidelity.The concluding chapter attempts to draw together the various lines of argument, and naturally the strength of such a summary depends in part on the success of the arguments preceding it. But in this case there are other reasons to be dissatisfied with Everitt's own attempt to sum up his case. He makes some needless and baffling claims, e.g., that one can have empirical disconfirmation for a self-contradictory proposition like (p & ~p). (See p. 304.) Worse, he fails to see how different theistic proofs with somewhat different conclusions may be coordinated in an overall cumulative case for the existence of God, an epistemological issue discussed with great subtlety and finesse by Richard Swinburne inThe Existence of God. Of course, Everitt thinks that the arguments are all failures, or at least that they are all very weak. But his substantive evaluation, even if it were backed up by better argument, should be distinguished from the structural question of how a cumulative case is constructed -- not only in religion but in almost any field. Everitt's treatment of this important topic is disappointingly weak.In fairness, it is very difficult to write a book of moderate size on this vast topic. Mackie's book, for all its flaws, remains the classic treatment of its size. For anything even approaching a full-scale treatment of these issues from the side of unbelief, one needs a work three times as long like Jordan Howard Sobel'sLogic and Theism: Arguments For and Against Beliefs in God. But Sobel's book is really written for the professional philosopher who is familiar with modal logic, probability theory, and transfinite mathematics. Everitt's book is not, and for that very reason it is both vastly more accessible and vastly less powerful than Sobel's. Each work has the defects of its qualities.",

Another is that he hits on subjects that are so specific to issues that we all face, but no one else seems to bring up. For instance, one day he talks about offending his sister in Christ. It wasn't on purpose. His intentions were good, but were they? There is still evil at war within the flesh and in an attempt to do good, some bad might have been done and so forgiveness and reconciliation is sought after recognizing his weakness and confessing it. But wait, I had just done that and it was to a sister in Christ whom I cared for. I'd never thought about it like that. I always have &quot;good&quot; intentions or I thought I did.

The title of the book says it is inspiration for the unmarried, but I believe that description is somewhat misleading, for the devotions are for all who have felt the ache of isolation during their spiritual journey (and who among us, married or not, have not felt this way?). The writing speaks to that breaking loneliness we all have in our hearts, how to honestly wrestle with it, and like Jacob and the angel, come away blessed. The devotions also serve as warnings not to buy into the culturally scripted metaphors which all too often pervade our notions of what it means to be single or married (if you are single there is something wrong, if you are married, everything is ok). Mr. Warden's book reminds us that God is passionately and relentlessly consumed with making us more like Him, with making us fall so deeply in love with Him that we lead full, adventurous lives because we are part of a bigger story.

        "description": "Science vs. Religion shows that the scientific discoveries of the past 150 years prove God exists beyond a reasonable doubt. Our universe is carefully designed to allow life and human development. The universe started with a \"Big Bang,\" the beginning of space and time. There is no 'before' before the Bang, and science does not know what caused it. Darwin's Theory of Evolution appears to do away with God, but there is enormous controversy among Darwin scientists as to how evolution works. Other scientists raise critical objections. Darwinism is not proven. Scientists don't know how life got started, because living matter, even single-celled forms, have been found to be extremely complex. This book proposes, for those who have faith in God and for those who have chosen not to accept God on faith, if they study scientific discoveries they will find overwhelming evidence of the Hand of God.",

                "review/text": "I am the author:There is a need to present to the average reading public an overview of the science and theology dialogue now being carried on only at a very academic level. Dr. Turell has written a review of the field of the interaction of science and religion, for high school level readers who want or need an introduction to this area of intellectual discourse. Although it covers contributions from both secularist authors and also scientists who believe in God, Turell does, however, like John Polkinghorne and Richard Swinburne, conclude that the past 150 years of science logically prove the existence of God. Turell uses the method in Mortimer J. Adler's book, How to Think About God; A Guide for the 20th Century Pagan, proposing to prove the existence of God `beyond a reasonable doubt.'After describing his own background, explaining why he wished to write the book, Turell presents a review of the current adversaries in the `war'. A simple view of the cosmology of the universe is described in the Chapter, Our Designer Universe Fine-Tuned for Life. After understanding that the universe allows life, the reader is introduced to the scientific research difficulties in determining how life might have gotten started naturally from inorganic matter. The fact that evolution occurred is strongly supported, as a direct answer to the contentions of `young earth' creationists. However, all of the problems with the Darwin Theory, especially the controversies between Darwin scientists, for example, the marked differences between Simon Conway Morris and Stephen J. Gould, are reviewed.In the chapter, Our Hat Size is too Big for Darwin, is the presentation of the issue as to why should a species appear with such a massive intellect, not really required by nature for survival? There follows a discussion of consciousness, and the philosophic problem of recognizing that somehow `mind' appears out of matter. This leads naturally to a discussion on near-to-death and out-of-the-body phenomena and university level research into psychic phenomena. Turell concludes with his reasons for believing in the existence of God, and then discusses applications of this decision, for example' how to teach Darwin in the public schools indicating all the problems with his theory.Dr. Turell is a retired internist, who was in medical practice for over 30 years. After all of his scientific education he became an agnostic, but unsatisfied with that philosophic position, he spent over two decades reading more than 100 books, innumerable articles in scientific and lay journals and magazines before reaching his conclusions. This book really represents an autobiographical review of his research.",

                "review/text": "I find Science vs. Religion is a very worthwhile book. It is chock full of scientists' 20th Century findings and philosophers' up-to-date thoughts about the universe, life, intelligence and how all this bears on whether God exists.If readers aren't interested in this subject matter, they must be wholly without curiosity.The argument for the existence of God that struck me as the most convincing (page 122) is the finding that the human brain grew four times larger during the 2.5 million years it took for hominids to become humans. This cannot be attributed to Darwinian gradualism. We had no need for so large a brain so soon. Why did our brain, and only ours, grow so relatively fast? Maybe there is a God, a playful one.On the other hand, it is argued on page 183 that \"if a first cause was caused, then it could not be a first cause. It must be God\". I'd say it must be an \"Occam's Razor\" issue, as the Razor is explained in the book, with no need to evoke God as a deductive explanation. The \"Big Bang\" may simply be the \"Big Bang\", having no cause, not requiring the invention of an explanation.I like the book's \"argument from consciousness\" (page 206), that \"we are aware that we are aware,\" and we have the intellectual capacity that might help us duck another asteroid like the one that killed off the dinosaurs and might later move to another hospitable solar system before our sun dies. Our helpful God at work again?All this is every interesting and thought-provoking, and I'm for it. The book is great. I've enjoyed reading it and thinking about it, and I'll probably use it as a reference for years to come.Yet I remain an agnostic, one who respects believers but who can't ever quite make it into the fold.Part of my trouble is that I don't understand what good it does anyone for me to hold a set of beliefs concerning God. Morals and ethics, yes, but not God Himself. I can only speculate as to whether He exists and if so, why?",

                "review/text": "Doctor Turell writes in a profoundly engaging and intellectually playful way. The tone of his approach to SCIENCE vs. RELIGION is friendly and collegial, not ponderous. This tone is a key to the success of his book. However, Turell also comprehensively, accurately, and carefully reviews the serious scientific, philosophical, and theological literature that bears on his topic. By the means of presenting and synthesizing a depth and density of facts and data, Turell brings the reader steadily to contemplate his compelling and profound conclusions.Dr. Turell is candid about his personal journey in search of God that entwines with his writing of this book. This personal investment of energy enlivens Turell's creative work. Lets examine how Dr. Turell proceeds with his journey that becomes our journey as his readers.Chapter 1 (Enemies or Helpmates) frames the key elements of a respectful, honest and productive debate between Scientists and Creationists. Turell's quote of Pope John Paul II, sums it up beautifully: \"Science can purify religion from error and superstition, and religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes\". Chapter 2 (Our Designer Universe Fine-Tuned for Life) summarizes the fascinating findings of astronomy and cosmology of the 20th century and beyond. There are \"Big Bangs\" and big chemical events described as Turell concludes that only the God of \"Intelligent Design\" could have programmed a safe place for our existence. As usual he presents views to the contrary fairly. Chapter 3 (Is Life a Glorious Accident? No Chance), visits the intensely conflicted and often misunderstood and misrepresented world of Darwin's ideas. Roll-up your intellectual sleeves for this encounter! Chapter 4 (Is The Evolution of Humans a Glorious Accident?) takes us deeper into the Darwin trek by information-dense discussion of the implications of recent findings from geology, archeology and the implications of DNA for human evolution. Turell makes no excuses for complexity in our destiny and its religious implications. Chapter 5 (Our Hat Size Is Too Big for Darwin), gets into the implications that our large brain size, language development, and consciousness/self-consciousness has for transcendent religious experiences as a reflection of God's presence. Hold your hats for this discussion! Chapter 6 (Hallucination or Glimpse of the Afterlife?) soars into the fascinating territories of Near Death Experiences and Out of Body Experiences. Turell carefully presents distilled data from many sources about these spiritually enlightening and conscientiously documented medical phenomena. Dr. Turell follows the trail left by the implications of these unusual forms of human conscious experience. Does he jolt you with this conclusion? \"My guess is our life-after-life is not somewhere else. It is probably right here with us. Generally, in our three dimensional form, we are not aware of it, but my theory suggests it is not difficult to cross over and come back at the quantum level, since quantum particles can be in two places at the same time.\" (p171). Chapter 7 (Belief in God Through Rational Philosophy) is a scholarly and penetrating journey that integrates Turell's previous discussions of the design of the universe and ourselves with the implications of our Consciousness that leads to the conclusion that God exists. Competent philosophers and theologians would respect this chapter regardless of their conclusion about the existence of God. Chapter 8 (Reflections on a Personal Theology) is a gem because Dr. Turell expresses his personal convictions and conclusions with the same candor and collegial tone that characterizes the entire book.For the reader who stays attentive to the information and relentlessly persuasive synthesis that Turell provides, there will be rich personal rewards.Peter A.

                "review/text": "Dr. Turell's book resonated with me because it crossed many trails I have pursued myself in terms of its reflection on the foundations for God's existence and presence in the world, while adding the personal perspective of the author on his own search for spiritual comfort with the Designer. I have been a fan of Mortimer Adler, whose philosophical approach to God Turell borrows, for many years and have monitored with interest the arguments of the proponents of intelligent design and the anthropic principle, as well as the explanations of the deficiencies of Darwinism as a final theory. Dr. Turell weaves all these threads together with a personal touch, and provides some suggestions for compromises in certain aspects of the cultural war that have merit as well as some helpful tips for other pilgrims. A very worthwhile addition to the dialogue to which I am sure to return.",

It seems that this part of our lives, which we claim is central, is often difficult to put into words. But if you know God, shouldn't you be able to describe him? What is he like? How can we put his eternal attributes into words? Join Chip Ingram in this fascinating study of seven attributes of God: his goodness, sovereignty, holiness, wisdom, justice, love, and faithfulness. Readers will see God in a whole new light and discover that our view of God impacts every decision in our lives. It will change the way we pray, the way we live, and the way we think about the world around us. God longs for us to know him as he really is. Get ready to meet God again for the first time.",

There is no illusion of Chip as super-Christian in this book, it is delightfully honest and readers of all ages and stages can relate to the simple yet powerful truths which transformed Chip's life. The book consists of ten chapters, seven of which are devoted to the attributes of God. The chapters are loaded with probing questions about your deepest beliefs. The attributes chapters include: \"Tools for Transformation,\" key passages and scriptures to focus on for the coming week; a prayer to contemplate; as well as a personal insight into Chip's life which draws the reader into an intimate communication with the author as friend.Drawing from the Word of God, A.W. Tozer's Knowledge of the Holy, and J.I. Packer's Knowing God, Chip presents solid, intelligent arguments about who God is, and how He longs to be seen. Quoting Dr. Charles Ryrie, Chip's former professor, readers are challenged throughout the book to determine if in fact they really do, as they may profess, trust God. In the appendix is a \"Vision Test\" which aids the reader in determining their trust/view of God.The meat of Chip's message is provided in substantial pieces for readers to really chew on. Some books are difficult to get through because they are wearisome, not this one, I was challenged and inspired by it and did not want it to end. This book is a sound investment for any reader. Buy two copies and study it with a friend. This book would be an excellent Bible study with life changing results. If you only buy one book this year, let it be this one.

So it was a great delight to find this book, and I must say I was completly floored by the depth yet simplicity of this book as it explored the true charecteristics of God and what that means to us as his creation. Chip outlines the characteristics of God and splashes practical vibrant insight into how these characteristics, when properly looked at and applied, can radically change your life. Trust me when I say that you will never look at God or his relationship with you in the same light again after reading this book. For example many of us believe that if we submit to God, he will make us do things we don't want to do! Rubbish?? God gave us all the ultimate gift--His Son--so why would he start being stingy now?? Get this book and discover God the way he wants you to discover him!!",
